On this, our first call for calendar year 2021, we are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly,",2637,"Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on today's call. On this, our first call for calendar year 2021, we are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly, we all want to see faster production and wider distribution so that people be safe from COVID-19 and free to open up their communities and free to get back to their lives. We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians as well as providers, patients and ResMedians around the 140-plus countries that we operate in.
In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD and asthma are steadily increasing, modestly improving on the trends we saw in the September 2020 quarter. We're seeing this improvement of patient flow even as second and third waves come through Northern Winter Hemisphere nations because physicians and providers are adopting digital health, which enables patient engagement, even when people cannot or do not want to meet live and in person.
In my remarks today, I will provide a high-level overview of our December Q2 FY '21 business results and then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on the financials. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities.
Today, we have published and reported solid high single-digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results once again speak to ResMed team's ability to work innovatively and deliver results even when facing lower patient activity and little-to-no incremental benefit from ventilator sales. 
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders. We have also grown research and development investments in digital health technology as well as hardware, software and clinical research. We forecast increasing digital health demand from patients, from physicians, from providers and from health care systems as they embrace remote patient monitoring and they adopt data-driven population health management systems. 
We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers, with an industry-leading IP portfolio, including over 6,000 patents and designs. 
Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences and to drive lower health care system costs.
We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. We have sold over 13.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed, and we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud.
With these data liberator to the cloud, we can unlock value for all of our customer groups. We can unlock value for patients through myAir, we can unlock value for physicians through AirView and we can unlock value for IDNs, payer providers as well as private and government insurers for data-driven population health management. That's the future of health care.
The goals we share with all of our customers are these three: one, to improve patient outcomes, patient quality of life, patient chronic disease outcomes; two, to lower overall health care system costs; and three, to bend the curve of chronic disease progression. To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look out here at ResMed are, of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type 2 diabetes, with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond.
During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID has continued to accelerate the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world. We are seeing the recognition of the value of remote patient screening, virtual diagnosis, remote patient management and a rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models in many of the nations that we serve patients. As an example of just one of these, Germany, during the quarter, approved reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices, including our digital 3D printed dental sleep apnea, product called NARVAL. This is the first time Germany has approved such a product type to treat Sleep Avenue. In addition, several German states are looking at and experimenting with digital health reimbursement models. These are exciting developments, and we expect this will benefit our German business over time.
We have also seen other national governments, including France, Japan and the United States where they've adopted models and taken action to accelerate digital health adoption.
Remote health care is of incredible importance during this COVID-19 pandemic, but digital health is also valuable well beyond the impact of COVID because it provides better availability of health care, it provides excellent quality care for patients, and it provides significantly lower costs for health care systems worldwide. These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy. We believe the accelerated adoption of Digital Health solutions represents a significant and permanent shift of the adoption curve for ResMed's market-leading digital health solutions.
Let me now briefly update you on our top 3 strategic priorities. These 3 priorities are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions, and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home.
In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends as well as very strong resupply activity, both of which have supported another quarter of solid revenue growth that you can see in the numbers we just released. We're seeing 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States, and to take an example of a Europe in the country, in Germany, we're already back to 85 to 90-plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow.
Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70-plus percent, 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market. Obviously, the recovery rates of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy may be impacted by the typical seasonality we see in our largest market here in the United States in the March quarter, as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of the calendar year. This is as per normal.
This seasonal impact affects devices more than it affects mask systems given the relative price points of the 2 categories, and the fact that the vast majority of mask revenue is returning customers on resupply programs. 
The resiliency of our mask and accessory resupply has been strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and we see it as remaining strong through the rotary and strong in a post-COVID Peak world. We continue to produce clinical research showing that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea saves money and improves quality-of-life for patients.
This quarter, we are now showing data that treating sleep apnea is actually a life and death decision. The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study. The high-level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality-of-life and extends quantity-of-life. It also showed the side in that not treating sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes, and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher health care costs, treating those diseases and ultimately leading to earlier death.
Let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve COPD and asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients in our core respiratory care markets, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation as well as newer areas, including pharmaceutical drug delivery and high flow therapy. We make the smallest, quietest and most comfortable devices on the market, and they are all 100% cloud connectable.
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the peak of the COVID-19 crisis there about 9 months ago. We accelerated the time-to-market to meet the needs of physicians and patients during the COVID peak, and it's proved to be very useful during the peak and beyond the peak. The value being provided through this platform has helped our health care systems in the markets they're operating in. 
In short, we are making digital health part of the standard of care for respiratory care, not just in Europe but worldwide. During the quarter, we decided to exit the portable oxygen market and shut down our concentrator business in that category. We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with stage II and stage III COPD patients. Since then, in these last 5 years, we have acquired Propeller, giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including stage I and stage II COPD patients.
Additionally and especially during COVID, we've seen more rapid adoption of high flow therapy that can support some COPD patients. And of course, we have our core noninvasive ventilation and Life Support Ventilation Solutions for more severe COPD patients in markets globally already. In short, we don't need POCs to help in our end-to-end digital health pathway for COPD.
Additionally, given no positive changes to POC reimbursement in the latest round from the U.S. government and the economics of our customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, the POC market itself is not as attractive as it was 5 years ago.
The bottom line is this. We have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in Stage I and stage II COPD, we have the emergence of high flow therapy for stage II and Stage III COPD; and we have growing use of noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in stage III and stage IV COPD. So in summary, we are very well positioned to help patients, physicians, providers and payers with an end-to-end digital health management pathway for COPD. 
Let me now review our Software as a Service business. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by a continued strong uptake of our Brightree HME resupply solutions. The impact of COVID on surgical procedures and other in-hospital and out-of-hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice. On the other hand, the flow of patients in home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well, even stronger.
So as we look across our portfolio of out-of-hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health and hospice, life plan communities, Private Duty Home Care and senior living we expect that the weighted average market growth rate of these verticals will be in the low to mid single-digit range for fiscal 2021. We expect this weighted average market growth rate portfolio to return to mid-single digits and then to high single digits as hospital discharge and ambulatory so center discharge rates return.
Our offerings are very well received in each of the verticals that we serve. So we will not just accept these market growth rates. We will look to meet and beat that group market growth rate as we did this quarter, getting a return from our significant investments in R&D within Brightree and MatrixCare. And through expansion of our partnerships with hospital-based electronic health record providers.
Brightree continues to innovate to drive resupply growth. Of particular note, the integration and scaling of the Snap technology is going very well. This has allowed our home medical equipment customers to expand their resupply programs and support more patients with better engagement at a time during the COVID pandemic when they desperately need new innovation, both the providers and the patients. 
MatrixCare has also introduced new technology. We introduced new voice to text technology at the point of care, which helps address a give us shortages, which are right during COVID by enabling better and more efficient workflows for the customer, while also delivering a better experience for the ultimate customer who's the patient.
Our expanded relationship with is progressing very well. We are now preferred solution across home health and hospice as well as home medical equipment and their pharmacy and infusion businesses. Our increasingly important relationship with is leading to better interoperability for providers, our mutual customers and an improved experience for patients. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to sleep apnea and COPD disease management with these partners over time.
Clearly, 2020 was an unprecedented year for companies across every industry, and there was much suffering around the world. However, we see some blessings during all that suffering. Importantly, we here at ResMed, we were able to be there during the emergency. We were able to pivot our whole team and our hob business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the pandemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model.
Additionally, COVID has highlighted the importance of respiratory health. COVID generally kills people through -- through acute respiratory distress syndrome. And it's awful, but that has raised the awareness of respiratory hygiene, respiratory health and the field of respiratory medicine.
The crisis also showed us the importance of digital health and has accelerated the awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, remote patient diagnosis, remote patients set up as well as remote patient monitoring and management. We have seen this crisis drive the importance of health care delivered outside the hospital. And that's where ResMed competes for more than 90% of our business. And it's where we add value customers and where we win. We have seen an ability to bring digital technology that we've been inventing and developing for over a decade, digital screening, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics and digital health management of patients.
With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies. We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond.
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians, whose perseverance hard work and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances of 2020 allowed our partners in health care to save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs ventilation, literally given the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during cohort. I also thank you for the rapid pivot back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital and preferably in their own home. Thank you.
With that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll move to Q&A. Brett?"

My remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.
As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $800 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 7%. Consistent with our prediction during the Q1 earnings call, we derived minimal incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the December quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $427 million, an increase of 5%.
Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $281 million, an increase of 17%, growing constant currency terms an increase of 10%. By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $205 million, an increase of 1%. Masks and other sales were $222 million, an increase of 8%.
In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $188 million, an increase of 16%, when constant currency terms, a 10% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $93 million, an increase of 18% or in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%.
Globally constant currency terms, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Software as a Service revenue for the second quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6%. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 5%.
During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to and deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.
Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 59.9% in the December quarter compared to 59.7% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product mix changes and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declines in average selling prices.
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $169 million, a decrease of 1%, while in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.2% compared to the 23.3% we reported in the prior year quarter.
Benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in the second half of FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.
R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to 6.8% in the prior year.
We continue to prioritize our investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solution development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in the high single digits, reflecting this commitment to innovation.
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $254 million, an increase of 16%, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margins and well contained operating expenses.
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.8%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.2%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%.
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $206 million, an increase of 17%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, also a 17% increase. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23.
During the December quarter, we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business. We recognized that restructuring expenses of $13.9 million associated with the closure. Going forward, the cessation of our POC business will have an immaterial impact on both group revenue and earnings per share. We do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future, and we have adjusted for this onetime expense within our non-GAAP results for the quarter.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $170 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $35 million, depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.
We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record losses of approximately $5 million per quarter in the second half of FY '21 associated with the joint venture operations.
We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $256 million. At December 31, we had $826 million in gross debt and $570 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At December 31, we had a further $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. 
Our solid cash flow and liquidity provide flexibility in how we allocate capital. We have focused on paying down debt as well as ensuring we have cash reserves to support the company through the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as Snap, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We intend to continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program, and we may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program having been on par since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019.
Turning now to our FY '21 outlook. At a high level, we are seeing negligible COVID-19 generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in the second half of FY '21. Note, as a reminder, we recorded $35 million in COVID-generated ventilator revenue in our March quarter last year and $125 million in COVID-generated ventilator revenue in our June quarter last year.
Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offerings. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in the second half of FY '21.
Notwithstanding continued COVID-19 challenges, we continue to expect a sequential increase in new sleep patients, which should support our device sales as we move through the second half of FY '21. However, we typically experience a small seasonal sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3, largely attributable to the reset of deductibles and health insurance plans in our U.S. market. We expect this trend will also be apparent in FY '21.
Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, including the potential disruptive impacts of ongoing restrictions imposed in many of the countries we operate in. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

And so yes, look, it does start to form a good base when you look at the core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. I mean, as we said, the seasonality, usually from Q2, December quarter to Q3, March quarter related to the U.S. market on deductibles and so on. But for the other 139 countries we're in and across the portfolio, so it's a good base to start to get that slow and steady improvement in the patient flow in this new digital health driven world, Margaret, all patients going to primary care on Zoom and telemedicine and getting referrals to their specialists and coming through the pipeline. And so we think it's better for the long term, but it is slowly and steadily coming back from that base.
And yes, as we said sort of in those numbers of the percentage flows as best we can see it. We saw improvement from September to December. And so you noted that in taking up event sales over that 90-day period as well."

It's -- we've certainly seen sort of modest sort of single-digit improvements in overall adherence as we look at the big data, and we're actually doing a whole bunch of research on is to understand the sort of kinetics and dynamics of COVID-19 on the market. I think really early stage in sort of March, April, people -- there was a lot of things going around maybe using a CPAP would bring more virus in the room if you have other being rooms, there was some fear and uncertainty and doubt in that early period. But I think that was all covered over by doctors saying, listen, if you get treated for sleep apnea, it's actually preventative in improving your lungs and lower impact and severity of COVID-19. And again, look, there's so much clinical literature out there in terms of the general press. But through the scientific data we're able to see, people are adhering. Those where adhering more and sleeping more and using the devices more.
And David, to your point, they are participating more in those resupply programs. They are seeing the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory Health. And when they get a text response or an app click and a chance to say, yes, I want that new mask, I want that new tubing, I want that humidifier. They're clicking it at much higher rates and getting closer to, frankly, what they should have always done, which is keeping respiratory hygiene at top of mind. So I would say modest improvements in overall adherence. And more significant improvements in the probability that a person says, who is at adherence says, ""I want to get that mask. With that co-pay, I want to get that mass now to get resupply."" And in cash markets, same thing as well. So it's a really good question, David, it's a complex equation, and we're working through all the variables.

And like David, it's complex because there's 140 countries all adopting digital health at different rates and all having different sort of national rules around retail and restaurants as well as how you get back to life and back to health care as well.
Health care has proved pretty resilient. I think because people know it's an essential industry. And the data that I shared earlier around truly life and death decision of using your CPAP or not for treating sleep apnea. I mean it's incredible to have those data in the hands of our physicians worldwide as they're driving adherent. It's one thing to be doing a digital telemedicine call with a patient over a Zoom or secure network, it's another one to say, listen, using this device will save your life as well as improve your quality of life.
And so the numbers are plus or minus 10% anyway. And that's why the ranges are so broad. But look, the U.S. key market is somewhere between 70% to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow as best we can measure it by Apnealink air usage by Airsense 10 sort of air solutions activations of new devices and reactivations of resupply devices.
And it's not Perfect data, and it's different in all the 50 states just in the country that I'm living in here between California or Massachusetts and Florida, very different areas of opening up of their whole economies on local and state regulations. But that range is pretty broad, but it's pretty active in terms of the patient flow through. And that's why I think you've seen people really participating in mask and accessory resupply programs, but a slowdown, obviously, of new patient starts.
And to your point about the kinetics side of it. Yes, from the September quarter, I think, we've moved up sort of somewhere between 5% and 10% in each of the key markets. I talked about, U.S., China and Germany as examples for Americas, Europe and Asia. So that's 5%, 10% -- 500 basis points plus improvement in the quarter. It's not -- there's V shape. We're back to 100% December 2019 again. But it's a slow, steady sort of new shape improvement in the flow of patients which we think does then over time, flow through with all the systems and all the restrictions in the portfolio of 140 countries through to patients getting set up and started on their lifetime of therapy on sleep apnea or COPD therapy."

But it looked like there was a pretty good strong performance, and we think the same underlying fundamentals that we've talked about, particularly in the U.S. market, we're applying a different scale on these markets.
And so in many small markets, we saw the uptake of the digital solutions being really strong. And in fact, underpin that in our own technology base, we pay a really good performance from our technology team to meeting those digital requirements in each of the different countries as well. And then there was just really sort of patient demand for making sure that treatment is up to scratch is really good. We saw those dynamics across the board. It's a whole sort of a resurgence -- didn't seem to have quite the effect that you might have thought because I think the health systems and what they actually didn't need to shut down everything in the whole system, and they knew what they could keep he's open. And so then the sort of the diagnosis processes and that kept going on.
As Mick said before, things aren't yet back to fully open and normal, but the whole system is striving to get there and additional things like uptakes in posted testing in some markets, have been supported as well. So it's really our whole suite of solutions is supporting a market that needs to treat these patients has kept us going."

And I'll take the example of the United States where it's probably a 25% government reimbursement, 75%, if you like, in our sleep PAP, but sleep apnea field of private payers. They're all very supportive of both in lab and home without a testing. If you look at this country, pre-COVID was probably 45% home sleep apnea testing, this is 55% in lab. I think that's moved up very significantly during COVID. Obviously, during the peak of the lockdowns went very high. And it will probably level out somewhere in that 50%, 55%, 60% range of the diagnosis being home sleep apnea testing.
Payers often have deltas of -- I think it can vary from $250 for [indiscernible] sleep apnea tests. And $750, $800 for an in lab test, just relative to the costs that are there. Obviously, for the payer, they would want if it's clinically equivalent patient and good sensitivity and specificity of the data and good patient outcomes and patient satisfaction as well the payers care about, they would flow towards home sleep apnea testing where they can.

And the fact of the matter is, PSG equipment is a lot more expensive to purchase, more expensive to operate. And it takes more time from both the physician and the facility. So that's what they're looking at, more so than necessarily the incentives that are driven by the lower cost of home sleep testing, and the higher reimbursement rate of PSG. We certainly support good PSG when it's appropriate for the patient. And there's a lot of sleep hubs that have invested a lot of capital and they invest a lot of time for their staff in that. And it's important that they'd be reimbursed adequately. So they both have their place in the market. But I think it's generally those sorts of things that go into their reimbursement decisions, not necessarily what outcomes they're trying to drive."

So what that allowed us to do is to get to patients much earlier in the COPD development cycle. It's really stage I COPD, where you have that shortness of breath, climbing a flight of stairs and you go to see the primary care doctor and talk about it. And they do the diagnosis and find out that you do have some lung dysfunction. And this broad category called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, you get put in that bucket. And there's many different types of therapies that the doctor can go to, but a lot of them are those pharmaceutical therapies upfront. And those inhalers are not used as prescribed when they're just given a prescription. The same is when a pill is prescribed for high cholesterol or blood pressure, the adherence rates are very low in the general population, 50% plus or minus.
And with Propeller Health, we're able to drive those adherence rates up double-digit on a relative basis and drive to incredible adherence rates that the pharma industry just hasn't seen in respiratory medicine. And so Propeller technology is really exciting. It's really new. We have major global companies partnering with us in major markets driving that. Early days, but we think that allows us to get to stage I, stage II patients in a very significant scalable way to get them on that sort of end-to-end digital health journey in COPD. As they progress to stage II, stage III, they sometimes get prescriptions for high therapy, oxygen and ventilation, right? And so we're there, with noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, which is really stage III, stage IV.
And in that sort of crossover phase from the pharmaceuticals to the ventilator, both oxygen and high therapy used. therapy is newer and more scaling, and we think more related to our core business and the core devices we make. And it allows us to treat the patients and take care of the patients. And so PSC just became an additional one that wasn't as important in that end-to-end journey and certainly didn't have the sort of margin profile or the growth profile with the changes in reimbursement to allow us to have the same growth opportunity that we have in noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation. So that's sort of it in a nutshell."

Thanks for the question, David. And yes, clearly, Brightree had strong growth driven by the strength of our home medical equipment, customers and their ability to pivot their businesses to mask and resupply and the great adoption of Brightree Resupply, sort of our core resupply software there. But also the Snap technology acquisition that we closed almost exactly a year ago, we were doing due diligence a year ago and closed it sort of later on during this March quarter.
And so those 2 technologies have been very well adopted. But look, in addition to that, our Brightree team, it's a significant double-digit percent of their revenues in R&D. They've delivered a whole bunch of innovation, some COVID-related management opportunities for their HME customers as well as other innovative ways to grow their business. And so that's allowed the Brightree business to support HMEs and really help them survive and thrive in the early stages and later stages of c00. And it's a great health to the industry, and I'm really proud that ResMed and Brightree was able to deliver that.
On the MatrixCare side, yes, it's a tougher story because their verticals that they operate in were more severely affected, skilled nursing facility, census was down high double-digit the peak of the crisis and still is down year-on-year in terms of the number of patients in skilled nursing facility operations, and that impacts MatrixCare's census rates and ability to grow. In addition, hospice affected similarly.
On the other hand, home health has been a growth light within the MatrixCare area. And the addition of our MatrixCare brand is that it's health care first, Brightree and MatrixCare technology, it's all combined under the MatrixCare brand has been growing really well. And Navin and his team who are -- the VP is driving that has seen incredible growth in home health and hospice. 
And I think if you look across that portfolio, what sort of the guide that we give, because you can go through all the verticals in detail is that we think that, that weighted average market growth rate is mid- to -- low to mid-single digits right now. You saw we grew 6% in the quarter. So we're growing a little bit ahead of market, taking a little some of those verticals.
But as the weighted average market growth rate goes to mid-single digits, we're going to look to meet and beat that. And then when it gets back to high single digits, as the flow of patients from hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers picks up, we will then see skilled nursing facilities, hospice and all the verticals pick up their census rates and get us back to those sort of growth rates and beyond over time. So David, it's really sort of related to the whole recovery of the economy that really related to the hospital, what people are calling elective surgeries. And I think if you need a heart valve or a new hit. It's hardly elective when the pain or the probability of death starts going up. And I think health care systems are really starting to address that and get their patients back into care, so we should start to see those recoveries over time."

But especially in the U.S. market, reimbursement has always been upside down, sort of unfavorable to POCs versus stationary. And we entered the category knowing that and we're innovating it. We actually feel really good about the products we had been developing a product and of market and the next-generation that we were developing. But then you see how reimbursement has not changed, and in fact, has become less favorable. In relative terms, the category is just not that attractive, right? That doesn't have the same growth that it had 5 years ago when we entered as a category, and that sort of thing.
And then when you take that line of business and compare it to our overall portfolio in the Sleep & Respiratory Care business, in relative terms, it's not nearly as strong a profile as the other opportunities we have to invest in innovation, right? So we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to invest in Propeller Health, a fantastic opportunity. It's early days but a fantastic opportunity to invest in high flow there, which we think has a really interesting clinical profile and could be of great benefit to patients. And then, of course, as we continue to grow our digital offerings, our R&D portfolio, there's just plenty of places for us to put R&D into other digital offerings and the expansion of our digital offerings. 
And so -- it's a question of looking at the market and where that category had evolved since we've entered with that acquisition, but also just looking at the range of opportunities we have in hand, and making a decision to invest in things that we think are Ford more attractive, both for ResMed shareholders and also for patients."

Obviously, we're further down the road on Propeller Health, and it's starting to move in the Stage I, stage II area. During COVID-19, there were uses of high-flow therapy for patients with low oxygen. And it's always been an area that has been looked at. What we're interested in ResMed, 90% of our revenues are in the home. We're really interested in Home Care. And the idea of high-flow therapy in the home, we think, has a lot of future. There's not a lot of reimbursement, in fact, virtually 0 anywhere around the world. So it's a new development area. But we think given some of the clinical data that are coming out, and some of the research we're doing with providers around the world, there is an opportunity to get patients out of the hospital and into the home with high-flow therapy treatment.
As a stepping stone and a pathway to our noninvasive ventilators and life support ventilators and in combination with our drug delivery systems. So it's very early days, Chris, not at all material to our business, but it -- provides that sort of bridge portfolio, if you like, from Propeller through to the ventilation side. And we think was validated somewhat during COVID-19 and some clinical data that we are working with people with around the world says that. As we look towards 2025, we think this will be a good part of our home care portfolio of taking care of patients with high-flow therapy."

But it was when we started to see models in the U.S. and France and Japan and now Germany, where digital health started to be reimbursed because it is providing care that is of value and then reflecting that for the doctors and the providers and reimbursing in that.
So I think reimbursement is a very important part of developing the home care market for high-flow therapy. So obviously, our research and partnerships with payers, providers and IDNs will be along those lines."

On mask replacement, I think what we've seen all year during the pandemic is a couple of -- we've talked about this, I think, on this call before, we've seen a couple of dynamics. The first one is, I do think patients are just more attentive to the idea that their equipment might be older. I think there's a greater sensitivity and awareness on behalf of patients to sort of have clean and disinfected reading apparatus, right? I mean -- so I think that's driven a bit of incremental demand, and it's an open question as to how persistent that will be. But I would think it's going to be a bit more persistent. I think you'll see patients just more attentive to cleaning their masks and the tubes and we supply on a regular cadence. But that's speculation. We've certainly seen it this year. I don't know how long that will continue or if it will increase and so on.
I think the other thing that, of course, has been happening is in the markets where resupply is a benefit, which is largely the U.S. market or other markets where it is for the provider. But in the U.S. market, I think HME customers have been, if anything, more focused on driving the supply as a part of their business to patients. And so that's been a marriage of 2 trends, where the HME wants to pay attention to be supplying as new patient starts have been slower and the patient wants the equipment. And I think that behind that, in addition, behind that, we've had increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms, including our offerings there. So I think all 3 of those trends have led to higher resupply overall. And I think it probably will persist, but it's very difficult to predict as all things go"

On this, our first call for calendar year 2021, we are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly, we all want to see faster production and wider distribution so that people can be safe from COVID-19 and free to open up their communities and free to get back to their lives. We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians as well as providers, patients and ResMedians around the 140-plus countries that we operate in.
In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD and asthma are steadily increasing, modestly improving on the trends we saw in the September 2020 quarter. We're seeing this improvement of patient flow even as second and third waves come through Northern Winter Hemisphere nations because physicians and providers are adopting digital health, which enables patient engagement, even when people cannot or do not want to meet live and in person.
In my remarks today, I will provide a high-level overview of our December Q2 FY '21 business results and then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on the financials. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities.
Today, we have published and reported solid high single-digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results once again speak to our ResMed team's ability to work innovatively and deliver results even when facing lower patient activity and little-to-no incremental benefit from ventilator sales.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders. We have also grown research and development investments in digital health technology as well as hardware, software and clinical research. We forecast increasing digital health demand from patients, from physicians, from providers and from health care systems as they embrace remote patient monitoring and they adopt data-driven population health management systems.
We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers, with an industry-leading IP portfolio, including over the 6,000 patents and designs.
Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences and to drive lower health care system costs.
We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions Platform. We have sold over 13.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed, and we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud.
With these data liberated to the cloud, we can unlock value for all of our customer groups. We can unlock value for patients through myAir, we can unlock value for physicians through AirView and we can unlock value for IDNs, payer providers as well as private and government insurers for data-driven population health management. That's the future of health care.
The goals we share with all of our customers are these three: one, to improve patient outcomes, patient quality of life, patient chronic disease outcomes; two, to lower overall health care system costs; and three, to bend the curve of chronic disease progression. To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look out here at ResMed are, of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type 2 diabetes, with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond.
During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID has continued to accelerate the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world. We are seeing the recognition of the value of remote patient screening, virtual diagnosis, remote patient management and a rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models in many of the nations that we serve patients.
As an example of just one of these, Germany, during the quarter, approved reimbursement for mandibular repositioning device, including our digital 3D printed dental sleep apnea, product called Narval. This is the first time Germany has approved such a product type to treat sleep apnea. In addition, several German states are looking at and experimenting with digital health reimbursement models. These are exciting developments, and we expect this will benefit our German business over time.
We have also seen other national governments, including France, Japan and the United States where they've adopted models and taken action to accelerate digital health adoption.
Remote health care is of incredible importance during this COVID-19 pandemic, but digital health is also valuable well beyond the impact of COVID because it provides better availability of health care, it provides excellent quality care for patients, and it provides significantly lower costs for health care systems worldwide. These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy. We believe the accelerated adoption of digital health solutions represents a significant and permanent shift of the adoption curve for ResMed's market-leading digital health solutions.
Let me now briefly update you on our top 3 strategic priorities. These 3 priorities are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home.
In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends as well as very strong resupply activity, both of which have supported another quarter of solid revenue growth that you can see in the numbers we just released. We're seeing 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States, and to take an example of a European country, in Germany, we're already back to 85% to 90-plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow.
Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70-plus percent, 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market. Obviously, the recovery rates of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy may be impacted by the typical seasonality we see in our largest market here in the United States in the March quarter, as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of the calendar year. This is as per normal.
This seasonal impact affects devices more than it affects mask systems given the relative price points of the 2 categories, and the fact that the vast majority of mask revenue is returning customers on resupply programs. The resiliency of our mask and accessory resupply has been strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and we see it as remaining strong through the rotary and strong in a post-COVID peak world. We continue to produce clinical research showing that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea saves money and improves quality of life for patients.
This quarter, we are now showing data that treating sleep apnea is actually a life and death decision. The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study. The high-level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality of life and extends quantity of life. It also showed the converse side in that not treating sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher health care costs treating those diseases and ultimately leading to earlier death.
Let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve COPD and asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients in our core respiratory care markets, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation as well as newer areas, including pharmaceutical drug delivery and high flow therapy. We make the smallest, quietest and most comfortable devices on the market, and they are all 100% cloud connectable.
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the peak of the COVID-19 crisis there about 9 months ago. We accelerated the time-to-market to meet the needs of physicians and patients during the COVID peak and it's proved to be very useful during the peak and beyond the peak. The value being provided through this platform has helped health care systems in the markets they're operating in.
In short, we are making digital health part of the standard of care for respiratory care, not just in Europe but worldwide. During the quarter, we decided to exit the portable oxygen market and shut down our concentrator business in that category. We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with stage II and stage III COPD patients. Since then, in these last 5 years, we have acquired Propeller, giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including stage I and stage II COPD patients.
Additionally and especially during COVID, we've seen more rapid adoption of high flow therapy that can support some COPD patients. And of course, we have our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for more severe COPD patients in markets globally already. In short, we don't need POCs to help in our end-to-end digital health pathway for COPD.
Additionally, given no positive changes to POC reimbursement in the latest round from the U.S. government and the economics of our customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, the POC market itself is not as attractive as it was 5 years ago.
The bottom line is this. We have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in stage I and stage II COPD, we have the emergence of high flow therapy for stage II and stage III COPD and we have growing use of noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in stage III and stage IV COPD.
So in summary, we are very well positioned to help patients, physicians, providers and payers with an end-to-end digital health management pathway for COPD.
Let me now review our Software as a Service business. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by a continued strong uptake of our Brightree HME resupply solutions. The impact of COVID on surgical procedures and other in-hospital and out-of-hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice. On the other hand, the flow of patients in-home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well, even stronger.
So as we look across our portfolio of out-of-hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health and hospice, life plan communities, private duty home care and senior living, we expect that the weighted average market growth rate of these verticals will be in the low to mid single-digit range for fiscal 2021. We expect this weighted average market growth rate portfolio to return to mid-single digits and then to high single digits as hospital discharge and ambulatory surgery center discharge rates return.
Our offerings are very well received in each of the verticals that we serve. So we will not just accept these market growth rates, we will look to meet and beat that group market growth rate as we did this quarter, getting a return from our significant investments in R&D within Brightree and MatrixCare. And through expansion of our partnerships with hospital-based electronic health record providers.
Brightree continues to innovate to drive resupply growth. Of particular note, the integration and scaling of the Snap technology is going very well. This has allowed our home medical equipment customers to expand their resupply programs and support more patients with better engagement at a time during the COVID pandemic when they desperately need new innovation, both the providers and the patients.
MatrixCare has also introduced new technology. We introduced new voice to text technology at the point of care, which helps address caregiver shortages, which are right during COVID by enabling better and more efficient workflows for the customer, while also delivering a better experience for the ultimate customer who's the patient.
Our expanded relationship with Cerner is progressing very well. We are now Cerner's preferred solution across home health and hospice as well as home medical equipment and their pharmacy and infusion businesses. Our increasingly important relationship with Cerner is leading to better interoperability for providers, our mutual customers and an improved experience for patients. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to sleep apnea and COPD disease management with these partners over time.
Clearly, 2020 was an unprecedented year for companies across every industry, and there was much suffering around the world. However, we see some blessings during all that suffering. Importantly, we here at ResMed, we were able to be there during the emergency. We were able to pivot our whole team and our HOT business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the pandemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model.
Additionally, COVID has highlighted the importance of respiratory health. COVID generally kills people through acute respiratory distress syndrome. And it's awful, but that has raised the awareness of respiratory hygiene, respiratory health and the field of respiratory medicine. The crisis also showed us the importance of digital health and has accelerated the awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, remote patient diagnosis, remote patients set up as well as remote patient monitoring and management.
We have seen this crisis drive the importance of health care delivered outside the hospital. And that's where ResMed competes for more than 90% of our business. And it's where we add value to customers and where we win. We have seen an ability to bring digital technology that we've been inventing and developing for over a decade, digital screening, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics and digital health management of patients.
With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies. We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond.
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians, whose perseverance, hard work and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances of 2020 allowed our partners in health care to save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency need for ventilation, literally given the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during COVID. I also thank you for the rapid pivot back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital and preferably in their own home. Thank you.
With that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll move to Q&A. Brett?"

My remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.As Mick noted, we",1305,"Great. Thanks, Mick. My remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.
As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $800 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 7%. Consistent with our prediction during the Q1 earnings call, we derived minimal incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the December quarter.
Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $427 million, an increase of 5%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $281 million, an increase of 17%, growing constant currency terms an increase of 10%.
By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $205 million, an increase of 1%. Masks and other sales were $222 million, an increase of 8%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $188 million, an increase of 16% or in constant currency terms, a 10% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $93 million, an increase of 18% or in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%.
Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Software as a Service revenue for the second quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6%. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 5%.
During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.
Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 59.9% in the December quarter compared to 59.7% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product mix changes and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declines in average selling prices.
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $169 million, a decrease of 1% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.2% compared to the 23.3% we reported in the prior year quarter. Benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in the second half of FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.
R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to 6.8% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize our investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solution development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in the high single digits, reflecting this commitment to innovation.
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $254 million, an increase of 16%, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margins and well contained operating expenses.
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.8%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.2%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%.
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $206 million, an increase of 17%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, also a 17% increase. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23.
During the December quarter, we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business. We recognized that restructuring expenses of $13.9 million associated with the closure. Going forward, the cessation of our POC business will have an immaterial impact on both group revenue and earnings per share. We do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future, and we have adjusted for this onetime expense within our non-GAAP results for the quarter.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $170 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $35 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividend of $57 million.
We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $5 million per quarter in the second half of FY '21 associated with the joint venture operations.
We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $256 million. At December 31, we had $826 million in gross debt and $570 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At December 31, we had a further $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.
Our solid cash flow and liquidity provide flexibility in how we allocate capital. We have focused on paying down debt as well as ensuring we have cash reserves to support the company through the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as Snap, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We intend to continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program, and we may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program having been on par since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019.
Turning now to our FY '21 outlook. At a high level, we are seeing negligible COVID-19 generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in the second half of FY '21. Note, as a reminder, we recorded $35 million in COVID-generated ventilator revenue in our March quarter last year and $125 million in COVID-generated ventilator revenue in our June quarter last year.
Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offerings. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in the second half of FY '21.
Notwithstanding continued COVID-19 challenges, we continue to expect a sequential increase in new sleep patients, which should support our device sales as we move through the second half of FY '21. However, we typically experience a small seasonal sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3, largely attributable to the reset of deductibles in health insurance plans in our U.S. market. We expect this trend will also be apparent in FY '21.
Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, including the potential disruptive impacts of ongoing restrictions imposed in many of the countries we operate in. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

And so yes, look, it does start to form a good base when you look at the core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. I mean, as we said, the seasonality, usually from Q2, December quarter, to Q3, March quarter, related to the U.S. market on deductibles and so on. But for the other 139 countries we're in and across the portfolio, it's a good base to start to get that slow and steady improvement in the patient flow in this new digital health driven world, Margaret, all patients going to primary care on Zoom and telemedicine and getting referrals to their specialists and coming through the pipeline. And so we think it's better for the long term, but it is slowly and steadily coming back from that base.
And yes, as we said sort of in those numbers of the percentage flow patient as best we can see it, we saw improvement from September to December. And so you noted that in taking up vent sales over that 90-day period as well."

It's interesting. It's -- we've certainly seen sort of modest sort of single-digit improvements in overall adherence as we look at the big data, and we're actually doing a whole bunch of research on is to understand the sort of kinetics and dynamics of COVID-19 on the market. I think really early stage in sort of March, April, people -- there was a lot of things going around maybe using a CPAP would bring more virus in the room if you have other people in the room, there was some fear and uncertainty and doubt in that early period. But I think that was all covered over by doctors saying, listen, if you get treated for sleep apnea, it's actually preventative in improving your lungs and lower impact and severity of COVID-19. And again, look, there's so much clinical literature out there in terms of the general press. But through the scientific data we're able to see, people are adhering. Those who are adhering are adhering more and sleeping more and using the devices more.
And David, to your point, they are participating more in those resupply programs. They are seeing the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. And when they get a text response or an app click and a chance to say, yes, I want that new mask, I want that new tubing, I want that new humidifier. They're clicking it at much higher rates and getting closer to, frankly, what they should have always done, which is keeping respiratory hygiene at top of mind.
So I would say modest improvements in overall adherence. And more significant improvements in the probability that a person says, who is at adherence says, ""I want to get that mask. With that co-pay, I want to get that mask now to get resupply."" And in cash markets, same thing as well. So it's a really good question, David, it's a complex equation, and we're working through all the variables. But yes, modest improvement in adherence and really good improvement in mask resupplies, as you saw in the numbers as well as you saw in the health of the patients."

And like David, it's complex because there's 140 countries all adopting digital health at different rates and all having different sort of national rules around retail and restaurants as well as how you get back to life and back to health care as well.
Health care has proved pretty resilient. I think because people know it's an essential industry. And the data that I shared earlier around truly life and death decision of using a CPAP or not for treating sleep apnea, I mean it's incredible to have those data in the hands of our physicians worldwide as they're driving adherence. It's one thing to be doing a digital telemedicine call with a patient over a Zoom or secure network, it's another one to say, listen, using this device will save your life as well as improve your quality of life.
And so the numbers are plus or minus 10% anyway. And that's why the ranges are so broad. But look, the U.S. key market is somewhere between 70% to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow as best we can measure it by ApneaLink Air usage by AirSense 10 sort of air solutions activations of new devices and reactivations of resupply devices.
And it's not perfect data, and it's different in all the 50 states just in the country that I'm living in here between California or Massachusetts and Florida, very different areas of opening up of their whole economies on local and state regulations. But that range is pretty broad, but it's pretty accurate in terms of the patient flow through. And that's why I think you've seen people really participating in mask and accessory resupply programs, but a slowdown, obviously, of new patient starts.
And to your point about the kinetics side of it. Yes, from the September quarter, I think, we've moved up sort of somewhere between 5% and 10% in each of the key markets. I talked about, U.S., China and Germany as examples for Americas, Europe and Asia. So that's 5%, 10% -- 500 basis points plus improvement in the quarter. It's not -- there's a V shape. We're back to 100% December 2019 again. But it's a slow, steady sort of new shape improvement in the flow of patients which we think does then over time, flow through with all the systems and all the restrictions in the portfolio of 140 countries through to patients getting set up and started on their lifetime of therapy on sleep apnea or COPD therapy."

But across the board, really interesting, we sort of had strong performance in many, many countries. Usually, the countries are vary and some are strong and some aren't so on a given time. But it looked like there was a pretty good strong performance, and we think the same underlying fundamentals that we've talked about, particularly in the U.S. market, we're applying a different scale on these markets.
And so in many small markets, we saw the uptake of the digital solutions being really strong. And in fact, underpinning that in our own technology base, we had a really good performance from our technology team to meeting those digital requirements in each of the different countries as well. And then there was just really sort of patient demand for making sure that treatment is up to scratch is really good. We saw those dynamics across the board. It's a whole sort of a resurgence -- didn't seem to have quite the effect that you might have thought because I think the health systems and what they actually didn't need to shut down everything in the health system, and they knew what they could keep open. And so then the sort of the diagnosis processes and that kept going on.
As Mick said before, things aren't yet back to fully open and normal, but the whole system is striving to get there and additional things like uptakes in home sleep testing in some markets have been supported as well. So it's really our whole suite of solutions is supporting a market that needs to treat these patients has kept us going."

And I'll take the example of the United States where it's probably a 25% government reimbursement, 75%, if you like, in our sleep apnea field of private payers.

I think that's moved up very significantly during COVID. Obviously, during the peak of the lockdowns, it went very high. And it will probably level out somewhere in that 50%, 55%, 60% range of the diagnosis being home sleep apnea testing.
Payers often have deltas of -- I think it can vary from $250 for home sleep apnea tests. And $750, $800 for an in-lab test, just relative to the costs there. Obviously, for the payer, they would want if it's clinically equivalent patient and good sensitivity and specificity of the data and good patient outcomes and patient satisfaction as well the payers care about, they would flow towards home sleep apnea testing where they can.

And the fact of the matter is, PSG equipment is a lot more expensive to purchase, more expensive to operate. And it takes more time from both the physician and the facility. So that's what they're looking at, more so than necessarily the incentives that are driven by the lower cost of home sleep testing, and the higher reimbursement rate of PSG. We certainly support good PSG when it's appropriate for the patient. And there's a lot of sleep hubs that have invested a lot of capital and they invest a lot of time for their staff in that. And it's important that they'd be reimbursed adequately. So they both have their place in the market. But I think it's generally those sorts of things that go into their reimbursement decisions, not necessarily what outcomes they're trying to drive."

So what that allowed us to do is to get to patients much earlier in the COPD development cycle. It's really stage I COPD, where you have that shortness of breath, climbing a flight of stairs and you go to see the primary care doctor and talk about it. And they do the diagnosis and find out that you do have some lung dysfunction. And this broad category called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, you get put in that bucket. And there's many different types of therapies that the doctor can go to, but a lot of them are those pharmaceutical therapies upfront. And those inhalers are not used as prescribed when they're just given a prescription. The same is when a pill is prescribed for high cholesterol or blood pressure, the adherence rates are very low in the general population, 50% plus or minus.
And with Propeller Health, we're able to drive those adherence rates up double digits on a relative basis and drive to incredible adherence rates that the pharma industry just hasn't seen in respiratory medicine. And so Propeller technology is really exciting. It's really new. We have major global pharmaceutical companies partnering with us in major markets driving that. Early days, but we think that allows us to get to stage I, stage II patients in a very significant scalable way to get them on that sort of end-to-end digital health journey in COPD. As they progress to stage II, stage III, they sometimes get prescriptions for high-flow therapy, oxygen and ventilation, right? And so we're there, with noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, which is really stage III, stage IV.
And in that sort of crossover phase from the pharmaceuticals to the ventilator, both oxygen and high-flow therapy are used. High-flow therapy is newer and more scaling, and we think more related to our core business and the core devices we make. And it allows us to treat the patients and take care of the patients. And so POC just became an additional one that wasn't as important in that end-to-end journey and certainly didn't have the sort of margin profile or the growth profile with the changes in reimbursement to allow us to have the same growth opportunity that we have in noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation. So that's sort of it in a nutshell."

Thanks for the question, David. And yes, clearly, Brightree had strong growth driven by the strength of our home medical equipment customers and their ability to pivot their businesses to mask and resupply and the great adoption of Brightree resupply sort of our core resupply software there. But also the Snap technology acquisition that we closed almost exactly a year ago, we were doing due diligence a year ago and closed it sort of later on during this March quarter.
And so those 2 technologies have been very well adopted. But look, in addition to that, our Brightree team, it's a significant double-digit percent of their revenues in R&D. They've delivered a whole bunch of innovation, some COVID-related management opportunities for their HME customers as well as other innovative ways to grow their business. And so that's allowed the Brightree business to support HMEs and really help them survive and thrive in the early stages and later stages of COVID-19. And it's a great health to the industry, and I'm really proud that ResMed and Brightree was able to deliver that.
On the MatrixCare side, yes, it's a tougher story because their verticals that they operate in were more severely affected, skilled nursing facility, census was down high double-digit the peak of the crisis and still is down year-on-year in terms of the number of patients in skilled nursing facility operations, and that impacts MatrixCare's census rates and ability to grow. In addition, hospice affected similarly.
On the other hand, home health has been a growth light within the MatrixCare area. And the addition of our MatrixCare brand is that it's health care first Brightree and MatrixCare technology, it's all combined under the MatrixCare brand has been growing really well. And Navin and his team who are -- the VP is driving that has seen incredible growth in home health and hospice.
And I think if you look across that portfolio, what sort of the guide that we give, because you can go through all the verticals in detail is that we think that, that weighted average market growth rate is mid- to -- low to mid-single digits right now. You saw we grew 6% in the quarter. So we're growing a little bit ahead of market, taking a little -- some of those verticals.
But as the weighted average market growth rate goes to mid-single digits, we're going to look to meet and beat that. And then when it gets back to high single digits, as the flow of patients from hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers picks up, we will then see skilled nursing facilities, hospice and all the verticals pick up their census rates and get us back to those sort of growth rates and beyond over time.
So David, it's really sort of related to the whole recovery of the economy and that really related to the hospital, what people are calling elective surgeries. And I think if you need a heart valve or a new hit, it's hardly elective when the pain or the probability of death starts going up. And I think health care systems are really starting to address that and get their patients back into care, so we should start to see those recoveries over time."

I think, Mike, for balancing sort of market versus our portfolio is the way I would frame it. I think it's a little bit of both. So if you look at the market, we thought for a long time the POCs should be reimbursed in a better way, in a differential way because they create a lot of value for patients, they allow patients to be mobile and to get out their valve, which is actually better for the care. But especially in the U.S. market, reimbursement has always been upside down, sort of unfavorable to POCs versus stationary. And we entered the category knowing that and we're innovating it. We actually feel really good about the products we had been developing a product, we had a market and the next-generation that we were developing. But then you see how reimbursement has not changed, and in fact, has become less favorable. And in relative terms, the category is just not that attractive, right? That doesn't have the same growth that it had 5 years ago when we entered as a category, and that sort of thing.
And then when you take that line of business and compare it to our overall portfolio in the sleep and respiratory care business, in relative terms, it's not nearly as strong a profile as the other opportunities we have to invest in innovation, right? So we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to invest in Propeller Health, a fantastic opportunity. It's early days but a fantastic opportunity to invest in high-flow therapy, which we think has a really interesting clinical profile and could be of great benefit to patients. And then, of course, as we continue to grow our digital offerings, our R&D portfolio, there's just plenty of places for us to put R&D into other digital offerings and the expansion of our digital offerings.
And so -- it's a question of looking at the market and where that category had evolved since we've entered with that acquisition, but also just looking at the range of opportunities we have in hand, and making a decision to invest in things that we think are forward more attractive, both for ResMed shareholders and also for patients."

Obviously, we're further down the road on Propeller Health, and it's starting to move in the stage I, stage II area. During COVID-19, there were uses of high-flow therapy for patients with low oxygen. And it's always been an area that has been looked at. What we're interested in ResMed, 90% of our revenues are in the home. We're really interested in home care. And the idea of high-flow therapy in the home, we think, has a lot of future. There's not a lot of reimbursement, in fact, virtually 0 anywhere around the world. So it's a new development area. But we think given some of the clinical data that are coming out, and some of the research we're doing with providers around the world, there is an opportunity to get patients out of the hospital and into the home with high-flow therapy treatment.
As a stepping stone and a pathway to our noninvasive ventilators and life support ventilators and in combination with our drug delivery systems. So it's very early days, Chris, not at all material to our business, but it -- provides that sort of bridge portfolio, if you like, from Propeller through to the ventilation side. And we think was validated somewhat during COVID-19 and some clinical data that we are working with people with around the world says that. As we look towards 2025, we think this will be a good part of our home care portfolio of taking care of patients with high-flow therapy."

On mask replacement, I think what we've seen all year during the pandemic is a couple of -- we've talked about this, I think, on this call before, we've seen a couple of dynamics. The first one is, I do think patients are just more attentive to the idea that their equipment might be older. I think there's a greater sensitivity and awareness on behalf of patients to sort of have clean and disinfected breathing apparatus, right? I mean -- so I think that's driven a bit of incremental demand, and it's an open question as to how persistent that will be. But I would think it's going to be a bit more persistent. I think you'll see patients just more attentive to cleaning their masks and their tubes and resupply on a regular cadence. But that's speculation. We've certainly seen it this year. I don't know how long that will continue or if it will increase and so on.
I think the other thing that, of course, has been happening is in the markets where resupply is a benefit, which is largely the U.S. market or other markets where it is for the provider. But in the U.S. market, I think HME customers have been, if anything, more focused on driving the supply as a part of their business to patients. And so that's been a marriage of 2 trends, where the HME wants to pay attention to be supplying as new patient starts have been slower and the patient wants the equipment. And I think that behind that -- in addition, behind that, we've had increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms, including our offerings there. So I think all 3 of those trends have led to higher resupply overall. And I think it probably will persist, but it's very difficult to predict as all things go."

On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q3 business metrics, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. I will review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and our annual operating priorities. 
A year ago today, when we discussed our March 2020 results, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of our business, particularly in the United States, had not yet been significantly impacted. However, outside the U.S., countries including China and Italy, we're already in the midst of emergency needs. 
We quickly mobilized our supply chain and global operations to address and support ventilation needs worldwide, producing over 150,000 ventilators. We accelerated the production and distribution of noninvasive and life support ventilators and mass systems to those in need, resulting in an incremental $35 million of COVID-related revenue during the March 2020 quarter. I'm incredibly proud of how we quickly pivoted our business to meet that need, providing life-saving solutions around the world so that health care systems were prepared with the resources needed to treat patients who are fighting COVID-19. 
Today, one year later, the countries we operate in are at various different stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of getting to normal patient flow. We see a range of -- from 70% of pre-COVID patient flow in some countries, up to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow in other countries. 
Vaccines are steadily rolling out in the United States, The U.K. and many other countries worldwide. We still see significant impact from ongoing second, third and fourth waves infection in some countries in Europe as well as in South America and Asia, and especially right now in the Brazil and in particularly India. Our team is working with hospitals and health care providers in those 2 countries and beyond for preservation of life, making sure that they have ventilators, masks and the training that they need to use them. 
We continue to support the frontline respiratory therapists and the physicians who are there on the ground as well as providers, patients and ResMedians throughout their 140-plus countries that we operate in. 
We're pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in getting new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients diagnosed. Excluding the $35 million of COVID-related ventilator sales in the March 2020 quarter, our team delivered positive sales growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business this quarter on both the headline and constant currency basis. 
We forecast a steady improvement trend of patient flow for sleep apnea and COPD and asthma continuing as we move through 2021 and into 2022. We expect this progress to accelerate as COVID vaccination rates continue. We are encouraged to see that patients, physicians and providers around the world are adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, home-based testing, remote patient monitoring and ongoing patient management. 
I'd like to be clear that the ventilation sales that we made in 2020 will be part of our comparables for the next 2 quarters. In the June 2020 quarter, we recognized $125 million in COVID-related ventilator sales. And in September 2020 quarter, we recognized $40 million in such revenue. 
Over the coming quarters, we expect to continue to show strong positive year-over-year revenue growth, excluding these onetime sales from 2020. As we look further forward, we see a clear path to double-digit revenue growth in the back half of our fiscal year 2022 across our full business, powered by opening economies and our pipeline of new technology and innovation. 
Our headline results were impacted this quarter by an accounting reserve we took in connection with discussions with the Australian Tax Office, or ATO, regarding their ongoing audit dating back to fiscal year 2009. Brett has been leading those discussions and will speak to the details in his remarks. 
I will make this statement, ResMed pays significant taxes in countries around the world, and we operate in over 140 countries, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives well away from the hospital. Brett and his team are working towards a final resolution of these transfer pricing discussions dating back over 12 years with the ATO so we have taken this $255 million reserve. We believe that resolving these discussions is the pragmatic thing to do for all of our stakeholders so that we can put this behind us and focus all of our efforts on our core mission of improving lives in respiratory medicine around the world. 
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $196 million in operating cash, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders. We also increased our R&D investments in the period in digital health technology as well as R&D for hardware, embedded software and clinical research while maintaining financial discipline with reduced SG&A and other operating costs. 
We have seen increased demand for our digital health solutions from patients, physicians, providers and health care systems around the world as they embrace remote patient engagement and adopt population health management. We are the clear leader in this field with over 14 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. And our ongoing and increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure we provide superior value to patients, physicians and providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We fight for it every day through innovation. 
Our digital technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value, with an industry-leading IP portfolio, including over 8,000 patents and designs. We now have over 8.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 15.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution. And we also have over 105 million patients managed within our Software as a Service network for out-of-hospital health care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customers, patients, physicians, providers as well as private and government payers. 
Let me take a few minutes to share some recent clinical highlights that show how we are working with researchers to advance the field of sleep and respiratory medicine with these data and beyond. 
During 2020, an important 30-year duration study was published in the European Respiratory Journal, following over 4,500 diagnosed OSA patients to better understand the long-term impacts of untreated sleep apnea. 
The study showed that untreated sleep apnea leads to high incidents of myocardial infarction or heart attack, high incidence and prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and high incidence of ischemic heart disease. This real-world clinical analysis is showing that what we've known for over 3 decades. Sleep apnea is a public health epidemic that simply can't be ignored. 
In terms of clinical quality of life improvement from CPAP therapy, the data are also clear. In late 2019, the multicenter randomized controlled trial called Merge, was published in the journal, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The results were that patients randomized to CPAP demonstrated clear improvement in quality of life for CPAP patients versus standard of care with symptomatic benefits, including reductions in sleepiness as well as improvements in fatigue and importantly, depression, a key part of mental health. Importantly, these results were evident in both mild as well as moderate and severe sleep apnea. 
In terms of economic data and a dose response relationship from CPAP therapy, the data are also unequivocal. In 2019, a study was published in the journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, showing a quantified dose response relationship from CPAP therapy. So for every additional hour of positive pressure use, there was an 8% decrease in hospital inpatient visits and a 4% decrease in overall physician visits. 
In other words, treating sleep apnea with our CPAP copy not only improves lives, it also saves money for the health care system by lowering total health care utilization costs. 
During the quarter, we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the agency for healthcare, research and quality, or AHRQ, here in the U.S. market. AHRQ sort input and ResMed filed public comments, along with comments from many physician groups, sleep apnea patient advocates, provider groups and beyond. 
I won't repeat all the details of those public comments, but I will say this, we presented peer-reviewed and published data showing that CPAP therapy improves quality of life, reduces health care costs and even reduces mortality. In short, these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market, we are saving lives and saving money for the health care system through our medical technology. 
We have peer-reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack, a reduction in hypertension as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors. All of these are logical scale of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with CPAP therapy in treated sleep apnea patients. 
We are encouraged by technical studies completed by the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness, the acronym is NICE in the U.K. Just last month, NICE made public their 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that CPAP therapy, along with telemonitoring, is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild OSA. That would be an expansion of coverage in the U.K. and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market. 
Similarly, the Ministries of Health in France, Germany and Japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in this space. It's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as governments improvement in outcomes and reductions in total health care system costs technology. 
While we respect the work of AHRQ, we, along with many other academic research-focused institutes and practicing physician groups, believe that they bypassed a generation of data in real-world evidence that needs to be taken into account, along with their own select group of RCTs in the draft report. We are optimistic that the final report when issued, will reflect the preponderance of real-world evidence and broader RCTs, showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive AirView pressure. 
Okay. Let me now update you on our top 3 ResMed strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably, in a person's time. In 
our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night. The rate of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy in the U.S. was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the March quarter, primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year. This seasonal impact affects devices more than mass systems, given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the 2 categories. 
We expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality. We continue to see strong ongoing mask and accessory resupply in the U.S. market and beyond. 
New patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent COVID-related case surges in select countries in Asia and Europe, including 2 large markets, France and Germany. We see that impact the number of patients going for clinic-based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries. We expect to see these markets reopen, along with hospitals, as vaccines continue to roll out and as we see further scaling of the remote home-based diagnostic capacity. 
Clearly, the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control. However, we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners, which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes. 
More broadly, we are seeing growth in total -- total new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. And we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter. Importantly, our market-leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices, and we're excited about our future pipeline. 
We really talk about our future pipeline as those who followed us for a period of time know. But today, I would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next-generation sleep apnea platform. 
You may have seen some recent U.S. regulatory filings that we made for our next-generation flow generator platform called the AirSense 11. Clearly, there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step, but we are making good progress. 
Earlier this month, we started a limited controlled product launch of the AirSense 11 in certain parts of the United States. We expect to move to a broader commercial launch of the platform later this calendar year in the U.S. and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that. 
For now, I can say that as a personal user of our CPAP therapy, I have firsthand knowledge that the AirSense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners. And our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians, providers, payers and beyond and ultimately continue to catalyze ResMed's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for COPD, asthma and other key chronic diseases. 
We make the smallest, quietest, smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. Importantly, they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence, improve clinical outcomes and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers' own health care systems. 
Let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory Care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD or chronic constructive pulmonary disease patients and the 340 million asthma efficient worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions, including both noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drug delivery devices and high flow therapy devices. 
Our respiratory care business benefited in the March 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilated devices and ventilation mass solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic. 
During the March 2021 quarter, COVID-related ventilator sales were not material to the global business. However, we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest COVID surges such as just this month with a surge in India. We're getting many thousands of devices to those in need the demand is there in that country. 
But as in Q3, we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business even though the broader impact, particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless and incredibly important to not only our local team in India, but to all of us here at ResMed worldwide. 
Demand for our core noninvasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea. We are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs. 
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago. We are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world. The value being provided through this cloud-based software solution has been fruitful not only during the COVID pandemic and the peak part of the crisis, but it's also valuable on an ongoing value basis for physicians as well as the health care systems they operate in. We are hoping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care. 
Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets. The verticals include home medical equipment, or HME, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, senior living and life plan communities. 
Our HME customers are leveraging our advanced resupply solutions, including snap technology and Brightree resupply for our existing portfolio of patients. And they are contributing to ongoing growth as the flow of new patients in HME continues to recover steadily period by period. 
Over the past 12 months, COVID-19 has had a dampening effect on elective and emergent procedures at hospitals, as we all know, and that has slowed hospital discharge rates affecting patient flow and ultimately, the census right at skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and beyond. 
As the rate of vaccinations accelerate across the U.S. and the number of COVID-19 cases continues to trend downward in this country, we're seeing improvements in the census rates across skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and across all post-acute care settings. 
In addition to the solid organic growth that we are seeing in our SaaS business, we closed an exciting acquisition just this month. The company is called Health.  is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions for home infusion and specialty pharmacy as well as for home health and hospice markets.  enhances the patient experience, and it also improves provider efficiency and reduces the workload for frontline clinicians and caregivers. 
We are excited to have the team as part of the ResMed family of solutions and to leverage their digital collaboration and patient support platform in our mission to improve patients' lives outside the hospital. I'm very impressed by the breadth and depth of talent at and their passion for patient care. This goes from their CEO and Co-Founder, all the way to the front line. We're very excited to have them join our team, and we will be better together. 
As we look across our portfolio of solutions from Brightree to MatrixCare to now including HME, specialty pharmacy, home infusion, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, senior living, life plan communities and private duty home care, we expect this portfolio, this SaaS portfolio of revenue growth to accelerate, increasing from mid single-digit growth that we saw in this quarter to high single-digit growth as we move forward. 
As always, our goal is to meet or beat the sort of market average growth rates, and we continue to take share across the verticals that are in. We also see opportunity to drive growth through further acquisitions that will augment and add to our existing portfolio of solutions. Our offerings are very well received in each of these verticals, and we continue to see and leverage analytics and the technology that we have across our core business and the SaaS business to help people age in place and minimize or eliminate acute care episodes. 
Looking at the broader ResMed portfolio of business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our software as a Service solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our mission to improve lives drives and motivates ResMedians across the world every day. 
COVID has highlighted and continues to highlight the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. It is highlighted also the importance of digital health and remote care, and it has also accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis, setup as well as remote patient management and monitoring. 
We have continued to invest aggressively in R&D and innovation to ensure our solutions are best in class and are a catalyst for future growth. With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment and engagement of people with our digital health pathways. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across the 140 countries that we operate. 
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to, once again, express my sincere gratitude for the more than 7,500 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these most unusual circumstances these last 15 months. 
This team has helped save the lives literally for many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with ventilators with these emergency needs. The team is now rapidly pivoted back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD and asthma and for all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital and preferably in their own home. 
Thank you. With that, I will now hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to Q&A. Brett, over to you."

In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY '22 outlook. As Mick noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the March qu",1449,"Right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY '22 outlook. 
As Mick noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $769 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Consistent with our prediction during the Q2 earnings call, we derived negligible incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the March quarter, whereas our prior year Q3 revenue included an incremental benefit from COVID-19-related sales of approximately $35 million. Excluding this impact, our Q3 FY '21 revenue increased by 1% in constant currency terms. 
Taking a close look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase of 2%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $272 million, a decrease of 5% or a decrease of 13% in constant currency terms 
[Audio Gap] 
an increase of 7%. 
In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $173 million, a decrease of 11% or in constant currency terms, an 18% decrease. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $99 million, an increase of 9% or flat year-over-year in constant currency terms. 
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales decreased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year quarter, global device sales declined by 3% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 6% in constant currency terms. 
Software as a Service revenue for the third quarter was $94 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 40 basis points to 59.6% in the March quarter compared to 60% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight costs, additional manufacturing costs associated with the transition to our new Singapore site with commenced operations during the quarter and geographic mix changes. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 7%, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 11% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 20.9% compared to the 22.4% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q4 FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period. 
R&D expenses for the quarter were $56 million, an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 3%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 6.7% in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses in Q4 to increase year-over-year in the high single digits, reflecting our long-term commitment to innovation. 
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $18 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $242 million, an increase of 2%, reflecting well contained operating expenses. 
For the March quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million, which is net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. The audit covered tax years 2009 to 2018. As previously disclosed, for 2009 to 2013, the ATO issued assessment of $266 million, inclusive of penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 year audits remain open, ongoing and assessments have not been issued. 
We have tentatively agreed on a number with the ATO to result in the entire matter for all outer years. We expect any adjustments to the reserve we have taken this quarter would be material. Next steps include getting to a written agreement and final board approval. 
If the deal falls apart, we will litigate. We continue to believe we are more likely than not to succeed in litigation. However, transfer pricing litigation is complex, costly and uncertain. So we are looking forward to putting this behind us. 
As a result of recording the reserve, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for last quarter was 136%. While on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the reserve, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our underlying non-GAAP FY '21 effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, an increase of 1%. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.30, an increase of 1%. As a result of the tax reserve recorded this quarter, our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $78 million and our GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.54. 
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $196 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $26 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $40 million. 
During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. And going forward, we expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. 
We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $231 million. At March 31, we had $734 million in gross debt and $503 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. And at March 31, we had a further $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. 
During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Health. Health is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions that enable real-time secure collaboration between patients and those involved in their care. 
We also acquired certain business assets of Tom Mill Medical company based in Korea, which primarily represented sleep and respiratory distribution business. Both these acquisitions will not be material to our group results. 
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. 
During the pandemic, we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest the growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions like Health. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program has been on par since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019. 
Turning now to our expectations on the outlook for Q4 FY '21 and FY '22 outlook. There remains uncertainty in the short term, particularly in predicting the timing of recovery of new patient flow from COVID-19-related impacts across the many countries that we operate in. 
Consequently, we expect Q4 FY '21 revenue to reflect low single-digit sequential growth over Q3 by '21. As we move through FY '22, we expect to see continued improvement in new patient flow and a return to more normalized underlying revenue growth trends. 
Additionally, we are seeing minimal COVID-19 generating demand for our cancellate and do not expect any material benefit going forward. As a reminder, we recorded $35 million COVID-19 generated revenue in our March quarter last year, $125 million in our June quarter last year and $40 million in our first quarter of FY '21. 
Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 15 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offerings. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mass sales in FY '22. 
Finally, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, particularly in relation to the timing of the reopening of economies with the vaccination programs roll out. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.

Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And yes, clearly, as I said in the prepared remarks, the March 2020, $35 million worth of ventilators were primarily where COVID was impacting them, which was Southwest China, so primarily Hubei province and Northern Italy. So China and Italy and so clearly, the $35 million worth of sales in the March quarter last year were predominantly in that rest of world category. 
So you can imagine that the actual decline in terms of the COVID impact on year-on-year, significantly below the that 18% CC that you talked about much further below that. And really importantly, when you look at the sort of kinetics of this and you think about the December quarter to the March quarter and then what we're going to see in June, we're seeing countries opening up. They're adopting digital health, and they're finding ways to make it work. And even in France and Germany, where you did see lockdowns in the retail side, the health care was not as impacted. And our digital health solutions, particularly around remote patient screening, diagnosis have been effective. And so we're seeing that open up as we move forward.

We had seen sort of an incremental opening up. That actually slowed down. It wasn't quite as significant as before, where we really saw all of the sleep wards get converted into COVID wards, but we certainly saw a reduction in new patient flow in those countries as well and has been a significant issue. 
In terms of actually breaking out the sort of the device sales in those specific countries without the COVID impact, I don't think we'll be able to give that sort of granularity out to really clarify that for you. But underlying it, we need to understand that those sleep businesses continued. And also, you're probably aware that our ventilation businesses in Europe are a larger share than what they are -- of the ResMed business than what they are in terms of the global ResMed business. So there was a factor in that in terms of the relativities of what had happened with the incremental COVID ventilator sales in the previous period."

And if you look at just U.S., Canada, Latin America, South America's numbers, devices were down 2% year-on-year. And if you think about what we're talking about the COVID recovery rates being somewhere between 70% of pre-COVID patient flow to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow, depending on the country. 
If you just do that raw math there, that comes out to 98% of pre-COVID patient play, which is not quite there because there are some replacement devices included there. But certainly, no, we actually saw very steady market share, some gains in some of the mask areas, but very steady market share in the device side. 
Some of our competitors are having some difficulties around supply. As all of us say, with global supply chains and other factors going on, we may have even taken share in the device side. So what we're seeing just in those U.S. numbers, when you think about sequential from the December to March quarter is really all about, as I said in the prepared remarks, around deductibles, resetting of those deductibles that impacts devices significantly more than masks and accessories. 
If you look at the masks and accessories just in that quarter, we saw 7% constant currency growth in masks and accessories in the March quarter year-on-year. But look, always there's a sequential impact from December to March. And so that's in there. But no, actually share very steady, maybe moving up a little on the mask side, very steady on the devices with some modest gains, but the year-on-year 2% decline in devices is truly around the COVID recovery rates. 
And as we know, the rollout in the U.S. has actually been pretty strong in terms of the vaccinations. I don't think we're quite at the 98%, which would mean that 2% decline could indicate. But I do think that we are moving well towards the 90% range in some states and the sort of 80% range in some other states of pre-COVID patients flow. But every period we look at, we see improvement in both of those. Thanks for the question, Gretel."

Thanks, Margaret. That is a very good question and a thorough one. Look, clearly, we're very confident that the medium to long-term of the core business is incredible, given the flow of patients and the flow of our new technology. Yes, there are short-term dynamics around second and third waves and then the vaccinations on the positive side and the opening up of economies on the positive side. 
As we put it all together, we are very confident that as we get the AirSense 11 from control product launch to then start to roll that out over this calendar year in the U.S. market that, that will be a catalyst for growth. It brings not only the hardware, but also amazing software solutions for patients, physicians, providers and others. 
And as we think about the scaling of just the remote patient digital health models from some of our partners and identification, engagement and enrollment, all the way through to home sleep testing and home sleep setup and rolling out of those devices, we're seeing a lot of investments start to pay off on that. 
So look, it's really hard to get down to the dynamics of how quickly vaccines will go, how quickly economies will open up. But here in the U.S., which is our biggest market, we're certainly seeing both of those trend in a really positive manner, and that led me to talk about pretty bullish sort of double-digit growth towards the back end of our fiscal year 2022. 
And so I think they're all the dynamics going into it. I don't know, Jim Hollingshead, if you've got any further thoughts as the President of our sleep and respiratory care business about how quickly we can use that technology to drive growth towards that back end?"

Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret, for the question. I really just would reiterate what Mick said. I think that when you think about growth, when we get back to double-digit growth, the numbers were against or the big comps that came out of COVID, right? So when you think about growth as a percentage. And so the underlying dynamic in the market in the U.S., specifically about the U.S. market is pretty strong. March was the best month of the quarter for us in new patient growth in the U.S. market. And so we think that, that trend is going to continue, and we're very hopeful about vaccine roll out world start to open up diagnostics. And of course, we have the new product that will come out in the calendar year. 
So we feel very confident about the underlying core the business continuing to grow over the coming quarters and then we'll be able to not just maintain share but probably take some share. So -- but there's obviously some uncertainties associated with COVID and some other things, where we feel very confident in the underlying growth dynamic, and it's the COVID comp that has to clear for us to be able to talk about double-digit growth."

And it talks to within our Software as a Service business, obviously, we have privacy. We have cybersecurity, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability, making sure our data can -- through secure private APIs be able to interact with hospital care systems is an incredibly important part of the system. 
We call it out-of-hospital health care because we don't believe we have to go to hospitals to get good health care. But the hospital systems call it post acute care. And that link between post-acute care and out-of-hospital care has to be very secure and have to be very seamless, if you like, for the patient and for the health care system. 
We're now many quarters into our Cerner partnership and what we've shown in that to our partner there, Cerner is that ResMed is a great recipient of patients from the hospital system into both home health and hospice and beyond now into infusion with that partnership. And I think we've got a sort of a track record that ResMed can take care of those patients and make sure that there's a seamless transition from hospital to the out-of-hospital health care network. 
And so with that proven back record, I look to their customers, those sort of Cerner, Epic and Allscripts, their customers being HCA and others. As HCA sort of broadens their holistic care, if you like, of patients from hospital to the home, that's an opportunity for those providers to partner with someone like ResMed. So there was a seamless transfer of the patients. 
Look, the ultimate goal is that we take costs out of the system, we take care of the patient better and we have a seamless transfer from hospital to home or out-of-hospital care. And then hopefully not, but if you do go back to the hospital, that record can move back and forward very well. We've got a good track record of it. And I actually see a lot of upside as hospital systems think holistically in that sort of ACO, sort of accountable care organization approach. And we've got a lot of experience in Western Europe in patients taking care holistically throughout Northern Europe and beyond. 
So I'm confident that we will do well in this evolution of sort of an acute care system or a sick care system to a true health care system and a preventative health care system, which is where ResMed bets 90-plus percent of our revenues and profits. And really with the SaaS business, it's where we are the only strategic with the capability to scale, not just across the U.S., but globally."

So the first part, the AirSense 11 is out there, it's in control product launch. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'm personally part of that CPL and just amazing benefits for the individual patient and the bed partner in terms of how quite comfortable cloud connected and capable it is. 
So the features are extraordinary. One thing -- we've opened up for the most we ever have around a pipeline that is out there because there's a public regulatory documents out there, and it's I don't want to go through all the features and functions other than to say that, that it's smaller. It's quiter. It's more comfortable. It's more cloud connected and it's not just the device. It's the software system that goes with it that provides the value for not just the patient, but the physician, the provider and the health care system that are part of it. 
So to the second part of your question around growth, yes, look, I do think this will be a catalyst for growth. That's why I'm comfortable in the preplan and earlier to talk about our confidence in saying we're going to push towards double-digit growth for the back end of this fiscal year that we're in here. And I this device will be a catalyst for it. I think the software, the digital health technology software around it will be a large part of that catalyst for growth. Obviously, we're a different business than -- when I was running the sleep group, we launched the S9. I think the total revenues of the company were less than $1 billion, and now the total revenues are over $3 billion trailing 12 months. 
And so the percentage growth, the numbers won't be as impressive as 10 years ago, but the growth in terms of net revenue and profitability that we can reinvest in the business for more devices and more software will certainly be there. 
The third part of your question around cost. Clearly, our goal, every generation is to create smaller, quieter and more comfortable, more clever devices and software systems, but also ones that have better efficiencies. So with lower cost of manufacturing, lower cost to our supply chain. So clearly, that's an important part of this platform.

It's a great question, and there are so many dynamics of hospital care and then the flow out through post-acute care to our SaaS system. I think, as we look forward, we saw 5% growth in the quarter across our SaaS business. We think the weighted average market growth across those 7 or now 8 verticals that we're in with joining the portfolio in specialty pharmacy and home infusion, we think that sort of mid single-digit growth can move towards high single-digit growth as we see patients get back to the hospital and, therefore, get back to then discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and beyond. 
And so it's difficult to say the exact rate of increase, but it's going to increase. And I think our technology and what we've invested in, particularly, even during COVID, some of the software that we put for our skilled nursing facility customers to manage patients who may or may not be infected by COVID and how they operate their businesses have been very well received. 
So even as case rates decline, but COVID is still here, and it is still across -- even with vaccinations going up, still going to impact those customers. I think some of those tools will help us see a faster path to getting from that mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth across the group. 
And as I said in the prep remarks, and this is true for ResMed always, we don't just want to meet market growth. We want to beat that market growth. So as I look towards our long-term strategy in 2025, we've got the opportunity to get way back to that double-digit growth in our SaaS business. But in the short to medium term, I think we can move from mid-single digits to high single digits in this part of our portfolio. We've made investments in the technology. We made the investments for the customers to help them deal with the dynamics of COVID. And as the recovery happens, we will be partners for them for growth on the other side."

Feel free to reach out to Amy, and she can bring you up to speed. 
But basically, AHRQ, we believe, is taking a very narrow perspective on looking at the clinical literature, looking at only randomized controlled trials done under certain very careful criteria. And while traditionally, that has been the hallmark of the gold standard of trials, we think, particularly in this industry when you've got a massive amount of real-world evidence and a lot of other longitudinal trials that clearly demonstrate benefits in terms of longevity, benefits in terms of clinically significant cardiovascular outcomes, also quality of life outcomes and also outcomes in terms of health care utilization and lower cost, all of that evidence ought to be used to come to a conclusion that treating sleep apnea with CPAP therapy is not only good for patients, but good for the health care systems and good for economies as a whole. 
So we're hopeful that all that evidence that we've brought in, and it's not just us, other societies, many of the clinical societies have come out, and there's been a vigorous sort of cross industry-wide cross clinical, academic key opinion leaders. Have all come out in the same direction. So we're hopeful that, that will be taken into account. 
And the final report, which we don't know when it will be, but likely perhaps later this calendar year, we'll include that data and come to a better conclusion."

So if you're just looking at RCTs, even you need to include some of those RCTs, which were, in fact, very positive. And the AHRQ just looked at some neutral RCTs and said, well, neutral it means no benefit. And like, wait, there's all these other preponderance of evidence, real-world and RCTs that are positive. So it was an interesting subsection of the literature that they used. And we have lots of folks, us and academics working on that. 
On the second part of your question, SaaS, look, it actually was a strong tailwind for us in this quarter, a 5% growth versus the COVID included core part of the business. And I think it can be, as we look forward, and I spoke to this earlier in my answer to Andrew about SaaS going from mid-single digits to high single digits, I think it can and then meeting or beating that. 
So getting to double-digit growth in the SaaS part of our business. I do think that, that will become a tailwind for us. That 12% of our revenue is that SaaS as we get out of the COVID sort of slowdown of census rates in this out-of-hospital care, we get back to a normal flow of patients through because people are wanting to age and pace. People are wanting to be outside the hospital. COVID just increased the probability that people do not want to be in a hospital for any longer than they need to. And so I think the geographic and socioeconomic trends of a growing community and people wanting to aging place and an aging population and the fact that people are seeing lower cost, lower acuity and better health care delivered outside the hospital all lead towards this. 
The dynamics of how quickly we go from mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, we can debate. But the fact is it's going to go there because people are moving from the hospital to out-of-hospital health care, and that's where we're investing. 
So as I look forward to our long-term strategy, 2025, I am very confident that this will be a very strong tailwind to our business. The recovery of our whole business post-COVID is what we're talking about here. But I look on the end of fiscal year 2022, strong double-digit growth across our business. And I mean that across our whole business. Thanks for the question, Suraj."

I mean, clearly, there's consolidation of some players in the HME industry. And that can impact our contracts with those. 
In general, SaaS is a per user, per month -- like per activated user per month. Approach. And so acquisitions in HME acquiring another HME that doesn't currently use Brightree is actually upside for us because usually the acquiring entity has all the efficiencies and scale and capabilities because they're using Brightree and then they put that into the acquired account. And so therefore, actually increase the number of users and per user per month revenue for ResMed can be an upside on that. 
If it's a Brightree user acquiring another Brightree user, well, then there can be some reduction, they might get some efficiencies and reductions of the number of chairs. But ultimately, if it's a smart customer, it's going to continue to grow. And so then that over time, as they grow, we'll increase our revenues as part of that. So a lot of dynamics around the M&A there. But in general, in the long run for us, it's about us betting on the winning and efficient HMEs and Brightree helps us do that because the people who adopt Brightree other winners. They have the lowest costs and the best outcomes for their patients. 
To the second part of your question around sleep labs, look, I look on the capacity here in the U.S. and the reduction that happened during COVID of inlab tests. Those people scale their digital health solutions and their home sleep testing capabilities. So as they come back and open up the inlab facilities, I think that will absolutely have a rebound of the capacity in the but they won't lose what they gained in home lot testing. 
As said, when the mind is stretched by a new idea, it never returns to its original size. So they're not going to forget about these great digital health solutions they have for home sleep testing. So yes, we'll get the capacity back in the sleep labs, but I also think the scalable opportunity for those sleep diagnostics provides -- to provide lower cost customer-friendly diagnostics in the home will be just a part of their portfolio and hopefully, will improve the rate of diagnosing the 936 million people worldwide, we're just looking at the U.S., the 70 million people in this country that have mild, severe or struck on sleep apnea that need to be taken care of.

On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q3 business metrics, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. I will review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and our annual operating priorities.
A year ago today, when we discussed our March 2020 results, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of our business, particularly in the United States, had not yet been significantly impacted. However, outside the U.S., countries including China and Italy were already in the midst of emergency needs. We quickly mobilized our supply chain and global operations to address and support ventilation needs worldwide, producing over 150,000 ventilators. We accelerated the production and distribution of noninvasive and life support ventilators and mass systems to those in need, resulting in an incremental $35 million of COVID-related revenue during the March 2020 quarter.
I'm incredibly proud of how we quickly pivoted our business to meet that need, providing life-saving solutions around the world so that health care systems were prepared with the resources needed to treat patients who are fighting COVID-19.
Today, one year later, the countries we operate in are at various different stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of getting to normal patient flow. We see a range of -- from 70% of pre-COVID patient flow in some countries, up to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow in other countries.
Vaccines are steadily rolling out in the United States, the U.K. and many other countries worldwide. We still see significant impact from ongoing second, third and fourth waves of infection in some countries in Europe as well as in South America and Asia, and especially right now in the country of Brazil and in particularly India. Our team is working with hospitals and health care providers in those 2 countries and beyond for preservation of life, making sure that they have ventilators, masks and the training that they need to use them.
We continue to support the frontline respiratory therapists and the physicians who are there on the ground as well as providers, patients and ResMedians throughout the 140-plus countries that we operate in.
We're pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in getting new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients diagnosed. Excluding the $35 million of COVID-related ventilator sales in the March 2020 quarter, our team delivered positive sales growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business this quarter on both the headline and constant currency basis.
We forecast a steady improvement trend of patient flow for sleep apnea and COPD and asthma continuing as we move through 2021 and into 2022. We expect this progress to accelerate as global vaccination rates continue. We are encouraged to see that patients, physicians and providers around the world are adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, home-based testing, remote patient monitoring and ongoing patient management.
I'd like to be clear that the ventilation sales that we made in 2020 will be part of our comparables for the next 2 quarters. In the June 2020 quarter, we recognized $125 million in COVID-related ventilator sales. And in September 2020 quarter, we recognized $40 million in such revenue.
Over the coming quarters, we expect to continue to show strong positive year-over-year revenue growth excluding these onetime sales from 2020. As we look further forward, we see a clear path to double-digit revenue growth in the back half of our fiscal year 2022 across our full business, powered by opening economies and our pipeline of new technology and innovation.
Our headline results were impacted this quarter by an accounting reserve we took in connection with discussions with the Australian Tax Office, or ATO, regarding their ongoing audit dating back to fiscal year 2009. Brett has been leading those discussions and will speak to the details in his remarks.
I will make this statement: ResMed pays significant taxes in countries around the world, and we operate in over 140 countries, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives well away from the hospital. Brett and his team are working towards a final resolution of these transfer pricing discussions dating back over 12 years with the ATO. So we have taken this $255 million reserve. We believe that resolving these discussions is the pragmatic thing to do for all of our stakeholders so that we can put this behind us and focus all of our efforts on our core mission of improving lives in respiratory medicine around the world.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $196 million in operating cash, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders. We also increased our R&D investments in the period in digital health technology as well as R&D for hardware, embedded software and clinical research while maintaining financial discipline with reduced SG&A and other operating costs.
We have seen increased demand for our digital health solutions from patients, physicians, providers and health care systems around the world as they embrace remote patient engagement and adopt population health management. We are the clear leader in this field with over 14 million cloud-connectable medical devices in the market. And our ongoing and increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure we provide superior value to patients, physicians and providers to be their partner of choice.
We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We fight for it every day through innovation.
Our digital technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value, with an industry-leading IP portfolio, including over 8,000 patents and designs. We now have over 8.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 15.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution. And we also have over 105 million patients managed within our Software as a Service network for out-of-hospital health care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customers, patients, physicians, providers as well as private and government payers.
Let me take a few minutes to share some recent clinical highlights that show how we are working with researchers to advance the field of sleep and respiratory medicine with these data and beyond.
During 2020, an important 30-year duration study was published in the European Respiratory Journal, following over 4,500 diagnosed OSA patients to better understand the long-term impacts of untreated sleep apnea. The study showed that untreated sleep apnea leads to high incidence of myocardial infarction or heart attack, high incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and high incidence of ischemic heart disease. This real-world clinical analysis is showing that what we've known for over 3 decades: sleep apnea is a public health epidemic that simply can't be ignored.
In terms of clinical quality of life improvement from CPAP therapy, the data are also clear. In late 2019, the multicenter, randomized controlled trial called MERGE, was published in the journal, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The results were that patients randomized to CPAP demonstrated clear improvement in quality of life for CPAP patients versus standard of care with symptomatic benefits, including reductions in sleepiness as well as improvements in fatigue and importantly, depression, a key part of mental health. Importantly, these results were evident in both mild as well as moderate and severe sleep apnea.
In terms of economic data and a dose response relationship from CPAP therapy, the data are also unequivocal. In 2019, a study was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine showing a quantified dose response relationship from CPAP therapy. So for every additional hour of positive airway pressure use, there was an 8% decrease in hospital inpatient visits and a 4% decrease in overall physician visits. In other words, treating sleep apnea with our CPAP therapy not only improves lives, it also saves money for the health care system by lowering total health care utilization costs.
During the quarter, we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, here in the U.S. market. AHRQ sort input and ResMed-filed public comments, along with comments from many physician groups, sleep apnea patient advocates, provider groups and beyond. I won't repeat all the details of those public comments, but I will say this, we presented peer-reviewed and published data showing that CPAP therapy improves quality of life, reduces health care costs and even reduces mortality.
In short, these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market, we are saving lives and saving money for the health care system through our medical technology. We have peer-reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack, a reduction in hypertension as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors. All of these are logical sequelae of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with CPAP therapy in treated sleep apnea patients.
We are encouraged by technical studies completed by the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness, the acronym is NICE, in the U.K. Just last month, NICE made public their 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that CPAP therapy, along with telemonitoring, is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild OSA. That would be an expansion of coverage in the U.K. and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market.
Similarly, the Ministries of Health in France, Germany and Japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in this space. It's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as governments see improvement in outcomes and reductions in total health care system costs with this technology.
While we respect the work of AHRQ, we, along with many other academic research-focused institutes and practicing physician groups, believe that they bypassed a generation of data in real-world evidence that needs to be taken into account, along with their own select group of RCTs in the draft report. We are optimistic that the final report when issued will reflect the preponderance of real-world evidence and broader RCTs, showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive airway pressure.
Okay. Let me now update you on our top-3 ResMed strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably, in a person's home.
In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night. The rate of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy in the U.S. was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the March quarter, primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year. This seasonal impact affects devices more than mass systems, given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the 2 categories.
We expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality. We continue to see strong ongoing mask and accessory resupply in the U.S. market and beyond.
New patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent COVID-related case surges in select countries in Asia and Europe, including 2 large markets, France and Germany. We see that impact the number of patients going for clinic-based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries. We expect to see these markets reopen, along with hospitals, as vaccines continue to roll out and as we see further scaling of the remote home-based diagnostic capacity.
Clearly, the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control. However, we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners, which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes.
More broadly, we are seeing growth in total sleep -- total new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. And we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter. Importantly, our market-leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices, and we're excited about our future pipeline. We rarely talk about our future pipeline as those who followed us for a period of time know. But today, I would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next-generation sleep apnea platform.
You may have seen some recent U.S. regulatory filings that we made for our next-generation flow generator platform called the AirSense 11. Clearly, there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step, but we are making good progress. Earlier this month, we started a limited controlled product launch of the AirSense 11 in certain parts of the United States. We expect to move to a broader commercial launch of the platform later this calendar year in the U.S. and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that.
For now, I can say that as a personal user of our CPAP therapy, I have firsthand knowledge that the AirSense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners. And our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians, providers, payers and beyond, and ultimately continue to catalyze ResMed's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for COPD, asthma and other key chronic diseases.
We make the smallest, quietest, smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. Importantly, they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence, improve clinical outcomes and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers' own health care systems.
Let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD, or chronic constructive pulmonary disease, patients and the 340 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions, including both noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical drug delivery devices and high flow therapy devices.
Our respiratory care business benefited in the March 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilated devices and ventilation mask solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic. During the March 2021 quarter, COVID-related ventilator sales were not material to the global business. However, we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest COVID surges, such as just this month with the surge in India. We're getting many thousands of devices to those in need. The demand is there in that country.
But as in Q3, we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business, even though the broader impact, particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless and incredibly important to not only our local team in India, but to all of us here at ResMed worldwide.
Demand for our core noninvasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea. We are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply of ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs.
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago. We are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world. The value being provided through this cloud-based software solution has been fruitful not only during the COVID pandemic and the peak part of the crisis, but it's also valuable on an ongoing value basis for physicians as well as the health care systems they operate in. We are hoping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care.
Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets. The verticals include home medical equipment, or HME, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, senior living and life plan communities.
Our HME customers are leveraging our advanced resupply solutions, including snap technology and Brightree resupply for our existing portfolio of patients. And they are contributing to ongoing growth as the flow of new patients in HME continues to recover steadily period by period.
Over the past 12 months, COVID-19 has had a dampening effect on elective and emergent procedures at hospitals, as we all know, and that has slowed hospital discharge rates affecting patient flow and ultimately, the census rates at skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and beyond. As the rate of vaccinations accelerate across the U.S. and the number of COVID-19 cases continues to trend downward in this country, we're seeing improvements in the census rates across skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and across all post-acute care settings.
In addition to the solid organic growth that we are seeing in our SaaS business, we closed an exciting acquisition just this month. The company is called Citus Health. Citus is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions for home infusion and specialty pharmacy as well as for home health and hospice markets. Citus enhances the patient experience, and it also improves provider efficiency and reduces the workload for frontline clinicians and caregivers.
We are excited to have the Citus team as part of the ResMed family of solutions and to leverage their digital collaboration and patient support platform in our mission to improve patients' lives outside the hospital. I'm very impressed by the breadth and depth of talent at Citus and their passion for patient care. This goes from their CEO and Co-Founder all the way to the frontline. We're very excited to have them join our team, and we will be better together.
As we look across our portfolio of solutions from Brightree to MatrixCare to now Citus including HME, specialty pharmacy, home infusion, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, senior living, life plan communities and private duty home care, we expect this portfolio, this SaaS portfolio of revenue growth to accelerate, increasing from mid-single-digit growth that we saw in this quarter to high single-digit growth as we move forward.
As always, our goal is to meet or beat the sort of market average growth rates, and we continue to take share across the verticals that we're in. We also see opportunity to drive growth through further acquisitions that will augment and add to our existing portfolio of solutions. Our offerings are very well received in each of these verticals, and we continue to see and leverage analytics and the technology that we have across our core business and the SaaS business to help people age in place and minimize or eliminate acute care episodes.
Looking at the broader ResMed portfolio of business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our Software as a Service solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our mission to improve lives, strives and motivates ResMedians across the world every day. COVID has highlighted and continues to highlight the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. It has highlighted also the importance of digital health and remote care, and it has also accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis, setup as well as remote patient management and monitoring.
We have continued to invest aggressively in R&D and innovation to ensure our solutions are best in class and are a catalyst for future growth. With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment and engagement of people with our digital health pathways. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across the 140 countries that we operate in.
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude for the more than 7,500 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these most unusual circumstances these last 15 months. This team has helped save the lives literally of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with ventilators with these emergency needs. The team is now rapidly pivoted back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD and asthma. And for all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital and preferably in their own home.
Thank you. With that, I will now hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to Q&A. Brett, over to you."

In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY '22 outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.Group revenue for the March quar",1474,"Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY '22 outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.
Group revenue for the March quarter was $769 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter.
Consistent with our prediction during the Q2 earnings call, we derived negligible incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the March quarter, whereas our prior year Q3 revenue included an incremental benefit from COVID-19-related sales of approximately $35 million. Excluding these impacts, our Q3 FY '21 revenue increased by 1% in constant currency terms.
Taking a close look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase of 2%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $272 million, a decrease of 5% or a decrease of 13% in constant currency terms.
By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $193 million, a decrease of 2%. Masks and other sales were $210 million, an increase of 7%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $173 million, a decrease of 11% or in constant currency terms, an 18% decrease. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $99 million, an increase of 9% or flat year-over-year in constant currency terms.
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales decreased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year quarter, global device sales declined by 3% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 6% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the third quarter was $94 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter.
During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.
Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 40 basis points to 59.6% in the March quarter compared to 60% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight costs, additional manufacturing costs associated with the transition to our new Singapore site with commenced operations during the quarter and geographic mix changes.
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 7%, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 11% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 20.9% compared to the 22.4% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q4 FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.
R&D expenses for the quarter were $56 million, an increase of 9%, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 3%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 6.7% in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses in Q4 to increase year-over-year in the high single digits, reflecting our long-term commitment to innovation.
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $18 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $242 million, an increase of 2%, reflecting well-contained operating expenses.
For the March quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million, which is net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. The audit covered tax years 2009 to 2018. As previously disclosed, for 2009 to 2013, the ATO issued assessment of $266 million, inclusive of penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 year audits remain open, ongoing and assessments have not been issued.
We have tentatively agreed on a number with the ATO to result in the entire matter for all audit years. We expect any adjustments to the reserve we have taken this quarter would be immaterial. Next steps include getting to a written agreement and final board approval.
If the deal falls apart, we will litigate. We continue to believe we are more likely than not to succeed in litigation. However, transfer pricing litigation is complex, costly and uncertain. So we are looking forward to putting this behind us.
As a result of recording the reserve, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 136%. While on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the reserve, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our underlying non-GAAP FY '21 effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%.
Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, an increase of 1%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.30, an increase of 1%. As a result of the tax reserve recorded this quarter, our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $78 million and our GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.54.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $196 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $26 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $40 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.
We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. And going forward, we expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $231 million. At March 31, we had $734 million in gross debt and $503 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. And at March 31, we had a further $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility.
In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Citus Health. Citus Health is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions that enable real-time secure collaboration between patients and those involved in their care. We also acquired certain business assets of [indiscernible] medical company based in Korea, which primarily represented [indiscernible] sleep and respiratory distribution business. Both these acquisitions will not be material to our group results.
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic, we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest the growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions like Citus Health.
We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program has been on hold since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019.
Turning now to our expectations on the outlook for Q4 FY '21 and FY '22 outlook. There remains uncertainty in the short term, particularly in predicting the timing of recovery of new patient flow from COVID-19-related impacts across the many countries that we operate in. Consequently, we expect Q4 FY '21 revenue to reflect low single-digit sequential growth over Q3 FY '21.
As we move through FY '22, we expect to see continued improvement in new patient flow and a return to more normalized underlying revenue growth trends. Additionally, we are seeing minimal COVID-19 generating demand for our ventilators and do not expect any material benefit going forward. As a reminder, we recorded $35 million COVID-19 generated revenue in our March quarter last year, $125 million in our June quarter last year and $40 million in our first quarter of FY '21.
Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offerings. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in FY '22.
Finally, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, particularly in relation to the timing of the reopening of economies with the vaccination programs roll out. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And yes, clearly, as I said in the prepared remarks, the March 2020, $35 million worth of ventilators were primarily where COVID was impacting them, which was Southwest China, so primarily Hubei province and Northern Italy. So China and Italy and so clearly, the $35 million worth of sales in the March quarter last year were predominantly in that rest of world category.
So you can imagine that the actual decline in terms of the COVID impact on year-on-year significantly is below that 18% CC that you talked about, much further below that. And really importantly, when you look at the sort of kinetics of this and you think about the December quarter to the March quarter and then what we're going to see in June, we've seen countries opening up. They're adopting digital health, and they're finding ways to make it work. And even in France and Germany, where you did see lockdowns in the retail side, the health care was not as impacted. And our digital health solutions, particularly around remote patient screening, diagnosis have been effective. And so we're seeing that open up as we move forward.

We had seen sort of an incremental opening up. That actually slowed down. It wasn't quite as significant as before, where we really saw all of the sleep labs get converted into COVID wards, but we certainly saw a reduction in new patient flow in those countries as well and has been a significant issue.
In terms of actually breaking out the sort of the device sales in those specific countries without the COVID impact, Lyanne, I don't think we'll be able to give that sort of granularity to really clarify that for you. But underlying it, we need to understand that those sleep businesses continued. And also, you're probably aware that our ventilation businesses in Europe are a larger share than what they are -- of the ResMed business than what they are in terms of the global ResMed business. So there was a factor in that in terms of the relativities of what had happened with the incremental COVID ventilator sales in the previous period."

And if you look at just U.S., Canada, Latin America, South America's numbers, devices were down 2% year-on-year. And if you think about what we're talking about the COVID recovery rates being somewhere between 70% of pre-COVID patient flow to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow, depending on the country. If you just do that raw math there, that comes out to 98% of pre-COVID patient level, which is not quite there because there are some replacement devices included there. But certainly, no, we actually saw very steady market share, some gains in some of the mask areas, but very steady market share in the device side.
Some of our competitors are having some difficulties around supply as all of us are, with global supply chains and other factors going on, we may have even taken share in the device side. So what we're seeing just in those U.S. numbers, when you think about sequential from the December to March quarter is really all about, as I said in the prepared remarks, around deductibles, resetting of those deductibles that impacts devices significantly more than masks and accessories.
If you look at the masks and accessories just in that quarter, we saw 7% constant currency growth in masks and accessories in the March quarter year-on-year. But look, always there's a sequential impact from December to March. And so that's in there. But no, actually share very steady, maybe moving up a little on the mask side, very steady on the devices with some modest gains, but the year-on-year 2% decline in devices is truly around the COVID recovery rates.
And as we know, the rollout in the U.S. has actually been pretty strong in terms of the vaccinations. I don't think we're quite at the 98%, which would mean that 2% decline could indicate. But I do think that we are moving well towards the 90% range in some states and the sort of 80% range in some other states of pre-COVID patients flow. But every period we look at, we see improvement in both of those. Thanks for the question, Gretel."

Thanks, Margaret. That is a very good question and a thorough one. Look, clearly, we're very confident that the medium to long-term of the core business is incredible, given the flow of patients and the flow of our new technology. Yes, there are short-term dynamics around second and third waves and then the vaccinations on the positive side and the opening up of economies on the positive side.
As we put it all together, we are very confident that as we get the AirSense 11 from control product launch to then start to roll that out over this calendar year in the U.S. market that, that will be a catalyst for growth. It brings not only the hardware, but also amazing software solutions for patients, physicians, providers and others.
And as we think about the scaling of just the remote patient digital health models from some of our partners and identification, engagement and enrollment, all the way through to home sleep testing and home sleep setup and rolling out of those devices, we're seeing a lot of investments start to pay off on that.
So look, it's really hard to get down to the dynamics of how quickly vaccines will go, how quickly economies will open up. But here in the U.S., which is our biggest market, we're certainly seeing both of those trend in a really positive manner, and that led me to talk about pretty bullish sort of double-digit growth towards the back end of our fiscal year 2022.
And so I think they're all the dynamics going into it. I don't know, Jim Hollingshead, if you've got any further thoughts as the President of our sleep and respiratory care business about how quickly we can use that technology to drive growth towards that back end?"

And so we think that, that trend is going to continue, and we're very hopeful about vaccine roll out, world start to open up diagnostics. And of course, we have the new product that will come out in the calendar year.
So we feel very confident about the underlying core sleep business continuing to grow over the coming quarters and then we'll be able to not just maintain share but probably take some share. So -- but there's obviously some uncertainties associated with COVID and some other things, where we feel very confident in the underlying growth dynamic, and it's the COVID comp that has to clear for us to be able to talk about double-digit growth."

And it talks to within our Software as a Service business, obviously, we have privacy. We have cybersecurity, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability, making sure our data can -- through secure private API",443,"Yes. Matt, it's a great question. And it talks to within our Software as a Service business, obviously, we have privacy. We have cybersecurity, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability, making sure our data can -- through secure private APIs, be able to interact with hospital care systems is an incredibly important part of the system.
We call it out-of-hospital health care because we don't believe we have to go to hospital to get good health care. But the hospital systems call it post-acute care. And that link between post-acute care and out-of-hospital care has to be very secure and has to be very seamless, if you like, for the patient and for the health care system.
We're now many quarters into our Cerner partnership and what we've shown in that to our partner there, Cerner, is that ResMed is a great recipient of patients from the hospital system into both home health and hospice and beyond now into infusion with that partnership. And I think we've got a sort of a track record that ResMed can take care of those patients and make sure that there's a seamless transition from hospital to the out-of-hospital health care network.
And so with that proven back record, I look -- to their customers, those sort of Cerner, Epic and Allscripts, their customers being HCA and others. As HCA sort of broadens their holistic care, if you like, of patients from hospital to the home, that's an opportunity for those providers to partner with someone like ResMed. So that there's a seamless transfer of the patients.
Look, the ultimate goal is that we take costs out of the system, we take care of the patient better, and we have a seamless transfer from hospital to home or out-of-hospital care. And then hopefully not, but if you do go back to the hospital, that record can move back and forward very well. We've got a good track record of it. And I actually see a lot of upside as hospital systems think holistically in that sort of ACO, sort of accountable care organization approach. And we've got a lot of experience in Western Europe in patients taking care holistically throughout Northern Europe and beyond.
So I'm confident that we will do well in this evolution of sort of an acute care system or a sick care system to a true health care system and a preventative health care system, which is where ResMed bets 90-plus percent of our revenues and profits. And really with the SaaS business, it's where we are the only strategic with the capability to scale, not just across the U.S., but globally."

So the first part, the AirSense 11 is out there, it's in control product launch. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'm personally part of that CPL and just amazing benefits for the individual patient and the bed partner in terms of how quite, comfortable, cloud connected and capable it is. So the features are extraordinary.
One thing -- we've opened up for the most we ever have around a pipeline that is out there because there's a public regulatory documents out there, and it's in CPL. I don't want to go through all the features and functions other than to say that, that it's smaller. It's quieter. It's more comfortable. It's more cloud-connected and it's not just the device, it's the software system that goes with it that provides the value for not just the patient, but the physician, the provider and the health care system that are part of it.
So to the second part of your question around growth, yes, look, I do think this will be a catalyst for growth. That's why I'm comfortable in the prep remarks and answer to Gretel earlier to talk about our confidence in saying we're going to push towards double-digit growth for the back end of this fiscal year that we're in here. And I think this device will be a catalyst for it. I think the software, the digital health technology software around it will be a large part of that catalyst for growth. Obviously, we're a different business than -- when I was running the sleep group, we launched the S9. It was -- I think the total revenues of the company were less than $1 billion, and now the total revenues are over $3 billion trailing 12 months. And so the percentage growth, the numbers won't be as impressive as 10 years ago, but the growth in terms of net revenue and profitability that we can reinvest in the business for more devices and more software will certainly be there.
The third part of your question around cost. Clearly, our goal, every generation is to create smaller, quieter and more comfortable, more clever devices and software systems, but also ones that have better efficiencies. So it will lower cost of manufacturing, lower cost to our supply chain. So clearly, that's an important part of this platform. We expect to do that, as you said, as we scale that up across our global business."

It's a great question, and there are so many dynamics of hospital care and then the flow out through post-acute care to our SaaS system. I think, as we look forward, we saw 5% growth in the quarter across our SaaS business. We think the weighted average market growth across those 7 or now 8 verticals that we're in with Citus joining the portfolio in specialty pharmacy and home infusion, we think that sort of mid-single-digit growth can move towards high single-digit growth as we see patients get back to the hospital and, therefore, get back to being discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and beyond.
And so it's difficult to say the exact rate of increase, but it's going to increase. And I think our technology and what we've invested in, particularly, even during COVID, some of the software that we put for our skilled nursing facility customers to manage patients who may or may not be infected by COVID and how they operate their businesses have been very well received. So even as case rates decline, but COVID is still here, and it is still across -- even with vaccinations going up, still going to impact those customers. I think some of those tools will help us see a faster path to getting from that mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth across the group. 
And as I said in the prep remarks, and this is true for ResMed always, we don't just want to meet market growth. We want to beat that market growth. So as I look towards our long-term strategy in 2025, we've got the opportunity to get way back to that double-digit growth in our SaaS business. But in the short to medium term, I think we can move from mid-single digits to high single digits in this part of our portfolio. We've made the investments in the technology. We made the investments for the customers to help them deal with the dynamics of COVID. And as the recovery happens, we will be partners for them for growth on the other side."

Thanks, Suraj. And I'll give you just kind of a brief response here if you want any more details, feel free to reach out to Amy, and she can bring you up to speed.
But basically, AHRQ, we believe, is taking a very narrow perspective on looking at the clinical literature, looking at only randomized controlled trials done under certain very careful criteria. And while traditionally, that has been the hallmark of the gold standard of trials, we think, particularly in this industry wherein you've got a massive amount of real-world evidence and a lot of other longitudinal trials that clearly demonstrate benefits in terms of longevity, benefits in terms of clinically significant cardiovascular outcomes, also quality of life outcomes and also outcomes in terms of health care utilization and lower cost, all of that evidence ought to be used to come to a conclusion that treating sleep apnea with CPAP therapy is not only good for patients, but good for the health care systems and good for economies as a whole.
So we're hopeful that all that evidence that we've brought in, and it's not just us, other societies, many of the clinical societies have come out, and there's been a vigorous sort of cross-industry wide, across clinical and academic key opinion leaders have all come out in the same direction. So we're hopeful that, that will be taken into account. And the final report, which we don't know when it will be, but likely perhaps later this calendar year, will include that data and come to a better conclusion."

So if you're just looking at RCTs even, you need to include some of those RCTs, which were, in fact, very positive. And the AHRQ just looked at some neutral RCTs and said, well, neutral doesn't means no benefit. Like, wait, there's all these other preponderance of evidence, real-world and RCTs that are positive. So it was an interesting subsection of the literature that they used. And we have lots of folks, us and academics working on that.
On the second part of your question, SaaS. Look, it actually was a strong tailwind for us in this quarter, a 5% growth versus the COVID included core part of the business. And I think it can be, as we look forward, and I spoke to this earlier in my answer to Andrew about SaaS going from mid-single digits to high single digits, I think it can and then us meeting or beating that. So getting to double-digit growth in the SaaS part of our business. I do think that, that will become a tailwind for us. That 12% of our revenue is also that SaaS as we get out of the COVID sort of slowdown of census rates in this out-of-hospital care, we get back to a normal flow of patients through because people are wanting to age in place.
People are wanting to be outside the hospital. COVID just increased the probability that people do not want to be in a hospital for any longer than they need to. And so I think the geographic and socioeconomic trends of a growing community and people wanting to age in place and an aging population and the fact that people are seeing lower cost, lower acuity and better health care delivered outside the hospital all lead towards this.
The dynamics of how quickly we go from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, we can debate. But the fact is it's going to go there because people are moving from the hospital to out-of-hospital health care, and that's where we're investing. So as I look forward to our long-term strategy, 2025, I am very confident that this will be a very strong tailwind to our business. The recovery of our whole business post-COVID is what we're talking about here. But I look on the end of FY 2022, strong double-digit growth across our business. And I mean that across our whole business. Thanks for the questions, Suraj."

And so therefore, actually increase the number of users and per user per month revenue for ResMed can be an upside on that.
If it's a Brightree user acquiring another Brightree user, well, then there can be some reduction, they might get some efficiencies and reductions of the number of chairs. But ultimately, if it's a smart customer, it's going to continue to grow. And so then that over time, as they grow, will increase our revenues as part of that. So a lot of dynamics around the M&A there. But in general, in the long run for us, it's about us betting on the winning and efficient HMEs and Brightree helps us do that because the people who adopt Brightree are the winners. They have the lowest costs and the best outcomes for their patients.
To the second part of your question around sleep labs. Look, I look on the capacity here in the U.S. and the reduction that happened during COVID of the in-lab tests. Those people scale their digital health solutions and their home sleep testing capabilities. So as they come back and open up the in-lab facilities, I think that will absolutely have a rebound of the capacity in the in-labs, but they won't lose what they gained in home sleep testing.
As Aristotle said, when the mind is stretched by a new idea, it never returns to its original size. So they're not going to forget about these great digital health solutions they have for home sleep testing. So yes, we'll get the capacity back in the sleep labs, but I also think the scalable opportunity for those sleep diagnostics provides -- to provide lower-cost, customer-friendly diagnostics in the home will be just a part of their portfolio and hopefully, will improve the rate of diagnosing the 936 million people worldwide or just looking at the U.S., the 70 million people in this country that have mild, severe or obstructive sleep apnea that need to be taken care of.

On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our financial results as well as review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals. I will discuss execution highlights against our top 3 strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. 
Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last 1.5 months. During the quarter, demand for ResMed's sleep and respiratory care devices surged dramatically after a competitor's recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain. 
Global supply chain limitations, including a shortage of electronic components as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. Executive teams across automotive, consumer products and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic component shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. 
During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real-world supply chain capacity constraints. In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months. 
We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops. And we begin to open up these supply constraints. We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and most importantly, the ultimate customer, the patient. 
It is a unique time in our industry with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries with these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall, all occurring simultaneously. I want to be clear that, through it all, our priority will always be patience, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it. 
Let me be very clear about a couple of things. One, ResMed's sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. They are the best in the market, they are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. And positive airway pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea. 
And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just 7 weeks ago. They were the #2 player to our #1 leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. We are doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the parts, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain-constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022. 
This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14, so we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team, both internal and external. And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply-constrained, we do see room for expansion of supply ahead. We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters. 
We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials. 
Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022 over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market-leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions. 
Our experience over the last 7-plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand-new next-generation platform called AirSense 11. 
Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow, country by country. But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries. 
Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country, and at the same time, new variants, including the Delta variant, continue to cause disruption in some geographies. Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and health care providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140-plus countries that we operate in. 
A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; 2, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in health care treatment outside the hospital and particularly in the home. These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth. 
We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID-related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter and with some tailwinds from our competitors' recall right at the end of the quarter. 
While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year, with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue. And with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit. And all the while, fighting for recovery of patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians, helping people in 140 countries. 
We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal year 2022. We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well positioned to drive this growth with our health care delivery partners. 
During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow. 
We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter, as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research, all the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. We are reinvesting for long-term growth. 
We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud-connectable medical devices in the market. Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We have to earn it every day with every product, every solution and every service and every customer interaction. Customers vote with their wallets. And right now, they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support. 
Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium- and long-term value, with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs. 
We now have over 9 billion of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir . This app is now cloud-native and serverless in the cloud. This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11. 
The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities, with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture and with support for full cycle teams. And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software as a Service network for out-of-hospital care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers as well as for private and government payers and the communities that they serve. 
Let me now update you on our top 3 strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. 
Last quarter, we previewed our next-gen platform called AirSense 11. Responding to the current industry situation, our market-leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers just this last month; and second, by moving to an earlier full product launch date. We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter and then to other countries gradually over time. 
This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. Previously, we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. We are in a unique situation today. Our market-leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the Airsense 10 at scale, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, APAP and bilevel volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now. 
The bottom line is that we're going to be selling both the Airsense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year, and as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market. And I am understating the results when I say that the response to our controlled product launch has been very positive. AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall health care systems. 
As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market but they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. All AirSense 11devices are 100% cloud-connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers' own health care systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. 
We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mask solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. They were not material to our overall results. They were under $20 million in sales, just under. 
As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and health care systems and the patients they serve in their acute need. But we do not expect the resulting revenue from COVID to be material to our global business. Of course, the broader humanitarian impact is immeasurable, with preservation of life through our ventilation solutions, a top priority in all of these countries. 
Our supply chain focus is for Astral, our life support ventilator; then Stellar, our noninvasive ventilator; and then our Lumis and AirCurve platforms to ensure that we can help patients who need our support the most. 
Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as we see in our sleep apnea business. We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. 
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe this time a year ago. We are now expanding this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been helpful to physicians, not only during the COVID crisis, but it is also increasingly valuable as an ongoing clinical tool for them and for the health care systems that they operate in. 
In summary, we are helping to ensure that digital health is the new standard of care for respiratory care. 
Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital health care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion and life plan communities. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our HME and home health products. And we continue to grow with customers as they utilize and optimize our resupply solutions to improve patient care. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates improve across SNFs and other care settings. We are watching this very closely as COVID peaks and decays in varying rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for our software purchasing that provides opportunities for us to increase our pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease state by state. 
Our leading position as the software provider of choice to the HME market enabled us to help customers manage through the pandemic and to maintain a healthy business. Our Brightree-branded software solutions are allowing HMEs to work through current challenges within our industry, including the need for increased patient support, the need for management of product shortages in some categories as well as ongoing growth in the resupply of much needed home medical equipment. 
As we look across our portfolio of solutions, we expect our SaaS revenue growth to gradually accelerate, increasing from its current mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share from competitors. 
Additionally, we see opportunities on our radar screen to drive growth through further SaaS acquisitions to augment our existing organic growth. We have a good history of thorough due diligence, ensuring that ResMed is the best owner of the asset and, of course, that we can bring additional value for our customers with the new offering. And of course, additional value for all of our shareholders. 
In summary, our SaaS offerings are well received in each of the verticals that we serve, and we see an increasing opportunity to leverage analytics to minimize acute care episodes for residents, patients and clients in our provider network. And ultimately, to allow people to age in place, away from a hospital and preferably in their own homes. 
Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's businesses across both sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative products and solutions. Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. The light shining on the importance of respiratory health and hygiene is brighter than it ever was due to this pandemic. 
COVID has also highlighted the importance of digital health, it's accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis, setup as well as patient monitoring and management. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D to ensure ResMed solutions remain market-leading and provide a catalyst for long-term growth. 
With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in. 
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances. You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffer through COVID. And now you have rapidly pivoted the company back to provide ongoing support for our customers and patients during very challenging industry dynamics and supply chain constraints with unprecedented demand. 
Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will go to Q&A with the whole team. Brett, over to you."
340196,1674147516,2365680,"ResMed Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","ResMed Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are after the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an incre",1408,"Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are after the prior year quarter. 
Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was in turn driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19-impacted reduced levels in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. 
The increased year-over-year demand for our sleep solutions during Q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in COVID-19-related demand for our ventilators and related accessories. 
In the June quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand, primarily in India, was approximately $20 million, a decline of $105 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant currency basis. 
Going forward, we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Note, as a reminder, in Q1 FY '21, we have COVID-19-related incremental revenue of approximately $40 million. 
As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which in turn has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices. We estimate that we generated incremental device revenue of approximately $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter due to our competitors' recall. 
Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $472 million, an increase of 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $308 million, an increase of 11% or an increase of 2% in constant currency terms. 
By product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $268 million, an increase of 30%. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $210 million, an increase of 2% or in constant currency terms, a decrease of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $98 million, an increase of 36% or in constant currency terms, a 24% increase. 
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 12%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 46% in constant currency terms while masks and other sales increased by 16% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. 
Looking forward to FY '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, while we are working hard to increase capacity, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our products compared from our competitor's recall primarily because of supply constraints for electronic components. And we expect these constraints to be more limiting in the first half of FY '22 than the second half. 
As Mick mentioned, we believe component supply constraints as they stand will currently limit incremental device revenue attributable to our competitor's recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million during fiscal year '22. 
During my remaining commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 260 basis points to 57.3% in the June quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to a negative product mix impact, specifically a proportional increase in sales of our lower-margin sleep devices, ASP declines and unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also continued to experience elevated and significant freight costs. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 10%, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to the 21.5% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '22. 
R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 14%, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8%, which is consistent with the prior year. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and digital solutions will deliver sustained competitive advantage. 
Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% during fiscal year '22. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $260 million, an increase of 7%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. 
As I reported last quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million during the previous quarter which was net of credit introductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. During the quarter, we progressed our settlement discussions with the ATO and have refined our tax reserve estimate. As a result, we have determined the required reserve is $249 million or $6 million lower than the previous quarter estimate. And accordingly, we have recorded this as a reduction in our GAAP tax expense in the June quarter. Next steps involve concluding a written agreement with the ATO and obtaining final approvals from each side, which we hope to achieve this quarter. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.4%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '21 was 18.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $198 million, an increase of 3%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35, an increase of 2%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $195 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33. 
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $227 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $28 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. 
We recorded equity losses of $1.3 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Farley joint venture now called Primisyn. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter for fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation. 
We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $295 million. At June 30, we had $655 million in gross debt and $360 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at June 30, we had a further $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. 
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. This represents an increase of 8% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflects the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic, we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health. 
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

And yes, look, it's really exciting to be able to provide $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue for our shareholders, but devices are much needed patients out there over the coming fiscal year. And we actually, we hope to get better than that as we look for more parts and pieces and components, that's our current forecast. 
Look, just breaking down the device numbers for the quarter, really strong device numbers for the U.S. at plus 30%. That was off a comp. If you remember this time a year ago, where sleep devices were weigh down and ventilators were picking up in the U.S., I think it was around plus 1%, the comp, and so a huge turnaround there, plus 30% in this last quarter. And then in EMEA, Asia and rest of world, this time last year, we had plus 35% growth because we had really strong ventilator sales, particularly to some Asia Pacific regions in their COVID crisis. And so that comp of plus 35% was being annualized, and we saw a minus 6% for EMEA, Asia and rest of world. 
So it's a combination, John, of multiple factors of COVID for both those sort of regions, U.S., Canada, Latin America, plus 30% versus EMEA, Asia and rest of world, lapping a plus 30% at their minus 6. So as we project for the $300 million to $350 million, I think that's probably the most guidance we've ever given around an opportunity like this. I'm not going to split that by region or by type or by area. 
But I can tell you, it's supply chain-constrained, not demand-constrained. And everyone in all the 140 countries wants ResMed products. And everyone we make, we sell and we are doing everything we can to drive more and more elements in our supply chain, wherever that bottleneck is in supply. Whatever that part or piece is, I personally, as the CEO, I'm calling up that supplier and talking to their CEO and saying, look, this component can go into a cell phone or a car or it can go into a medical device that literally gives someone the gift of breath, please prioritize our partner supply chain. 
And it's been working these last 7 weeks. We've been able to match $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue. And our goal is to continue every week, every month to do better and better on that."

But what I can say in terms of color, Dan, for your modeling, is that we found out about this 7.5 weeks ago, and we've been working like crazy these last 2 months on the supply chain. And it's easier to open up supply 3 months out, 6 months out, 9 months out. And so a lot of the additional flow of parts and pieces is back-end loaded in the fiscal year. And so much less supply chain-constrained in the March quarter and the June quarter of this fiscal year '22 we're in. 
And it's going to be tougher here. We're already in the September quarter and we're hand to mouth. But look, we're not stockpiling. We're not putting stuff in inventory. We are pushing stuff through plants. Our plants aren't at full capacity, so we have capacity. It's really around components and parts and pieces that are the bottlenecks. And so if you think about that color, it sort of gives you guidance to know that Q3 and Q4 will be a lot less constrained than Q1 and Q2.

So there is a better uptake of ResMed masks with ResMed devices. And certainly, it's going through a channel where there's a salesperson who's providing both of them.

It's 7 years newer in the market, and so there's a lot of upgraded electronic, mechanical, plastic and digital health technology in the device. And so there's a lot of new components as well. 
And yes, there is demand from our competitor out there trying to cover their recall amount as well as catch up with the patients that need urgent replacements. We're not seeing as much of the latter, though. We have a supply chain that has some overlaps with some of our competitors, but actually very individually designed. And as we work through the supply chains, the whole medical device industry is a very small percentage point of the suppliers' total capacity, which is great for us in that we're not fighting for limited share versus a competitor. We're really fighting for share versus a large consumer phone company or an automobile company. 
And the suppliers like medical devices because, firstly, we're relatively recession-resistant. We don't suddenly stop our sales during the recession as some people do on consumer purchases and automotive. And we're usually high-margin for them. So -- and more sustainable growth in terms of what we're doing for our platforms. The AirSense 10 has been in the market for 7 years. And so these are long-term sustainable for them. 
So our arguments are very good with the supply chain, and that's why in the last 7 weeks, we've been able to identify that extra $300 million to $350 million in opportunity. But there is some commonality between our devices. And we will make those trade offs, and that's why we will provide both Airsense 10 and AirSense 11s. But the AirSense 11 is a huge leap forward for the industry, and our goal will be country-by-country to roll that out. But yes, for the next 6, 12 months, there's going to be a lot of selling both the fantastic AirSense 10 and the amazing AirSense 11 in parallel in countries around the world."

I'll address the first half of it, and then I'll hand over to maybe Jim Hollingshead to address some of the latter questions about long term. Firstly, yes, we are focused on new patients as they come through. We're the #1 provider in almost all of the 140 million countries that we're in, but the competitor with this recall was often the #2 to our #1 position. And so there's a lot of demand for new patient flow, and that's where we're focused. That's where we're laser-focused. 
Frankly, it's their job to focus on replacement of recall. That was their job and their duty to go take care of those patients. And we're focused on the new patients. But together will create unprecedented demand in the market. So that's point 1, we're focused on new patients. 
At a high level, as we look out beyond sort of this competitive recall to say what's the steady state as we get to fiscal '23 and towards the end of fiscal 2022, I do think, as I said in the prepared remarks, that we'll achieve a permanent market share increase from this. ResMed has always been the quality leader, always been the clinical leader, always been the smallest, quietest, most comfortable. But there were some customers who have just been used to the old devices from an American brand that was bought by the Dutch company for a long time, and they just stuck with what they had. 
I think they will get a chance to experience the labor cost improvements, the efficiency improvements, the doctors being excited about having full digital on AirView. And patients being excited about the interaction on myAir and the adherence that they get patients happy, physicians happy and provider happy because a happy patient is one who's buying masks because they need them on a replenishment basis. 
So I won't quantify it for you, but I do think there's a magnificent opportunity for us to get our technology in front of a whole new range of customers. On the other hand, we're supply-constrained right now. So we're focused on our existing customers and taking care of them and making sure that we can get the new patients set up for them.

We're introducing at launch a number of innovations. And the platform, because of its connectivity, allows us to introduce even more software innovations post launch on an ongoing basis. 
And so as Mick said in his opening comments, we feel very confident that with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11, we have the 2 best sleep therapy devices on the market. So that was our plan all along. And I think that our competitors' recall simply creates a window of opportunity for us, as Mick is saying, to familiarize more customers, more patients with the innovations and to streamline workflows for providers and to provide -- continually improving patient experience on therapy, which drives up adherence, improves outcomes for patients and all of our stakeholders have been winners with that.

I'll address maybe the first half and hand to Rob Douglas to talk a little bit to that. But look, I can tell you, as CEO, traditionally, I'm taken into discussions with major customers, talking to the large multinational customers around the world and governments that we provide these great therapies and solutions for so that I can engage with them and talk about our great value. 
Right at the moment, I'm not doing that because customer demand is almost infinite. And I'm being taken by my global supply team to talk to suppliers. And Andrew, without naming individuals, I know that individual supplier was named during the COVID crisis at their request, we are going, and I am spending time, not just 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 steps up our supply chain and talking to people who make these basic plastics, electronics and components and parts and pieces and telling them. Sometimes they're unaware that further down the supply chain, there's a life support ventilator or a noninvasive ventilator or a sleep apnea device that cures and treats sleep suffocation. 
And so just getting me that opportunity. Firstly, it's very interesting for me. It's a new dynamic, and we're getting really good response from these suppliers. They also are under difficult supply chain conditions and often ask me to go with them further up the supply chain to talk to someone else. And it's a game of sort of bottleneck, debottlenecking, if you like, in the global supply chain. We have a very advanced engineering team that are looking all day every day in our global supply alliance internally led by Linda Ladar and her team and Andrew Price and his team, and they are pulling me in and doing much more themselves all day, every day to drive that. 
So it's an ongoing opportunity for us. It's a supply chain opportunity that's unique due to COVID, impacts on freight costs, impacts on freight availability, but also the growth that we see ahead due to this unique situation. Rob, any more color to talk about there on our supply chain to Andrew's question?"

One is, after following on from COVID last year when we rapidly ramped ventilation, usually for that ramp, you've got to put in longer term commitments. So we did have actually a lot of commitments on the ventilator devices going forward, and that will be helpful for us. As Mick said, we can always make a better case than a cyclical consumer product. And in fact, one of the key factors around that, not only are we saving lives, but also for these suppliers, we can give them very long-term forecast that we usually hit and do really well. 
So we're able to give long-term forecast, and we know they like that and they can plan that in. The forecast is stable. It's unusual to have the sort of sudden increment that we've had as a result of recent industry events. And so we're putting that in and pulling stuff forward. But also given that just the number of patients we've got to treat and where we are in the market, we're able to make some really solid long-term commitments with these suppliers as well. And so that really, really helps. 
And we will see our commitment horizon actually had go quite a lot longer than what traditionally it's been. And then the other fact that Mick mentioned briefly also is we've got a really strong design team. And where there are sort of acute bottlenecks on particular components, we can forward design around those, but those design changes do take time and they've got to be properly validated and tested, and we have very rigorous testing on these products. So we can't just rapidly switch to a new component, but we can plan some months out that we'll be able to add in additional sources of components. So as you can imagine, this is sort of full-court press for our supply chain and engineering teams, and they're going flat out on this."

And Rob, if he wants to chime in as well. Look, this is an unprecedented time. Before our competitor made this announcement 7 weeks ago, there was already constraints in the market around some of the components. And certainly, because of nobody traveling really internationally, consumer travel is down so much and all the freight in the back of those consumer jets was gone, the costs were higher. 
And look, we talked about this 90 days ago on our last earnings call, and you saw it in the COGS numbers for this June quarter. And that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, these costs aren't going away. It is more costly to get freight than it was because there's much less planes available. And it is with scarce components. Although we have very long-term contracts, prices are being impacted by that. 
At the same time, we're in an environment where we have customers with contracts with payers and the consumer side of our business, there might be some opportunity to work with the supply chain to think about how to get some of those costs through the channel. But certainly, in the reimbursed side of the market, it's a balance. And you've got to think really long term about on the other side of this crisis, how are we and our customers are going to engage in our long-term interactions. And so it's a complex equation. And -- but Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to what we're doing to negotiate to achieve the best prices that we can get and to manage our gross margin there and the COGS there? And maybe Jim, talked to how we're working with customers on long-term pricing. So Brett and then Jim."

So I think over the course of the year, you'd expect some, I think, some increases on those components there. But we can mitigate that to some extent with some of these longer-term contractual arrangements. 
So that is a pressure point, if you like, on our cost side. And then freight definitely, as Mick mentioned, that remains pretty elevated and for a number of reasons, and just really even getting slots and so on, that's air freight. That's even in even containers now for sea freight even. So that, I think, will continue some for -- probably for this year. 
But that you think -- I don't think the freight is going to be a put. I think that will resolve itself over time, but I think for the -- over the course of this fiscal, I think that's going to remain as a cost pressure for us."

But if you think of our industry, it's historically been a price down industry, right? And that's because reimbursements come down and prices come down because, ,we, as manufacturers have been able to drive down billed materials and move the industry in that direction while preserving margins. 
Our customers still are very constrained on their ability to pass on any price increases that they face. Because for the most part, they're in -- either have government reimbursement or they have some sort of contracted reimbursement with a commercial payer. And those reimbursements have remained static or come down over time. 
So as we think about what we might be able to do pass price forward, we have to be very thoughtful about how we accomplish that and if we can do it. And then couple that with the fact that we are also in contract with most of our customers, right? So we might be in a tender contract with a government payer or many of our larger customers, we have contracts that run for 12 months that have a renewal cycle and that sort of thing. So I think that we've done a very good job of being disciplined in pricing and maintaining price stability and we'll be very, very thoughtful as we think about any kind of price changes that we do over time.

And so those are contracts we're working through in real time, but they're not uncapped at discounts. And we're managing those conversations, I think, very carefully.

There certainly was some confusion after the June 14 announcement, but I think many of the regulatory authorities and many of the clinician groups came out pretty quickly to say, let's talk to your doctor and work out a risk pathway between now and when you get that replacement device from that competitor. And also for new patients, the doctors and certainly all of us in the industry were very focused on the safe and effective therapies from ResMed and other players in the market. 
And so I think that messaging was actually pretty quickly put out there by those physician societies and relevant health authorities after somewhat confusing announcements, right, on that June 14 from our competitor. And so long term, there's been some impacts that are quite beneficial in patients making that trade-off. And certainly, for us, yes, you saw a plus 5% growth in masks in the quarter for the U.S. You saw plus 24% growth in Europe over a COVID comp there, but very, very solid growth in our mass business. 
As you said, there's a bunch of factors, David. This time last year, we had all the ventilation mask sales for COVID in the U.S., which was a comp that we were -- was like a headwind. And the other headwind we had was the annualization of the Snap acquisition, which we did just before COVID. We closed it just in that sort of February through June period. And then there's some balancing of inventory and cash flow due to the competitive recall, all going on at once. 
And so a lot of competing dynamics. But as you saw, it's a resilient business when people are getting great sleep apnea therapy. They love feeling better, sleeping well and waking up refreshed, and they want to get a new mask every 3 or 6 months. And they're doing it at increasing rates due to COVID. That step-change has remained. And we're confident as we look through the fiscal year that we're going to see mid-single-digit up to high single-digit growth in our mask business. 
And it's all about us engaging with those patients, getting new patients on board. As we talked about, some incremental revenue opportunities there on the devices, maybe some on the masks. And then we get back to where we were before, right? And we go back to engaging patients, ensuring they stay on therapy, and they have really quick and easy access to resupply if they want it and when they want it and when it's covered by insurance and co-pays and everything."

Yes. Firstly, the joint venture with Verily, its name now is. And so we've got the branding out there. And we have Jonathan, a fantastic CEO that comes to us from Edwards Life Sciences and other large med tech companies that he's been a part of and really exciting to have a new CEO there.

And so great to have a new leader and new opportunity. 
The milestones are really around those MSAs and the success we're having before we'll scale. And obviously, given the current industry dynamics, we don't need to drive demand right now. We have unprecedented, almost unlimited demand but we're doing lots of pilots and lots of testing. And I can see, as we get towards our 2023 and we annualize all this and we're moving towards our 2025 strategy, that previous Sun joint venture will create incredible opportunities to identify and engage and enroll the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate and want to find a pathway to treatment for their sleep apnea.

And like a lot of -- a number of things over the last 18 months, the headwinds for Propeller were largely driven by their customer base focusing on COVID. So a big part of Propeller's business is working with payers and with health systems to drive adoption of their digital solutions. And there was just distraction in their customer base for many months, obviously. 
So we're starting to see some more traction in those conversations as COVID starts to decline and the market start to stabilize. And we've taken the opportunity during that span to do -- to continue to develop our capabilities in Propeller. And I would say -- just a couple of highlights, I would say, we've added quite a lot of muscle to the commercial side of that business by adding talent into the business. And we've also been working hard behind the scenes to build out the cloud architecture and make sure that Propellers cloud architecture is paired up really nicely in matching and kind of aligned with ResMed's overall cloud architecture for our other digital offerings. And all of that kind of investment is just going to accelerate Propeller's traction in the market as we continue to accelerate digital offerings across our entire portfolio. 
So we're very excited about it. I think that material revenues out of Propeller are a couple of years away in all likelihood. But as we get more milestones and new things like signed contracts, we'll keep everybody apprised."

On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our financial results as well as review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals. I will discuss execution highlights against our top 3 strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results.
Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last 1.5 months. During the quarter, demand for ResMed's sleep and respiratory care devices surged dramatically after a competitor's recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain.
Global supply chain limitations, including a shortage of electronic components, as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. Executive teams across automotive, consumer products and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic component shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices.
During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real-world supply chain capacity constraints. In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months.
We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops and we begin to open up these supply constraints. We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and most importantly, the ultimate customer, the patient.
It is a unique time in our industry with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries with these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall all occurring simultaneously. I want to be clear that, through it all, our priority will always be patience, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it.
Let me be very clear about a couple of things. One, ResMed's sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. They are the best in the market. They are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. And positive airway pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea.
And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just 7 weeks ago. They were the #2 player to our #1 leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. We are doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the parts, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain-constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022.
This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14, so we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team, both internal and external. And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply-constrained, we do see room for expansion of supply ahead. We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters.
We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials.
Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022, over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market-leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions.
Our experience over the last 7-plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand-new next-generation platform called AirSense 11.
Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow country by country. But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries.
Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country, and at the same time, new variants, including the Delta variant, continue to cause disruption in some geographies. Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and health care providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140-plus countries that we operate in.
A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in health care treatment outside the hospital and particularly in the home. These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth.
We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID-related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter and with some tailwinds from our competitors' recall right at the end of the quarter.
While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year, with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit, and all the while, fighting for recovery of patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians, helping people in 140 countries.
We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal year 2022. We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well-positioned to drive this growth with our health care delivery partners.
During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow.
We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research, all the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. We are reinvesting for long-term growth.
We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud-connectable medical devices in the market. Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We have to earn it every day with every product, every solution and every service and every customer interaction. Customers vote with their wallets. And right now, they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support.
Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium- and long-term value with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs.
We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir. This app is now cloud-native and serverless in the cloud. This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11.
The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities, with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture and with support for full-cycle teams. And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software as a Service network for out-of-hospital care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers as well as for private and government payers and the communities that they serve.
Let me now update you on our top 3 strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home.
Last quarter, we previewed our next-gen platform called AirSense 11. Responding to the current industry situation, our market-leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers just this last month; and second, by moving to an earlier full product launch date. We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter and then to other countries gradually over time.
This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. Previously, we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. We are in a unique situation today. Our market-leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at scale, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, APAP and bilevel volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now.
The bottom line is that we're going to be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year and as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market. And I am understating the results when I say that the response to our controlled product launch has been very positive. AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners, and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall health care systems.
As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market, but they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud-connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and adherence, to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers' own health care systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings.
We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mask solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. They were not material to our overall results. They were under $20 million in sales, just under.
As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and health care systems and the patients that they serve in their acute need. But we do not expect the resulting revenue from COVID to be material to our global business. Of course, the broader humanitarian impact is immeasurable, with preservation of life through our ventilation solutions a top priority in all of these countries.
Our supply chain focus is for Astral, our life support ventilator; then Stellar, our noninvasive ventilator; and then our Lumis and AirCurve platforms to ensure that we can help patients who need our support the most.
Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as we see in our sleep apnea business. We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs.
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe this time a year ago. We are now expanding this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been helpful to physicians, not only during the COVID crisis, but it is also increasingly valuable as an ongoing clinical tool for them and for the health care systems that they operate in.
In summary, we are helping to ensure that digital health is the new standard of care for respiratory care.
Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital health care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion and life plan communities. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our HME and home health products. And we continue to grow with customers as they utilize and optimize our resupply solutions to improve patient care.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities or SNFs. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates improve across SNFs and other care settings. We are watching this very closely as COVID peaks and decays at varying rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for our software purchasing that provides opportunities for us to increase our pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease state by state.
Our leading position as the software provider of choice to the HME market enabled us to help customers manage through the pandemic and to maintain a healthy business. Our Brightree-branded software solutions are allowing HMEs to work through current challenges within our industry, including the need for increased patient support, the need for management of product shortages in some categories as well as ongoing growth in the resupply of much needed home medical equipment. 
As we look across our portfolio of solutions, we expect our SaaS revenue growth to gradually accelerate, increasing from its current mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share from competitors.
Additionally, we see opportunities on our radar screen to drive growth through further SaaS acquisitions to augment our existing organic growth. We have a good history of thorough due diligence, ensuring that ResMed is the best owner of the asset and, of course, that we can bring additional value for our customers with the new offering and of course, additional value for all of our shareholders.
In summary, our SaaS offerings are well received in each of the verticals that we serve, and we see an increasing opportunity to leverage analytics to minimize acute care episodes for residents, patients and clients in our provider network; and ultimately, to allow people to age in place, away from a hospital and preferably in their own homes.
Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's businesses across both sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative products and solutions. Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. The light shining on the importance of respiratory health and hygiene is brighter than it ever was due to this pandemic.
COVID has also highlighted the importance of digital health, its accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis, setup as well as patient monitoring and management. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D to ensure ResMed solutions remain market-leading and provide a catalyst for long-term growth.
With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in.
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances. You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffered through COVID. And now you have rapidly pivoted the company back to provide ongoing support for our customers and patients during very challenging industry dynamics and supply chain constraints with unprecedented demand.
Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will go to Q&A with the whole team. Brett, over to you."
340196,1674147516,2366043,"ResMed Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","ResMed Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase",1410,"Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.
Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was, in turn, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19-impacted reduced levels in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors.
The increased year-over-year demand for our sleep solutions during Q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in COVID-19-related demand for our ventilators and related accessories.
In the June quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand, primarily in India, was approximately $20 million, a decline of $105 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant currency basis.
Going forward, we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Note, as a reminder, in Q1 FY '21, we have COVID-19-related incremental revenue of approximately $40 million.
As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which, in turn, has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices. We estimate that we generated incremental device revenue of approximately $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter due to our competitors' recall.
Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $472 million, an increase of 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $308 million, an increase of 11% or an increase of 2% in constant currency terms.
By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $268 million, an increase of 30%. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $210 million, an increase of 2% or in constant currency terms, a decrease of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $98 million, an increase of 36% or in constant currency terms, a 24% increase.
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 12%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 46% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 16% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter.
Looking forward to fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, while we are working hard to increase capacity, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our products compared from our competitor's recall primarily because of supply constraints for electronic components. And we expect these constraints to be more limiting in the first half of FY '22 than the second half.
As Mick mentioned, we believe component supply constraints as they stand will currently limit incremental device revenue attributable to our competitor's recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million during fiscal year '22.
During my remaining commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.
Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 260 basis points to 57.3% in the June quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to a negative product mix impact, specifically a proportional increase in sales of our lower-margin sleep devices, ASP declines and unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also continued to experience elevated and significant freight costs.
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 10%, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to the 21.5% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '22.
R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 14%, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8%, which is consistent with the prior year. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and digital solutions will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% during fiscal year '22.
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $260 million, an increase of 7%, underpinned by strong revenue growth.
As I reported last quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million during the previous quarter, which was net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office or ATO. During the quarter, we progressed our settlement discussions with the ATO and have refined our tax reserve estimate. As a result, we have determined the required reserve is $249 million or $6 million lower than the previous quarter estimate. And accordingly, we have recorded this as a reduction in our GAAP tax expense in the June quarter. Next steps involve concluding a written agreement with the ATO and obtaining final approvals from each side, which we hope to achieve this quarter.
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.4%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '21 was 18.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%.
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $198 million, an increase of 3%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35, an increase of 2%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $195 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $227 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $28 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.
We recorded equity losses of $1.3 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Verily joint venture now called Primasun. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter for fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation.
We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $295 million. At June 30, we had $655 million in gross debt and $360 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at June 30, we had a further $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong.
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. This represents an increase of 8% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic, we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health.
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

And we -- a",413,"Yes. Thanks for the question, John. And yes, look, it's really exciting to be able to provide $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue for our shareholders, but devices are much needed patients out there over the coming fiscal year. And we -- actually, we hope to get better than that as we look for more parts and pieces and components. That's our current forecast.
Look, just breaking down the device numbers for the quarter, really strong device numbers for the U.S. at plus 30%. That was off a comp. If you remember this time a year ago, where sleep devices were weighed down and ventilators were picking up in the U.S., I think it was around plus 1%, the comp, and so a huge turnaround there, plus 30% in this last quarter. And then in EMEA, Asia and rest of world, this time last year, we had plus-35% growth because we had really strong ventilator sales, particularly to some Asia Pacific regions in their COVID crises. And so that comp of plus 35% was being annualized, and we saw a minus 6% for EMEA, Asia and rest of world.
So it's a combination, John, of multiple factors of COVID for both those sort of regions, U.S., Canada, Latin America, plus 30% versus EMEA, Asia and rest of world, lapping a plus 30% at their minus 6%. So as we project for the $300 million to $350 million, I think that's probably the most guidance we've ever given around an opportunity like this. I'm not going to split that by region or by type or by area. But I can tell you, it's supply chain-constrained, not demand-constrained.
And everyone in all the 140 countries wants ResMed products. And every one we make, we sell, and we are doing everything we can to drive more and more elements in our supply chain, wherever that bottleneck is in supply. Whatever that part or piece is, I personally, as the CEO, I'm calling up that supplier and talking to their CEO and saying, ""Look, this component can go into a cell phone or a car or it can go into a medical device that literally gives someone the gift of breath, please prioritize our partner supply chain."" And it's been working these last 7 weeks. We've been able to match $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue. And our goal is to continue every week, every month to do better and better on that."

But what I can say, in terms of color, Dan, for your modeling, is that we found out about this 7.5 weeks ago, and we've been working like crazy these last 2 months on the supply chain. And it's easier to open up supply 3 months out, 6 months out, 9 months out. And so a lot of the additional flow of parts and pieces is back-end loaded in the fiscal year. And so much less supply chain-constrained in the March quarter and the June quarter of this fiscal year '22 we're in. 
And it's going to be tougher here. We're already in the September quarter, and we're hand to mouth. But look, we're not stockpiling. We're not putting stuff in inventory. We are pushing stuff through plants. Our plants aren't at full capacity, so we have capacity. It's really around components and parts and pieces that are the bottlenecks. And so if you think about that color, it sort of gives you guidance to know that Q3 and Q4 will be a lot less constrained than Q1 and Q2. Q2 should be slightly better than Q1, and Q3 should be significantly better than Q2, and Q4 should be significantly better than Q2 and Q1 as well."

It's sort of trying to get to the understanding of how much incremental mask share we might get when they're on a ResMed device. So look, as you know, it's an open system, and there's no requirement that a ResMed device has a ResMed mask. They are designed by the same engineers in the same building out there in Sydney and the manufacturing -- advanced manufacturing site across the road. So they're designed to work together very well, and they are better together.
So there is a better uptake of ResMed masks with ResMed devices. And certainly, it's going through a channel where there's a salesperson who's providing both of them. And so there's some opportunities on both the sort of clinical and technical side as well as the commercial and execution side for some incremental growth. I won't quantify that for you, but I do think there is some upside."

It's 7 years newer in the market, and so there's a lot of upgraded electronic, mechanical, plastic and digital health technology in the device. And so there's a lot of new components as well.
And yes, there is demand from our competitor out there trying to cover their recall amount as well as -- and catch up with the patients that need urgent replacements. We're not seeing as much of the latter, though. We have a supply chain that has some overlaps with some of our competitors but actually very individually designed. And as we work through the supply chains, the whole medical device industry is a very small percentage point of the suppliers' total capacity, which is great for us in that we're not fighting for limited share versus a competitor. We're really fighting for share versus a large consumer phone company or an automobile company.
And the suppliers like medical devices because, firstly, we're relatively recession-resistant. We don't suddenly stop our sales during a recession as some people do on consumer purchases and automotive. And we're usually high-margin for them, so -- and more sustainable growth in terms of what we're doing for our platforms. The AirSense 10 has been in the market for 7 years, and so these are long-term sustainable for them.
So our arguments are very good with the supply chain, and that's why in the last 7 weeks, we've been able to identify that extra $300 million to $350 million in opportunity. But there is some commonality between our devices. And we will make those trade-offs, and that's why we will provide both AirSense 10 and AirSense 11s. But the AirSense 11 is a huge leap forward for the industry, and our goal will be country by country to roll that out. But yes, for the next 6, 12 months, there's going to be a lot of selling both the fantastic AirSense 10 and the amazing AirSense 11 in parallel in countries around the world."

I'll address the first half of it, and then I'll hand over to maybe Jim Hollingshead to address some of the latter questions about long term. Firstly, yes, we are focused on new patients as they come through. We're the #1 provider in almost all of the 140 million countries that we're in, but the competitor with this recall was often the #2 to our #1 position. And so there's a lot of demand for new patient flow, and that's where we're focused. That's where we're laser-focused.
Frankly, it's their job to focus on replacement of recall. That was their job and their duty to go take care of those patients. And we're focused on the new patients. Both together will create unprecedented demand in the market. So that's Point 1, we're focused on new patients.
At a high level, as we look out beyond sort of this competitive recall to say what's the steady state as we get to fiscal '23 and towards the end of fiscal 2022, I do think, as I said in the prepared remarks, that we'll achieve a permanent market share increase from this. ResMed has always been the quality leader, always been the clinical leader, always been the smallest, quietest, most comfortable. But there were some customers who have just been used to the old devices from an American brand that was bought by the Dutch company for a long time, and they just stuck with what they had.
I think they will get a chance to experience the labor cost improvements, the efficiency improvements, the doctors being excited about having full digital on AirView and patients being excited about the interaction on myAir and the adherence that they get patients happy, physicians happy and provider happy. Because a happy patient is one who's buying masks because they need them on a replenishment basis.
So I won't quantify it for you, but I do think this is a magnificent opportunity for us to get our technology in front of a whole new range of customers. On the other hand, we're supply-constrained right now. So we're focused on our existing customers and taking care of them and making sure that we can get the new patients set up for them.
But Jim, any other color you think on sort of changes to the market conditions and longer-term implications?"

Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Maggie, for your question. I would say on long term, as we were preparing to launch AirSense 11, our plan was to take market share, to take device share with the offering because the AirSense 11 offering both the device and the software, we think, is by far the best offering on the market. We're introducing at launch a number of innovations. And the platform, because of its connectivity, allows us to introduce even more software innovations post launch on an ongoing basis.
And so as Mick said in his opening comments, we feel very confident that with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11, we have the 2 best sleep therapy devices on the market. So that was our plan all along. And I think that our competitor's recall simply creates a window of opportunity for us, as Mick is saying, to familiarize more customers, more patients with the innovations and to streamline workflows for providers and to provide -- continually improving patient experience on therapy, which drives up adherence, improves outcomes for patients, and all of our stakeholders have been winners with that. So we feel very confident as we were launching, and I think the circumstances give us even more of an opportunity."

I'll address maybe the first half and hand to Rob Douglas to talk a little bit to that. But look, I can tell you, as CEO, traditionally, I'm taken into discussions with major customers, talking to the large multinational customers around the world and governments that we provide these great therapies and solutions for, so that I can engage with them and talk about our great value. Right at the moment, I'm not doing that because customer demand is almost infinite. And I'm being taken by my global supply team to talk to suppliers.
And Andrew, without naming individuals, I know that individual supplier was named during the COVID crisis at their request, we are going, and I am spending time, not just 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 steps up our supply chain and talking to people who make these basic plastics, electronics and components and parts and pieces and telling them. Sometimes they're unaware that further down the supply chain, there's a life support ventilator or a noninvasive ventilator or a sleep apnea device that cures and treats sleep suffocation.
And so just getting me that opportunity. Firstly, it's very interesting for me. It's a new dynamic, and we're getting really good response from these suppliers. They also are under difficult supply chain conditions and often ask me to go with them further up the supply chain to talk to someone else. And it's a game of sort of bottleneck, debottlenecking, if you like, in the global supply chain. We have a very advanced engineering team that are looking all day every day in our global supply alliance internally, led by Linda Laidlaw and her team and Andrew Price and his team, and they are pulling me in and doing much more themselves all day, every day to drive that.
So it's an ongoing opportunity for us. It's a supply chain opportunity that's unique due to COVID impacts on freight costs, impacts on freight availability but also the growth that we see ahead due to this unique situation.
Rob, any more color to talk about there on our supply chain for -- to Andrew's question?"

One is, after following on from COVID last year when we rapidly ramped ventilation, usually, for that ramp, you've got to put in longer-term commitments. So we did have actually a lot of commitments on the ventilator devices going forward, and that will be helpful for us. As Mick said, we can always make a better case than a cyclical consumer product. And in fact, one of the key factors around that, not only are we saving lives, but also for these suppliers, we can give them very long-term forecast that we usually hit and do really well.
So we're able to give long-term forecast, and we know they like that and they can plan that in. The forecast is stable. It's unusual to have the sort of sudden increment that we've had as a result of recent industry events. And so we're putting that in and pulling stuff forward. But also given that just the number of patients we've got to treat and where we are in the market, we're able to make some really solid long-term commitments with these suppliers as well. And so that really, really helps. And we will see our commitment horizon actually had go quite a lot longer than what traditionally it's been.
And then the other fact that Mick mentioned briefly also is we've got a really strong design team. And where there are sort of acute bottlenecks on particular components, we can forward design around those, but those design changes do take time. And they've got to be properly validated and tested, and we have very rigorous testing on these products. So we can't just rapidly switch to a new component, but we can plan some months out that we'll be able to add in additional sources of components. So as you can imagine, this is sort of full-court press for our supply chain and engineering teams, and they're going flat out on this."

I'll hand to Brett to talk a little bit around the costs and how we're taking care of those, and Rob, if he wants to chime in as well. Look, this is an unprecedented time. Before our competitor made this announcement 7 weeks ago, there was already constraints in the market around some of the components. And certainly, because of nobody traveling really internationally, consumer travel is down so much, and all the freight in the back of those consumer jets was gone. The costs were higher.
And look, we talked about this 90 days ago on our last earnings call, and you saw it in the COGS numbers for this June quarter. And that's going to be with us for a while. I mean these costs aren't going away. It is more costly to get freight than it was because there's much less planes available. And it is with scarce components. Although we have very long-term contracts, prices are being impacted by that.
At the same time, we're in an environment where we have customers with contracts with payers, and in the consumer side of our business, there might be some opportunity to work with the supply chain to think about how to get some of those costs through the channel. But certainly, in the reimbursed side of the market, it's a balance. And you've got to think really long term about on the other side of this crisis, how are we and our customers are going to engage in our long-term interactions. And so it's a complex equation.
And -- but Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to what we're doing to negotiate to achieve the best prices that we can get and to manage our gross margin there and the COGS there? And maybe, Jim, talk to how we're working with customers on long-term pricing. So Brett and then Jim."

But we can mitigate that to some extent with some of these longer-term contractual arrangements. So that is a pressure point, if you like, on our cost side.
And then freight, definitely, as Mick mentioned, that remains pretty elevated and for a number of reasons, and just really even getting swaps and so on, that's air freight, that's even into -- even containers now for a sea freight even. So that, I think, will continue some for -- probably for this year. But that you think -- I don't think the freight is going to be approved. I think that will resolve itself over time.

But I -- if you think of our industry, it's historically been a price-down industry, right? And that's because reimbursements come down and prices come down because, we, as manufacturers, have been able to drive down [ below ] materials and move the industry in that direction while preserving margins.
Our customers still are very constrained on their ability to pass on any price increases that they face. Because for the most part, they're in -- either have government reimbursement or they have some sort of contracted reimbursement with a commercial payer. And those reimbursements have remained static or come down over time.
So as we think about what we might be able to do pass price forward, we have to be very thoughtful about how we accomplish that and if we can do it. And then couple that with the fact that we are also in contract with most of our customers, right? So we might be in a tender contract with a government payer or many of our larger customers, we have contracts that run for 12 months that have a renewal cycle and that sort of thing.

And also, for new patients, the doctors and certainly, all of us in the industry were very focused on the safe and effective therapies from ResMed and other players in the market.
And so I think that messaging was actually pretty quickly put out there by those physician societies and relevant health authorities after somewhat confusing announcements, right, on that June 14 from our competitor. And so long term, there's been some impacts that are quite beneficial in patients making that trade-off. And certainly, for us, yes, you saw a plus-5% growth in masks in the quarter for the U.S. You saw a plus-24% growth in Europe over a COVID comp there, but very, very solid growth in our mask business.
As you said, there's a bunch of factors, David. This time last year, we had all the ventilation mask sales for COVID in the U.S., which was a comp that we were -- was like a headwind. And the other headwind we had was the annualization of the Snap acquisition, which we did just before COVID. We closed it just in that sort of February through June period. And then there's some balancing of inventory and cash flow due to the competitive recall, all going on at once. And so a lot of competing dynamics.
But as you saw, it's a resilient business. When people are getting great sleep apnea therapy, they love feeling better, sleeping well and waking up refreshed, and they want to get a new mask every 3 or 6 months. And they're doing it at increasing rates due to COVID. That step-change has remained. And we're confident as we look through the fiscal year that we're going to see mid-single-digit up to high single-digit growth in our mask business.
And it's all about us engaging with those patients, getting new patients onboard. As we talked about, some incremental revenue opportunities there on the devices, maybe some on the masks. And then we get back to where we were before, right? And we go back to engaging patients, ensuring they stay on therapy, and they have really quick and easy access to resupply if they want it and when they want it and when it's covered by insurance and co-pays and everything."

And it's great to have a question that's sort of looking out beyond the next 12 months given the dynamics. I'm not surprised by that. I'll take the first part on the joint venture with Verily and hand to Jim to talk a little bit more about Verily and also about Propeller and other great development opportunities we have across our portfolio in sleep and respiratory care.
Yes, firstly, the joint venture with Verily, its name now is Primasun. And so we've got the branding out there. And we have Jonathan Lobbins, a fantastic CEO, that comes to us from Edwards Lifesciences and other large med tech companies that he's been a part of and really exciting to have a new CEO there. He's a strong leader. And the ability to identify, engage and enroll, what I call, sleep-concerned consumers into a digital pathway and a treatment pathway for sleep apnea is incredible and some really good experiments happening in certain metropolitan and statistical areas with that technology. And so great to have a new leader and new opportunity.
The milestones are really around those MSAs and the success we're having before we'll scale. And obviously, given the current industry dynamics, we don't need to drive demand right now. We have unprecedented, almost unlimited demand, but we're doing lots of pilots and lots of testing. And I can see, as we get towards our 2023 and we annualize all this and we're moving towards our 2025 strategy, that Primasun joint venture will create incredible opportunities to identify and engage and enroll the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate and want to find a pathway to treatment for their sleep apnea.
Jim, any other thoughts about Primasun or Propeller or any other great developments you've got on the horizon in SRC?"

And like a lot of -- a number of things over the last 18 months, the headwinds for Propeller were largely driven by their customer base focusing on COVID. So a big part of Propeller's business is working with payers and with health systems to drive adoption of their digital solutions. And there was just distraction in their customer base for many months, obviously.
So we're starting to see some more traction in those conversations as COVID starts to decline and the market starts to stabilize. And we've taken the opportunity during that span to do -- to continue to develop our capabilities in Propeller. And I would say -- just a couple of highlights, I would say, we've added quite a lot of muscle to the commercial side of that business by adding talent into the business. And we've also been working hard behind the scenes to build out the cloud architecture and make sure that Propeller's cloud architecture is paired up really nicely and matching and kind of aligned with ResMed's overall cloud architecture for our other digital offerings. And all of that kind of investment is just going to accelerate Propeller's traction in the market as we continue to accelerate digital offerings across our entire portfolio.
So we're very excited about it. I think that material revenues out of Propeller are a couple of years away in all likelihood. But as we get more milestones and new things like signed contracts, we'll keep everybody apprised."

Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by ext",2429,"Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as continuing recovery of many markets from COVID-19. We achieved double-digit growth at both the top and bottom line metrics of our business. I want to be clear that achieving these results has not been easy this quarter. We are dealing with an unprecedented what I would call perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery, but also including a competitor recall that's -- a recall that's tenfold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. 
I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24/7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As the market leader, our competitor, that is in the #2 market share position, announced a recall mid-June that has created unprecedented dislocations in the market. In effect, we are facing the challenge of providing the volume for our own #1 market share position and also trying to meet as much of their #2 market share position as possible around the world. 
Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products, namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. 
As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We achieved our goal with that manufacturer. And we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge and are still facing it of working with the 5 customers of theirs, all the way down that chain to get to us to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. 
The supply chain analysis and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very fluid, changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7. In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips that ultimately limit our net production output. 
In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of seafreight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to distribution warehouses and ultimately, the customers are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. 
We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders as the situation develops. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and the most important customer, the patient. 
Our #1 priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, for COPD, for asthma and for other chronic respiratory diseases as well as critical out-of-hospital care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need, where they need it and when they need it. 
Let's now discuss the overall market conditions in our industry. We are seeing a steady ongoing recovery of demand in the countries that we operate in. They remain at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of new patient flow. We are still seeing a divergence in total patient flow and sleep lab capacity from 75% to 95% of pre-COVID levels in some countries, up to 100% plus of pre-COVID levels in others. These metrics will continue to ebb and flow as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and as new variants of the coronavirus arise and cause temporary perturbations. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply the ventilators, the masks and the training for acute care and the transition home for affected patients. 
Let me now update you on our 3 strategic priorities as we pivot back to grow our core business. These 3 are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. 
In August, we launched our next-generation device platform that we call AirSense 11 into the United States market. In short, that launch has been very successful. We will be introducing the AirSense 11 into additional countries very soon. Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers, and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. 
Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP APAP and by levels available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. It's still early into the SirSense 11 launch, but initial customer feedback, combined with the detailed responses to our controlled product launch, tells me that the AirSense 11 is another success for ResMed. 
Physician, provider and patient feedback are all very positive. I was able to attend the California Sleep Society meeting in person, actually, during the quarter, and I was able to observe firsthand the responses to the latest innovations on the AirSense 11, such as personal therapy assistant, care check-in and the incredible rate of uptake of the patient-centric app called myAir, which has been upgraded for AirSense 11. And the uptake on that is almost double what it was for the myAir app than the AirSense 10. 
What's clear to me is that this platform, the AirSense 11, benefits not only patients and their bed partners, in addition, the device and software combination benefits physicians, it benefits providers and it benefits payers as well as entire health care systems with more data, more insights and better outcomes. 
As a 2-way digital health comms platform with many technical features that represent significant therapeutic advances, AirSense 11 is not only easy to set up and use, it also offers a very rich patient-centric experience. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology that is able to increase patient adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within health care providers and physicians own health systems. We are engaging with patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. This is a critical part of the ResMed 2025 strategy, as presented at our Investor Day, which we held virtually during this last quarter. 
Another key aspect of our long-term growth is linked to the awareness and the increasing flow of sleep apnea patients. With 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, this work is critical to our mission. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and remote care, including home-based sleep apnea tests. We want to support seamless and cost-effective approaches to sleep diagnostics. We want to scale technology that in our consumer markets enables an easy-to-use device experience and technology that, in our reimbursed markets, can be a low-cost, clinically reliable, screening tool for sleep apnea. 
In this vein, on October 1, we closed a transaction to acquire EctoSense, a leader in cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology from Belgium. We believe EctoSense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of both physicians and sleep lab technicians as well as consumers can help significantly increase sleep apnea diagnosis rates as well as general sleep awareness. EctoSense will operate within our sleep and  respiratory care business unit, and we're excited to bring this innovative technology to more global markets as we move forward. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our long-term goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. 
Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and beyond was strong throughout the quarter. especially in markets outside the United States where physicians and providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with our strategy to ensure priority for manufacturing and delivery of the devices that meets the needs of those patients, specifically those that need life support ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, including by level support, first. 
We are balancing the growth in the respiratory care demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the coronavirus pandemic as well as customers as they balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. 
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been very helpful to physicians not only during COVID, but it is increasingly valuable on an ongoing basis for them and the health care systems that they operate in. 
In the not-too-distant future, I can see AirView becoming standard of care for patients on home-based ventilation protocols in many health care systems. 
Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment as well as facility-based and home-based care settings. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with customers as they utilize our software and data solutions, including Brightree and SnapWorx supply to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates of patients improve across SNFs and other facility-based care settings. We will continue to watch this closely as covered cases ebb and flow at slower and slower rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for technology investments in these SaaS verticals, which provides opportunities for us to increase our new customer pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease. 
As we look at our portfolio of software solutions, we expect SaaS revenue to accelerate, increasing from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are uniquely positioned, and we have created differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. 
Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. 
We are transforming out-of-hospital care at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology. With over 10 billion nights now, 10 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 15.5 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value from these data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. 
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with COVID-19, with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now and you have now already pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all of our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry. 
Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open the call up for Q&A. Brett?"

In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase",1370,"Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. 
Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. 
In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the September '21 and September '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 25% on a constant currency basis. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. 
In relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $80 million to $90 million in the September quarter. 
Taking a look at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $491 million, an increase of 22%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $315 million, an increase of 23% and or an increase of 21% in constant currency terms. 
By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $276 million, an increase of 40%. Masks and other sales were $215 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $218 million, an increase of 24% or in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $97 million, an increase of 21% or in constant currency terms, an 18% increase. 
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 31%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 44% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. 
Software as a Service revenue for the September quarter was $98 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. For the balance of fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into additional markets and geographies and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. 
As Mick discussed earlier, we're operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in Q1. In particular, we now do not see any improvement in our component supply position until our fourth quarter of FY '22.  
During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 57.2% in the September quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher manufacturing and freight costs, ASP declines and unfavorable currency movements, which has been partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $177 million, an increase of 11% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10% compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to the 21.1% we reported in the prior year quarter. 
Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year '22. R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year '22. 
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. 
During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. In anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions in our FY '21 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. 
We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. 
Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter September totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. 
We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operations. 
We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. 
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Primasun Heath and EctoSense, an acquisition we made on October 1. 
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

Well, it's easy in markets where we're fully vertically integrated, like Germany, South Korea, and other markets worldwide Australia, New Zealand and others and we're able to work directly with those patients and the doctors to make that happen. It is more difficult in other markets like France or the U.S. where we've worked through providers. But it's been pretty clear from our competitor there that they want people to go and register the devices, and they're going to focus, they said 12 months on just replacing those devices. And frankly, that's theoretical and legal duty to go do that. And so they are laser-focused on that. 
And so our work is to make sure -- we see the demand from patients directly in those vertically integrated markets and through distributors. And we're pretty confident that the vast, vast, vast majority of our devices go to new patients. There may be some going to replacement patients who are going online or going through certain aspects to get around and go faster than the Philips process, but certainly, the vast majority are going to new patients. 
The challenge for us is that the demand of being the #1 player and also covering as much of the demand of the #2 players as possible. We've reached the capacity of those critical components coming in the front end. And so we're not even able to meet all of that new patient demand with -- due to those supply chain constraints."

And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last quarter, we gave that $300 million to $350 million device rough guidance, right? It's not perfect because we're predicting 12 months out in a very uncertain environment. And as Brett just reiterated, we're sticking with that, knowing that we actually had $80 million to $90 million during this quarter that comes out of that, right, and then we've got the remainder to go fight for those components and be able to deliver that over the next 9 months. 
In the mask side, it's a very complicated story, and there's a number of moving factors, and we can get into this, and I can handle Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Sleep & Respiratory Care, can give further detail on this question or if there's a follow-up question on it. But what I can say on mask is we're not going to give public guidance around it, but there's a number of moving factors. You saw our mask growth during the quarter, it was globally at 8%, and the U.S. market was around 5%. The headwinds we have is that while our #2 competitor is not serving as many new patients as they should, and we're not able to take all that demand, there are less new patients being set up. And ResMed -- no matter what the device was, ResMed had a very good, well above 50% uptake rate of those new masks on new devices, no matter who was the manufacturer. And so that's a headwind for our business if there's a new patient that's not getting any therapy. 
And then the tailwinds would be, which are not as high in volume, but the tailwinds would be that when it is a ResMed device, there is a higher probability because they're designed to work together, and they are working better together and a doctor who loves our devices often likes our masks and same with the sleep technician and the sleep therapist and a respiratory therapist, they often like the brands across the technology spectrum and ResMed's the leader in that we do get a very good uptake on that. 
So there's some upgrade on the adherence rate to a ResMed device, but there's a headwind of -- even with a competitor device, if there's no device out there. less mask sales happening. And thus, you have the sort of 5% growth in the U.S. masks while we're limited on the ability as an industry. to take care of that upfront demand. I think that's about as much color as I can go into it without quantifying it for you. But I can tell you, it's a complex moving equation for us to model at a customer basis and a country level, so I can understand the difficulty for folks on the sell side as well."

I'm shifting my attention, which usually focuses purely on customers and governments and making sure the demand is there for this is an amazing industry that we serve and sleep apnea and asthma, and I'm spending a lot more time with suppliers. 
So with that, our best reading of the future flow of components is that, you look at it, and as Brett said in the prepared remarks, that we actually had reasonably good flow, some through inventory and working through that in the quarter of $80 million to $90 million here in the first quarter. It's going to be very difficult here in the December quarter with component shortages and very difficult in the March quarter with component shortages. I do think the components, as we are getting some increased signals and actually doing some great engineering to work around different suppliers and to design in new components. I feel much more confident about the June quarter 2022. So our Q4 fiscal year 2022. 
And so that's sort of qualitative guidance to it. 
We're not modeling it out. We've got the $300 million to $350 million. You can subtract off the $80 million to $90 million and model it. But if I was looking at it, it would be tougher in December and tougher in March right now and then freeing up in the June quarter and then September quarter, even more so as some of our new designs and new components get to roll in and we get that flow going. But look, it's changing day by day, week by week. I'm looking forward to my call this afternoon to potentially impact that. But even if I get agreement with someone today, it takes quite a while, as I explained sort of with that example of the 5 levels deep in the supply chain to get that to flow through from a foundry to a chip manufacturer to our factory to a product to the warehouse to then be able to sell it to a customer. 
So I know that's not a specific quantitative guidance, David. It's probably the best I can give you in terms of color for fiscal year 2022 and the hope we have in Q4 and Q1 '23 as we start to see those components really start to free up."

And I'm just going to back up to what we're trying to do in the business independent of the Philips call and then talk about the context of the Pilot call. With the launch of AirSense 11, our aim is to put in place a product that once again significantly improves the patient experience and significantly improves workflows and lower costs for providers and also puts us in the position midterm, long term to improve outcomes. 
So AirSense 11 is a device that we put on market anticipating long-term share gain. And we have internal goals for that number, and we don't talk about that number publicly, but our plan was to take share with that device. We're launching that device now into a situation where the #2 player in the market is out of the market for new patients. And so obviously, we're going to take quite a lot of share as we can put that product into the market, and we have the 2 best products on the market in AirSense 10 and AirSense11. 
So your question is how sticky will that share be? Our goal is to make it quite sticky. But obviously, we have good competitors in this market, and we don't anticipate landing at 100% share when they recall clears, but we want to have a number that's higher than what it was before we launched AirSense 11, and we're pretty confident we can do that. 
And just to cap on that, the answer is probably already too long, but to cap on that, I will say that we've managed to take a few points of mass share during the recall as well, and our aim would be to keep some of that share as well. So I think we will emerge from this stronger than when we entered it. And our offerings are clearly the best offerings on the market."

But I get the resupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree resupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible resupply. If you remember, that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago, even despite covered hitting this time a year ago, our mask resupply maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it, our mask resupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps, we're still achieving some very good rates in resupply. 
As I said, there are headwinds in it when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all marks, some new patients, no matter whose device it is in the global market. That's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of resupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market, look at Europe, Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in, you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8%, which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups.

And there was a tailwind created by Covid, which is patients, we've talked about this before over the last 3 or 4 quarters, but patients are more focused on having clean masks. I mean COVID has created a mentality, if I want a new mask, I want a fresh mask for patients. 
And then our HME customers in the U.S. have been focused on driving resupply into their installed base of patients. And I actually think that within the context of the Philips recall, driving revenue out of the installed base of patients has once again become quite an important emphasis for our HME customers. And then there are the headwinds. The headwinds of the whole market is not being served in a patient starts are down. And because we had slower new patient starts during the span of COVID overall because labs weren't open, there's a little bit of headwind on resupply because the installed base didn't grow during that period the way we might have anticipated it to. 
So it balances out. The dynamic inside of the installed base is quite good. So the installed base of patients continue to be resupplied at a very healthy rate."

I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader, everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it, and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said, there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. 
And to your question, they are getting, if you like, forced exposure because it's the only one available for new patients, to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device, the software, the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand, they're now trying a new brand. 
And I do think, to Jim's point earlier, that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says, ""Wow, this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong."" And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly, the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising, and the knowledge about the brands for better or for worse through this awful recall is they're getting to know what device they have. 
And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry. because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription buses and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial, clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as 
well. So I mean the short answer to your question is yes, we've got exposure to new consumers, new physicians, new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. The brand is the brand that represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient when it represents 3 less clicks to get a report, when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your National Health Trust system, really efficiently, it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow.

I think we've had a deal with which is heading this quarter as well. We were -- we did have a little bit of benefit on product mix with the higher acuity devices. So I think of the level Astral sellers, ASV devices they helped the total product mix this quarter, which helps on the gross margin side. So that was a little bit of a tailwind for us. 
But having said all that, there's still challenges, still pressures on freight still pressures that will come through on component costs and so on as well. So we need to keep an eye on that, but product mix has been quite good for us and that's helped. Yes. So overall, pretty pleased with how the gross margin ended up for the quarter."

But look, clearly, this is -- these are unprecedented times, costs. As you saw, and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin and going up. Freight costs, I mean, sea freight, there are over 100 ships just 2 hours north of me here on the I5 stack outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory sitting there. It's coming through higher cost than it's ever been. 
Air freight, we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market. this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes, but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed device is taking off the seats and overhead. 
And so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with AirSense 11, we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for 8 years, it's the best in the market, I think, ever, as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium, and so we will be extracting that. 
And look, we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look, this is a customer-by-customer, region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly, we cannot take all of the costs that have been given to us, and we are working with since launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer basis to address this over time. 
But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel. And I think that's what you saw during this last quarter."

It's been a long-term issue that getting the right staff and keeping them and dealing with the cost of training them and getting staff who are providing really good patient experience has been a big challenge for all of these care providers, not just hospitals. And so we believe that our technology solutions actually make life better for the staff, make it easier for them to do the job easier to get trained and more likely to stay on the job and also more efficient. 
So staffing challenges actually are another driver of our strategy, just like as Jim mentioned earlier, the concerns about cleanliness and respiratory health are a driver of our core sleep strategy, these staffing shortages and challenges do drive our SaaS strategy long term. And long term, that will be a tailwind for the business. 
Many, many short-term factors going on there. But we've -- as Mick said earlier, we're seeing good improved performance despite challenging times, particularly for skilled busing facilities across our SaaS businesses."

I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in 8 years. 
And as I said in my prep remarks, I mean, I'm blown away by things like the personal care system, watching the care check-in personal therapies or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage not just with the presentation from the marketing teams, but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device, I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. 
And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitive recall, irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID and vents and the tailwinds of vents and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. 
And as Jim said earlier, our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to my and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with Mya is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed throught this. 
So Steve, thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that."

As we said in Mick's prepared remarks, testing capacity is mostly back to normal. I would say, in the U.S. market, we're mostly back to normal, and there's actually probably some upside into that because a number of sleep labs increasingly during the covincrisis, home see testing was more readily adopted by sleep labs and maybe would not have taken it on before. And so probably -- you still probably got slightly fewer people going to labs but a much broader use of home sleep testing. And I think in general, you can say in the U.S., testing capacity is back to normal, maybe a little bit up, although the shape of it looks a little bit different. 
And then other reasons, it's really -- it varies quite a lot by what's happened with the Delta variant, what's happened with health care systems. But in general, I would say new patient starts in, say, Europe, are coming back to pre-COVID normal. Some countries are a little bit different. And in some cases, you've still got health systems that are a little bit backed up, right? So especially in hospital-based systems the diagnosis may be back up, but the actual capacity to set patients up on therapy may be now a bit of the bottleneck. So there's pent-up demand and things like that. But I would say, in general, we're almost back to normal. 
And I would add to that, one of the reasons we decided to move forward with the acquisition of EctoSense is that we really want to make it much easier for patients to understand whether or not they have a sleeping issue. So in some markets, EctoSense will be used as a screener. And in some markets, EctoSense is already used as a diagnostic tool. But the patient experience with that technology is really, really simple, really easy to do. And so we're working with that acquisition to open up the funnel even further."

Thanks, mIck. yes, on the inventory that -- a lot of that field reflects the components of raw materials part of our inventory. And we're really -- it's really in response, I think, to the elongation of supply chains and the bottlenecks and congestions that we're seeing. We are looking to support production for any upside in electronic components. So it says there's a lot of components that are ready to go once we get electronic components. So we've been pretty deliberate on that. 
We're looking to increase safety stocks as well, really just trying to deal with these supply disruptions. And the other big one we're seeing is that just with the increased seafreight, airfreight, lead times, it's sort of blowing out to 2, up to 4 weeks. So that's kind of more inventory that we're carrying, and I think probably a lot of companies will see that as well. So those logistics delays, I think, are causing a lot more, what I call, stock in transit coming through as well. 
So it's a combination of those factors. We're also running, for example, the dual AS 10, AS 11 platforms, and that's really there to support demand into the market. So we're doing that as well, which might be a little more unusual than what we would typically do. So the combination of those factors is really driving up our inventory levels a little bit low. Inventory days have been reasonable. So that's really trying to support overall production when we get those components in, I think, is the crux and the thesis there."

And so our best reading of the dynamics, even though we feel in aggregate, that $300 million and $350 million, which is which is a pretty broad range in itself and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it, that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through, whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now, and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. 
But look, things can change on a day by day, week by week, month by month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability, if you like, of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though, we get one 1 chip, it goes into 1 more device and goes to 1 patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in, that rate-limiting bottleneck part, it goes on to a product, gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on. And I'm giving as much color as I can qualitatively around that."

Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by ext",2426,"Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as continuing recovery of many markets from COVID-19. We achieved double-digit growth at both the top and bottom line metrics of our business. I want to be clear that achieving these results has not been easy this quarter. We are dealing with an unprecedented what I would call perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery, but also including a competitor recall that's -- a recall that's tenfold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. 
I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24/7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As the market leader, our competitor, that is in the #2 market share position, announced a recall mid-June that has created unprecedented dislocations in the market. In effect, we are facing the challenge of providing the volume for our own #1 market share position and also trying to meet as much of their #2 market share position as possible around the world. 
Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products, namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. 
As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers', suppliers', suppliers', suppliers', suppliers', suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We achieved our goal with that manufacturer. And we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge and are still facing it, of working with the 5 customers of theirs, all the way down that chain to get to us, to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately, to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. 
The supply chain analyses and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very fluid, changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt-laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7. In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips that ultimately limit our net production output. 
In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to distribution warehouses and ultimately, to customers, are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. 
We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders as the situation develops. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and the most important customer, the patient. 
Our #1 priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, for COPD, for asthma and for other chronic respiratory diseases as well as critical out-of-hospital care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need, where they need it and when they need it. 
Let's now discuss the overall market conditions in our industry. We are seeing a steady ongoing recovery of demand in the countries that we operate in. They remain at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of new patient flow. We are still seeing a divergence in total patient flow and sleep lab capacity from 75% to 95% of pre-COVID levels in some countries, up to 100% plus of pre-COVID levels in others. These metrics will continue to ebb and flow as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and as new variants of the coronavirus arise and cause temporary perturbations. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply the ventilators, the masks and the training for acute care and the transition home for affected patients. 
Let me now update you on our 3 strategic priorities as we pivot back to grow our core business. These 3 are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. 
In August, we launched our next-generation device platform that we call AirSense 11 into the United States market. In short, that launch has been very successful. We will be introducing the AirSense 11 into additional countries very soon. Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers, and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. 
Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevel available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. It's still early into the AirSense 11 launch, but initial customer feedback, combined with the detailed response as to our controlled product launch, tells me that the AirSense 11 is another success for ResMed. 
Physician, provider and patient feedback are all very positive. I was able to attend the California Sleep Society meeting in person, actually, during the quarter, and I was able to observe firsthand the responses to the latest innovations on the AirSense 11, such as personal therapy assistant, care check-in and the incredible rate of uptake of the patient-centric app called myAir, which has been upgraded for AirSense 11. And the uptake on that is almost double what it was for the myAir app than the AirSense 10. 
What's clear to me is that this platform, the AirSense 11, benefits not only patients and their bed partners, in addition, the device and software combination benefits physicians, it benefits providers and it benefits payers as well as entire health care systems with more data, more insights and better outcomes. 
As a 2-way digital health comms platform with many technical features that represent significant therapeutic advances, AirSense 11 is not only easy to set up and use, it also offers a very rich patient-centric experience. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology that is able to increase patient adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within health care providers' and physicians' own health systems. We are engaging with patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. This is a critical part of the ResMed 2025 strategy, as presented at our Investor Day, which we held virtually during this last quarter. 
Another key aspect of our long-term growth is linked to the awareness and the increasing flow of sleep apnea patients. With 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, this work is critical to our mission. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and remote care, including home-based sleep apnea tests. We want to support seamless and cost-effective approaches to sleep diagnostics. We want to scale technology that in our consumer markets enables an easy-to-use device experience and technology that, in our reimburse markets, can be a low-cost, clinically reliable, screening tool for sleep apnea. 
In this vein, on October 1, we closed a transaction to acquire Ectosense, a leader in cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology from Belgium. We believe Ectosense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of both physicians and sleep lab technicians as well as consumers can help significantly increase sleep apnea diagnosis rates as well as general sleep awareness. Ectosense will operate within our sleep and  respiratory care business unit, and we're excited to bring this innovative technology to more global markets as we move forward. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. 
Our long-term goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and high-flow therapy offerings. 
Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and beyond was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the United States where physicians and providers shifted focus to support the most severe, highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with our strategy to ensure priority for manufacturing and delivery of the devices that meets the needs of those patients, specifically those that need life support ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, including bilevel support, first. 
We are balancing the growth in the respiratory care demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the coronavirus pandemic as well as customers as they balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. 
We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been very helpful to physicians not only during COVID, but it is increasingly valuable on an ongoing basis for them and the health care systems that they operate in. 
In the not-too-distant future, I can see AirView becoming standard of care for patients on home-based ventilation protocols in many health care systems. 
Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment as well as facility-based and home-based care settings. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with customers as they utilize our software and data solutions, including Brightree and Snap resupply to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates of patients improve across SNFs and other facility-based care settings. We will continue to watch this closely as covered cases ebb and flow at slower and slower rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for technology investments in these SaaS verticals, which provides opportunities for us to increase our new customer pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease. 
As we look at our portfolio of software solutions, we expect SaaS revenue to accelerate, increasing from mid-single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are uniquely positioned, and we have created differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. 
Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. 
We are transforming out-of-hospital care at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology. With over 10 billion nights now, 10 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 15.5 million, 100% cloud-connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value from these data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. Our mission and goal, to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. 
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with COVID-19, with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now and you have now already pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all of our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry. 
Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open the call up for Q&A. Brett?"

In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase",1370,"Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. 
Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19-impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. 
In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the September '21 and September '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 25% on a constant currency basis. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. 
In relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $80 million to $90 million in the September quarter. 
Taking a look at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $491 million, an increase of 22%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $315 million, an increase of 23% and or an increase of 21% in constant currency terms. 
By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $276 million, an increase of 40%. Masks and other sales were $215 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $218 million, an increase of 24% or in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $97 million, an increase of 21% or in constant currency terms, an 18% increase. 
Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 31%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 44% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. 
Software as a Service revenue for the September quarter was $98 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. For the balance of fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into additional markets and geographies and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. 
As Mick discussed earlier, we're operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in Q1. In particular, we now do not see any improvement in our component supply position until our fourth quarter of FY '22.  
During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 57.2% in the September quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher manufacturing and freight costs, ASP declines and unfavorable currency movements, which has been partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. 
Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $177 million, an increase of 11% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10% compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to the 21.1% we reported in the prior year quarter. 
Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year '22. R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year '22. 
Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. 
During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. In anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions, in our FY '21 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. 
We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. 
Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. 
We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operations. 
We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million in gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. 
Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health and Ectosense, the acquisition we made on October 1. 
And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy."

Well, it's easy in markets where we're fully vertically integrated, like Germany, South Korea, and other markets worldwide, Australia, New Zealand and others, and we're able to work directly with those patients and the doctors to make that happen. It is more difficult in other markets like France or the U.S. where we've worked through providers. But it's been pretty clear from our competitor there that they want people to go and register the devices, and they're going to focus, they said 12 months on just replacing those devices. And frankly, that's their ethical and legal duty to go do that. And so they are laser-focused on that. 
And so our work is to make sure we see the demand from patients directly in those vertically integrated markets and through distributors. And we're pretty confident that the vast, vast, vast majority of our devices go to new patients. There may be some going to replacement patients who are going online or going through certain aspects to get around and go faster than the Philips process, but certainly, the vast majority are going to new patients. 
The challenge for us is that the demand of being the #1 player and also covering as much of the demand of the #2 players as possible. We've reached the capacity of those critical components coming in, in the front end. And so we're not even able to meet all of that new patient demand with -- due to those supply chain constraints."

And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last",513,"Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's a great question. And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last quarter, we gave that $300 million to $350 million device rough guidance, right? It's not perfect because we're predicting 12 months out in a very uncertain environment. And as Brett just reiterated, we're sticking with that, knowing that we actually had $80 million to $90 million during this quarter that comes out of that, right? And so then we've got the remainder to go fight for those components and be able to deliver that over the next 9 months. 
In the mask side, it's a very complicated story, and there's a number of moving factors. And we can get into this, and I can hand to Jim Hollingshead, who runs our sleep and respiratory care, can give further detail on this question or if there's a follow-up question on it. But what I can say on masks is we're not going to give public guidance around it, but there's a number of moving factors. 
You saw our mask growth during the quarter, it was globally at 8%, and the U.S. market was around 5%. The headwinds we have is that while our #2 competitor is not serving as many new patients as they should, and we're not able to take all that demand, there are less new patients being set up. And ResMed, no matter what the device was, ResMed had a very good, well above 50% uptake rate of those new masks on new devices, no matter who was the manufacturer. And so that's a headwind for our business if there's a new patient that's not getting any therapy. 
And then the tailwinds would be, which are not as high in volume, but the tailwinds would be that when it is a ResMed device, there is a higher probability because they're designed to work together, and they are working better together and a doctor who loves our devices often likes our masks and same with a sleep technician and the sleep therapist and a respiratory therapist, they often like the brands across the technology spectrum, and ResMed's the leader in that. We do get a very good uptake on it. 
So there's some upgrade on the adherence rate to a ResMed device, but there's a headwind of, even with a competitor device, if there's no device out there, there's less mask sales happening. And thus, you have the sort of 5% growth in the U.S. masks while we're limited on the ability, as an industry, to take care of that upfront demand. I think that's about as much color as I can go into it without quantifying it for you. But I can tell you, it's a complex moving equation for us to model at a customer basis and a country level, so I can understand the difficulty for folks in the sell side as well."

I'm shifting my attention, which usually focuses purely on customers and governments and making sure the demand is there for this is amazing industry that we serve in sleep apnea and asthma, and I'm spending a lot more time with suppliers. 
So with that, our best reading of the future flow of components is that, you look at it, and as Brett said in the prepared remarks, that we actually had reasonably good flow, some through inventory and working through that in the quarter of $80 million to $90 million here in the first quarter. It's going to be very difficult here in the December quarter with component shortages and very difficult in the March quarter with component shortages. 
I do think the components, as we are getting some increased signals and actually doing some great engineering to work around different suppliers and to design in new components. I feel much more confident about the June quarter 2022. So our Q4 fiscal year 2022. And so that's sort of qualitative guidance to it. 
We're not modeling it out. We've got the $300 million to $350 million. You can subtract off the $80 million to $90 million and model it. But if I was looking at it, it would be tougher in December and tougher in March right now, and then freeing up in the June quarter, and in September quarter, even more so as some of our new designs and new components get to roll in and we get that flow going. But look, it's changing day by day, week by week. I'm looking forward to my call this afternoon to potentially impact that. But even if I get agreement with someone today, it takes quite a while, as I explained, sort of with that example of the 5 levels deep in the supply chain to get that to flow through from a foundry, to a chip manufacturer, to our factory, to a product, to then our warehouse, to then be able to sell it to a customer. 
So I know that's not a specific quantitative guidance, David. It's probably the best I can give you in terms of color for fiscal year 2022 and the hope we have in Q4 and Q1 '23 as we start to see those components really start to free up."

And I'm just going to back up to what we're trying to do in the business, independent of the Philips recall, and then talk about the context of the Philips recall. With the launch of AirSense 11, our aim is to put in place a product that once again significantly improves the patient experience and significantly improves workflows and lowers cost for providers, and also puts us in the position, midterm to long term to improve outcomes. 
So AirSense 11 is a device that we put on market anticipating long-term share gain. And we have internal goals for that number, and we don't talk about that number publicly, but our plan was to take share with that device. We're launching that device now into a situation where the #2 player in the market is out of the market for new patients. And so obviously, we're going to take as -- quite a lot of share as we can put that product into the market, and we have the 2 best products on the market in AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. 
So your question is how sticky will that share be. Our goal is to make it quite sticky. But obviously, we have good competitors in this market, and we don't anticipate landing at 100% share when the recall clears, but we want to have a number that's higher than what it was before we launched AirSense 11, and we're pretty confident we can do that. 
And just to cap on that, this answer is probably already too long, but to cap on that, I will say that we've managed to take a few points of mass share during the recall as well, and our aim would be to keep some of that share as well. So I think we will emerge from this stronger than when we entered it. And our offerings are clearly the best offerings on the market."

But I can tell you, the resupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree resupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible resupply. If you remember, that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago. Even despite COVID hitting this time a year ago, our mask resupply, and maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it, our mask resupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps, we're still achieving some very good rates in resupply. 
As I said, there are headwinds in that -- when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all masks on new patients, no matter whose device it is in the global market, that's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of resupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market, look at Europe, Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in, you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8%, which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups.

And there was a tailwind created by COVID, which is patients -- we've talked about this before over the last 3 or 4 quarters, but patients are more focused on having clean masks, right? COVID has created a mentality of I want a new mask, I want a fresh mask, for patients. 
And then our HME customers in the U.S. have been focused on driving resupply into their installed base of patients. And I actually think that within the context of the Philips recall, driving revenue out of the installed base of patients has once again become quite an important emphasis for our HME customers. And then there are the headwinds. The headwinds of the whole market is not being served, the new patient starts are down. And because we had slower new patient starts during the span of COVID overall because labs weren't open, there's a little bit of headwind on resupply because the installed base didn't grow during that period the way we might have anticipated it to. 
So it balances out. The dynamic insight of the installed base is quite good. So the installed base of patients continue to be resupplied at a very healthy rate."

I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader, everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it, and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said, there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. 
And to your question, they are getting, if you like, forced exposure because it's the only one available for new patients, to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device, the software, the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand, they're now trying a new brand. 
And I do think, to Jim's point earlier, that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says, ""Wow, this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong."" And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly, the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising, and their knowledge about the brands, for better or for worse, through this awful recall is they're getting to know what device they have. 
And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry, because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription biases and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial, clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as well. So I mean the short answer to your question is yes, we've got exposure to new consumers, new physicians, new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. 
The brand is the brand, but when it represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient, when it represents 3 less clicks to get a report, when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your national health trust system, really efficiently, it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow. And that's the type of share that we think is part of the ResMed brand and will maintain our strong growth for a long period to come through for this period."

How would you -- or could you help us characterize what you've observed on the price/volume mix somehow in the quarter?"

And you're right, we don't provide details around pricing. But look, clearly, this is -- these are unprecedented times. Costs, as you saw, and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin, are going up. Freight costs, I mean, sea freight, there are over 100 ships just 2 hours north of me here on the I-5 stuck outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory is sitting there. It's coming through, higher cost than it's ever been. 
Airfreight, we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market with this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes, but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed devices taking up the seats and overhead. 
And so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with the AirSense 11, we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for 8 years, it's the best in the market, I think, ever, as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium, and so we will be extracting that. 
And look, we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look, this is a customer-by-customer, region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly, we cannot take all the costs that are being given to us, and we are working with Airsense 11 launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer-on-customer basis to address this over time. 
But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel, and I think that's what you saw during this last quarter."

But on the U.S. hospital front, I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing facilities-based SaaS -- the census rates at skilled nursing facilities are starting to pick up. The numbers of patients in beds is picking up. And we actually think, as you said, that there's a pent-up demand for technology to help with that.

It's actually an underpinning of our SaaS strategy that it's been a long-term issue, getting the right staff and keeping them and dealing with the cost of training them and getting staff who are providing really good patient experience has been a big challenge for all of these care providers, not just hospitals. And so we believe that our technology solutions actually make life better for the staff, make it easier for them to do the job, easier to get trained and more likely to stay on the job and also more efficient. 
So staffing challenges actually are another driver of our strategy, just like as Jim mentioned earlier, the concerns about cleanliness and respiratory health are a driver of our core sleep strategy, these staffing shortages and challenges do drive our SaaS strategy long term. And long term, that will be a tailwind for the business. 
Many, many short-term factors going on there. But we've -- as Mick said earlier, we're seeing good, improved performance despite challenging times, particularly for skilled busing facilities across our SaaS businesses."

I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in 8 years. 
And as I said in my prep remarks, I mean, I'm blown away by things like the personal care system, watching the care check-in, the personal therapies -- or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage, not just with the presentation from the marketing teams, but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device, I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. 
And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitor recall, irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID events and the tailwinds events and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. 
And as Jim said earlier, our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to myAir and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with myAir is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed throughout this phone call.
So Steve, thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that."

As we said in Mick's prepared remarks, testing capacity is mostly back to normal. I would say, in the U.S. market, we're mostly back to normal, and there's actually probably some upside built into that because a number of sleep labs increasingly during the COVID crisis, home sleep testing was more readily adopted by sleep labs who maybe would not have taken it on before. 
And so probably, you still probably got slightly fewer people going to labs but a much broader use of home sleep testing. And I think in general, you can say, in the U.S., testing capacity is back to normal, maybe a little bit up, although the shape of it looks a little bit different. 
And then other reason it's really -- it varies quite a lot by what's happened with the Delta variant, what's happened with health care systems. But in general, I would say new patient starts in, say, Europe, are coming back to pre-COVID normal. Some countries are a little bit different. And in some cases, you've still got health systems that are a little bit backed up, right? So especially in hospital-based systems the diagnosis may be back up, but the actual capacity to set patients up on therapy may be now a bit of the bottleneck. So there's pent-up demand and things like that. But I would say, in general, we're almost back to normal. 
And I would add to that, one of the reasons we decided to move forward with the acquisition of Ectosense is that we really want to make it much easier for patients to understand whether or not they have a sleeping issue. So in some markets, Ectosense will be used as a screener. And in some markets, Ectosense is already used as a diagnostic tool. But the patient experience with that technology is really, really simple, really easy to do. And so we're working with that acquisition to open up the funnel even further."

Lyanne, yes, on the inventory that -- a lot of that field reflects the components of raw materials part of our inventory. And we're really -- it's really in response, I think, to the elongation of supply chains and the bottlenecks and congestions that we're seeing. We are looking to support production for any upside in electronic components. So there's a lot of components that are ready to go once we get electronic components. So we've been pretty deliberate on that. 
We're looking to increase safety stocks as well, really just trying to deal with these supply disruptions. And the other big one we're seeing is that just with the increased sea freight, airfreight, lead times, it's sort of blowing out to 2, up to 4 weeks. So that's kind of more inventory that we're carrying, and I think probably a lot of companies will see that as well. So those logistics delays, I think, are causing a lot more, what I call, stock in transit coming through as well. 
So it's a combination of those factors. We're also running, for example, the dual AS 10, AS 11 platforms, and that's really there to support demand into the market. So we're doing that as well, which might be a little more unusual than what we would typically do. So the combination of those factors is really driving up our inventory levels a little bit low. Inventory days have been reasonable. So that's really trying to support overall production when we get those components in, I think, is the crux and the thesis there."

Thanks, Dan. So look, it's a complex and moving dynamic. But the rate-limiting step here is electronic components and specifically the semiconductor chips from a particular manufacturing and a supply chain that I know the names and the people and I'm talking to them to try and get this supply. The trouble is that there are multiple other industries. And demand for semiconductor chips that are through the roof. 
And obviously, everyone on this call follows many other industries. You've heard this, we're not alone in medical device industry, automotive industry, consumer communications industry, even consumer products are often cloud-connected now and have these limitations. So look, things haven't gone better these last 90 days in terms of supply. They've got very difficult. 
And our visibility, as I look at the June quarter, I feel very confident in the semiconductor chips coming through. But in December and March, it's hand to mouth of these devices and chartering planes and working with redesigns to make sure the semiconductor chips go so much in. And so our best reading of the dynamics, even though we feel in aggregate, that $300 million and $350 million, which is which is a pretty broad range in itself, and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it, that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through, whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now, and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. 
But look, things can change on a day by day, week by week, month by month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain, as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability, if you like, of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though, we get 1 more chip, it goes into 1 more device and goes to 1 patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient plant in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in, that rate-limiting bottleneck part, it goes on to a product, gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on.

Every chip you get is a patient's life changed. So I look forward to talking with you all again, all of our stakeholders here in 90 days.
