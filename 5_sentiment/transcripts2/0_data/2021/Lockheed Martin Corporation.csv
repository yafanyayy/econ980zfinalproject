I hope you've all had a great start to the new year and that this call finds you and your family safe and healthy. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. As we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments and our outlook for 2021. 
Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the loss of Michelle Evans, our Aeronautics business area leader who passed away earlier this month. Michelle dedicated 34 years of service to our company and touch the lives of countless people, both inside and outside the corporation. I knew Michelle for years, and I can say that she lived the life of strength and grace. And while we mourn her loss, we also are thankful to have her as part of our Lockheed Martin family. We'll all miss Michelle. 
As we look back to the year from a broader perspective, 2020 introduced personal and professional challenges to each and every one of us. I'll begin my summary of Lockheed Martin's results today by thanking the men and women of our company and their families for stepping up to deliver outstanding performance during the extremely difficult time. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to drive operational and financial results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations but also set records in several areas. 
The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing pandemic, and we're continuing to take actions to mitigate its impacts. Vaccines are also becoming available to help combat this disease, and we're hopeful for a return to a more normal business environment as we progress throughout the year. Our dedicated workforce and our resilient supply chain continue to perform with excellence. during these demanding times, supporting our global customers and their important missions, and I'm very proud of their accomplishments. 
Moving to our results. We delivered another year of outstanding performance in 2020, strategically, operationally and financially. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our full year 2021 financial outlook. But I'd like to provide a few highlights from the past year, a period in which we set high watermarks in sales, earnings and cash from operations. 
First, sales and segment profit each grew 9% over 2019, and our 2020 earnings per share increased by 11%. We had a strong year of cash generation, achieving $8.2 billion of cash from operations even after a $1 billion voluntary pension contribution and after accelerating payments to our supply chain to help mitigate COVID impacts. 
We are continuing this practice, prioritizing our vulnerable and small business partners. We recorded over $68 billion in orders in 2020, growing our backlog by $3 billion resulting in a robust 140. We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions, investing in innovative technologies, strategic opportunities to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and still returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to defense budgets. For fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has been passed into legislation. And the Department of Defense appropriations were approved as part of the FY '21 Omnibus Funding Bill. Both of these congressional actions adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which established spending levels for discretionary defense budgets, with a total fiscal year 2021 National Defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Also, Congress passed a $900 billion COVID relief package, which extended Section 3610 of the CARES Act to March 31, providing federal agencies the authority to reimburse contractors who are temporarily unable to work due to facility closures or other restrictions. 
Lockheed Martin programs were well-supported in the FY '21 appropriations bill with Congress adding funding of over $1.7 billion for 17 additional F-35 aircraft and other development and integration activities for the program, adding nearly $900 million for 9 additional C-130 Js plus support work for that airplane. And over $400 million for Sikorsky programs, including additional CH-53K and BLACK HAWK helicopters. And also the initiation of an 8 THAAD battery for the U.S. Army.
Turning to our portfolio. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements, demonstrating our focus on strategic growth and operational performance. As we announced last month, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne, an action that once finalized, will bring long-term strategic value to our entire portfolio. As we commented then, our 21st century warfare strategy includes enabling growth areas such as hypersonics, tactical and integrated air and missile defense and space systems domains. Aerojet's expertise and propulsion systems will benefit our existing hypersonic programs as they progress from development to production and will improve our tactical missiles and air and missile defense products, while continuing Aerojet Rocketdyne's legacy as a merchant supplier to the entire industry. 
We believe this combination will deliver innovations and improve efficiencies that will offer more timely and affordable solutions for all of our customers, including the defense department, domestic manufacturers and our international partners, and we're very excited about this transaction. 
Moving to the business areas. In Aeronautics, our F-35 team finished the year strong, delivering a total of 120 F-35 aircraft. Our aero production organization, our partners, teammates in the supply chain, all work to overcome manufacturing issues introduced by this pandemic. We've now delivered over 600 airplanes since the program's inception, with nearly 360 jets still in backlog and domestic as well as international opportunities ahead of us. Over 2/3 of the jets on the plan of record are still to be ordered. So the aircraft continues to perform well. So operating from 26 bases and ships around the globe. And the Royal Australian Air Force recently declared initial operating capability in December, the seventh country to do so since the program began. Also in our Aeronautics business, the U.S. Air Force awarded a $900 million contract for us to provide sustainment and support services for F-16 aircraft, including maintenance and modification activities. Of course, the F-16 is one of our longest-running production programs, and we will look to optimize the Air Force's F-16 fleet for greater capability, readiness and performance via this new sustainment contract. 
Moving to our Space business area. We recently won a $4.9 billion award for our next-generation overhead persistent infrared or OPIR contract. This award funds the production of 3 geosynchronous satellites and ground systems to provide initial warning of ballistic or tactical missile launches anywhere in the world. These new space vehicles will have more powerful sensors and greater resiliency to enhance our nation's air and missile defense capabilities well under the 21st century. 
Keeping with our Space organization, we're pleased to be selected for one of the awards to develop a prototype payload for the new evolved strategic satellite communication system. ESS is designed to be the successor to the advanced extremely high-frequency constellation of satellites, one of our signature programs that provide secure and survivable strategic communications for national leaders and tactical commanders alike. This is our OPIR satellites, the ESS constellation is intended to provide improved resiliency, survivability and increased capabilities. We look forward to participating in this opportunity as we work to enrich our platforms with more mission systems content, which is another key facet of our 21st century warfare strategy. 
I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control business areas, which recently led Lockheed Martin's participation in an exercise Valeant Shield 2020, which is a biannual joint effort for the U.S. Navy, Army, Air Force and Marine Corps. Our combined team used a virtualized Aegis weapon system to conduct a pioneering joint multi-domain long fires demonstration. By delivering machine-to-machine interfaces across joint force systems, this effort accelerated speed of decision-making and then to action. It demonstrated a primary premise of our 21st century war fighting strategy by networking separate sensors, communication links and weapons across multiple platforms. The result is a more effective joint all-domain operations that provides enhanced capabilities and greater effectiveness to the commander in a field of operations. These achievements highlight our strategy to help address emerging threats with 21st century capabilities to invest in new and innovative technologies and leverage our signature programs to provide powerful deterrence to future military conflicts. That's our mission. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year",1139,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. 
Sales, segment operating profit cash from operations and earnings per share from continuing operations closed with record annual highs. We generated $8.2 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter. And we continued our cash deployment actions returning $3.9 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in the strategic growth of the business, including acquiring i3 and record investments in IRAD and capital expenditures. We also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne in the fourth quarter, with the close expected in the second half of 2021. I will note that our 2021 outlook includes -- excludes all results associated with this transaction. 
While backlog declined approximately $3 billion in the quarter due primarily to the timing of the F-35 Lot 15 production order, 2020 represented the sixth consecutive annual increase in year-end backlog for the corporation. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business, and Lockheed Martin is well positioned for continued success in 2021. 
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% in 2020 compared with last year to $65.4 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first 3 quarters while segment operating profit also increased 9% over last year to nearly $7.2 billion. 
On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. As Jim mentioned, all 4 of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2020, led by Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control at 11%. Aeronautics growth was driven by development and sustainment increases on F-35 and F-16 and as well as growth in advanced development programs. Missiles and Fire Controls growth was primarily from production volume in tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense lines of business. I will note that all 4 of our business areas achieved record highs for sales in 2020. 
Chart 6 shows our earnings per share for 2020. Our EPS from continuing operations of $24.50 was up $2.55 or 12% higher than our results from last year, driven primarily by increased volume and sustained performance. 
On Chart 7, we'll discuss our backlog. Driven by annual increases at 3 of our 4 business areas, we maintained a book-to-bill ratio above 1 for the full year of 2020. This continued backlog growth, combined with further visibility of our 2021 orders, provides additional confidence in our increased sales outlook for 2021. 
On Chart 8, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2020. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $8.2 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow is greater than $6.4 billion, nearly a 6% increase over 2019. This growth was achieved despite accelerating more payments to our supply chain than we received from the favorable DoD initiative progress payment increases, and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. We increased our dividend by more than 8% and executed our planned share repurchases for the year with $1.1 billion in total shares retired. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $3.9 billion for the year or 60% of free cash flow providing a solid returns to the shareholders in 2020. 
Moving on to Chart 9. We provide our outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $67.1 billion to $68.5 billion. The midpoint of this range represents nearly a 4% increase over 2020, an improvement from our October estimate even after incorporating the impact of the U.K. MOD's decision to in-source contract support for the atomic weapons establishment. The $700 million sales reduction for this change is reflected in our outlook for the Space business. Were not for this decision, our estimated sales increase would have been approximately 5%, which is greater than the estimated 3% sales growth we discussed in the last earnings call. We have incorporated the known COVID impacts into our 2021 financial outlook. We will continue to work with our U.S. government customers to monitor COVID risk to our operations in the supply chain, and we will continue exploring potential paths to recovery of cost impacts where appropriate, to minimize future impacts. 
The range for segment operating profit is estimated to be approximately $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. Our estimated FAS/CAS pension adjustment is approximately $2.3 billion, our estimated range for 2021 earnings per share grows to between $26 to $26.30. The midpoint of this range represents approximately an 8% increase over 2020 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $8.3 billion, and I will discuss this in greater detail on the following chart. 
On Chart 10, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational performance drove a reduction in working capital, which allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2021 to greater than or equal to $8.3 billion. We now see approximately $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2022, increasing our 3-year cash generation estimate by $900 million over our prior assessment. And as we sit here now, we see 2023 cash from operations of approximately $9 billion. I should note this outlook and trends are prior to an estimated R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act change that would impact 2022 cash by approximately $2.1 billion and lower 2023 cash by approximately $1.8 billion. 
On Chart 11, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All 4 business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2021, approximately 4% for the corporation led by Aeronautics at 5%. Segment operating profit growth is also projected to grow at approximately 4% in the aggregate, with our largest growth in Aeronautics at 6%. 
And finally, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe 2020 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin during these challenging times. Our team diligently worked to minimize the impacts of the pandemic to our business and our supply chain, and we have increased our estimates for 2021 for all key financial metrics. Our results in 2020 exceeded previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation this upcoming year. We remain focused on cash generation and growth in 2021. We will continue to invest in discriminating technologies and strategic initiatives to deliver value to our customers while providing strong cash returns to stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Brad?"

And the benefit of the position of the company is that we have a strong position in the, I'd say, classic large bus, military, defense satellites and intelligent community satellites, but we also have the ability to go down range into medium and low orbit as well as geosynchronous orbit. So the whole playing field in national defense space is open to Lockheed Martin. And what we're doing in the business is we're introducing these 21st century technologies and taking advantage of that space platform. And so you see us winning recently low orbit transport layer contract, which is a pioneering initiative of the Department of Defense to start introducing 5G and other modern networking technologies into the space domain, we're part of that. And what we've been able to do is to connect our Space assets already using some of those newer technologies and AI and also distributing compute into our aerospace, land and sea forces as well, the platforms that we deploy there. So we have a broad space strategy, which is to take 21st century networking, storage and compute technologies into our space domain as really a competitive advantage versus other defense contractors that don't have that asset available to them. The second part of your question is, well, how does Aerojet Rocketdyne create value in doing this? And it really goes hand-in-hand with our hypersonic strategy, which is part of our 21st century war fighting initiative. I view Lockheed Martin's benefit or role in defense enterprise is adding velocity to it. The world is moving faster, both kinetically, if you will, and in a networking and AI perspective as well. And we need to speed up. And just taking one dimension of that hypersonic missiles and countering hypersonic missiles requires a much better, tighter integration of the propulsion system into the body of the missile. The heat generated by these hypersonic missiles is incredible and just managing that heat and thermal issue is one of the reasons we invested in i3 as well. So we are selecting what we think are the most important defense platforms and connectivity capacities for the future of warfare and we're investing in those. And Aerojet Rocketdyne is part and parcel of that investment strategy. Propulsion integration in the hypersonic missile glide bodies is essential. The other benefit of us working in a more integrated fashion with Aerojet Rocketdyne is we'll be able to bring our broad engineering expertise, our capital and our operational experience into Aerojet Rocketdyne and bring the best of Lockheed Martin to the propulsion side of missiles and space. So there are incredible synergies here. I know Ken can speak to a little bit more on those later, both revenue and cost. But given my long answer, I'll stop there."

And so you're going to have, we believe, a lot of continuity and policy and also in focus on how important strong defense is for this country. So I think the proposed team is a plus and unfortunately, frankly, the threat outside against potentially United States is growing. It's accelerating, too, by the way. And when we look at the National Defense strategy, it reorients itself and reorients our defense enterprise towards great power competition. And it's something you cannot just sit still and watch go by because we will be overtaken because of the aggressiveness of our potential peers. So I'm taking solace in these trends as far as the defense budget goes, that you have professional experienced people leading it for the administration and that the threat environment is greater versus lesser. We feel that supports a stable defense budget going forward."

And as I stated a few times now, it looks like it's about $2.1 billion in 2022, $1.8 billion in 2023, and it will continue trending down. One of the reasons we are extremely focused on cash. You heard in my prepared comments, the amount of cash that we're generating in '22 and '23. I've stated, we've taken -- we took a pause for the -- roughly the second half of last year before we started talking to the key constituents about that impact. It is still our belief that we think there's some likelihood it will either be repealed or altered. So it just doesn't include entire research expenses, which would include our cost plus contracts, but would be just our research and our IRAD, our research and development costs, which would not be a material impact to our -- to the outlooks I gave you. We still think there's a good likelihood that's going to happen because if you think about it, if in 2022, we have $2.1 billion less of cash, this is just Lockheed Martin. And as you know, Joe, this is not just Lockheed Martin and not just A&D. This is all of industry. So this is going to hit pharma hard, it's going to hit high-tech hard. These are dollars that we're not going to have the ability to plow back and invest into our portfolio and into our technologies. And I think that is a compelling story. And I think at the end of the day, that's going to rule the day. Now having said that, we are still generating large amounts of cash. In fact, as you know, we ended the year in excess of $3 billion cash on hand. Right now, assuming our dividend assumptions and our share repurchase assumptions for 2021, we're going to end 2021 with over $5 billion of cash. That number is going to continue to grow. And that, frankly, that's a good opportunity for us to do the things Jim described from an investment standpoint and then to continue our robust cash deployment strategy that we have historically had with our shareholders."

And then the other half is a combination of lease space, GOCO, which is government-owned, contractor-operated much like our Fort Worth facility. And then GOGO, which is government-owned, government-operated, which is AWE. And so there's a couple of -- just short term, there's a couple of puts and takes. Assuming the U.K. government does take over the management of AWE. We lose about 4.5 million square feet out of that 72 million squares. When we're successful with the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, I believe they have about 3 million square feet that we would add back. You mentioned, Mike, the Palmdale building that we're building. We also have a little bit of real estate that we're expanding in space and in RMS and in Missiles and Fire Control, and that nets about 1 million square feet. So at the end of the day, we're going to be down about 0.5 million squares. But now the opportunity comes. Right now, we have roughly half of our employees working remotely. Some of them are periodically coming in. But we have, over the last couple of months, have rolled out a plan frankly, looking at Lockheed Martin forward is what we call it, and it's, frankly, the future of work. And we are going to start looking at getting out of some of that lease space as our leases expire. You can expect us to reduce our footprint by at least a couple of million square feet in the next couple of years, if not more. We'll go to more hoteling. We'll allow people that -- where it makes sense for them to work from home, and we'll make sure this is a competitive and strategic advantage for us."

And that they have real value and deterrence in national defense. And so I do think that we'll have a more open environment for FMS and direct commercial sales to our international partners. The other benefit, you've seen it recently in the press is that we have some fantastic and unmatched products that are in great demand and highly desired by many countries. So you've seen F-16 sales coming back. F-35 was a pivotal element of the Abraham accords, we believe. And that system is so highly desired by our allies and the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that it actually helped bring a modicum of piece to the Middle East. And so our -- between our products and the Biden administrations stated to enhance our alliances, I think we're in a better position going forward."

And unfortunately, I do have to be a little cryptic, and I apologize for that, but I'll try to give you color to the best of my abilities. We have seen our classified business from an order book standpoint and from a sales standpoint, growing faster than the corporation. If you go around the horn, I've mentioned in the past, we won a strategic program in Palmdale, where we're starting to see the benefits of multiple customers starting to want that system. In fact, we're also in conversation with an international partner of the United States of their interest in that system. And back to Mike's question, that's the reason for the capital growth out in Palmdale. There is some other things going on out there that, unfortunately, we can't talk about that I think we'll reap the benefits of. Some of them are hypersonics. Some of them are other platforms. At Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the large development program that we won. It is progressing well. It's going to continue to grow in the future probably as fast, if not faster than the rest of Missiles and Fire Control. And then probably the other big place to talk is space. We won a couple rather large strategic programs in 2020. We're also pursuing a few in 2021. And also the -- from a sales standpoint, as I mentioned, across the corporation, growing faster than top line than our business in the aggregate is. From a margin standpoint, margins in Aeronautics for Palmdale, the classified work right now is dilutive just by the nature of the contract types. Same with Missiles and Fire Control. These programs are going to be dilutive, growing faster than the rest of the portfolio. But from a margin standpoint, going to be dilutive. The good news also is -- but from a contract-type standpoint, they're not an impact to working capital. So there'll be a reasonably good cash flow. In the Space business, some of these programs are fixed price, but most of them are going to be cost-plus as well. So just slightly dilutive to the overall portfolio. But again, I apologize, that's about as much as I could say about the portfolio."

We see -- right now, we see margins pretty steady at 11%. So most of that is -- I've talked to Wall Street about our focus on cash, what we've called it as a culture of cash where generally over the last couple of years, it's not just, frankly, a balance sheet issue is not the finance community just to solve. It's the entire corporation where, say, production operations understands the consequences of making or missing deliveries and how that impacts cash. So we see more opportunities going forward managing the balance sheet, specifically contract assets, in inventory and ensuring that if they're going to grow, they're growing at the most efficient way possible. And then also, as Jim mentioned, we see opportunities. I'm not going to talk about specifically FMS, but probably more direct government sales where there's an opportunity for us to get cash advances. To answer your second part of your question, we do see some opportunity, though, to be better than 11%. And that's specifically, our programs that will start to mature pick F-16. We're generally in the beginning of the production cycle again. We're going to deliver 8 airplanes in 2022. And then we'll get up to a significant double-digit deliveries in '23 and beyond. There is an opportunity for us to have margin improvement there. F-35, everybody wants to talk about F-35. We do still think there's opportunities there from a margin standpoint with production. We've talked to you about the PBL concept to the -- performance-based logistics concept, that we've had that we do think there's some margin opportunity there for industry assuming we perform, assuming we hit the critical service level agreements that we want. Hypersonics will soon get out of development and hopefully go into a limited rate production and production that will help us. All the helicopter programs that we've talked about, you'll start to see CH-53K, moving out of development into production. Presidential helicopter, of course, is moving into production. You have combat search and rescue that will move into production. Those are just a couple of examples, Sheila. I think that will give us an opportunity to enhance our margin over time."

I mean, if you go all the way back to the primary notion that we're back into a world of great power competition.

And compare our capabilities in the -- if I'm in government, comparing our defense industrial-based capabilities to those of the peer group. How does China operate, its defense industrial base, how does it organize it? And what are the capabilities and velocity again that comes from that. And from that perspective, my view would be that vertical integration concerns from a classic antitrust perspective are dwarfed by the lack of velocity and inability to integrate and added cost, frankly, that comes from the existing defense industrial base structure that's stratified with a supply chain that's quite fragmented. I think it's better for the country and for the defense enterprise to enable industry to make logical proposals for bringing in the mission systems, if you will, the supply chain that goes into major platforms into a more integrated organization. So I think that's the philosophical basis. On the other hand, we cannot predict the decisions of individual regulators and those coming into office. But I do think that it's critical that those decisions look through the lens of great power competition and how we compare to the defense industrial base, certainly, of China."

But if you look at our hypersonics portfolio through 2020, our total order book was north of $3 billion. We generated about $1.2 billion in hypersonics sales in 2020. And think of that as mostly development and cost-plus programs. And actually, we had a couple of risk retirements at the end of the year. So our programs are performing. For 2021, Noah, the best of our abilities, right now, we see hypersonic sales being about $1.5 billion. And still dilutive margins just based on contract type and the type of work that's being done. We're going to have a handful of these programs. We'll have first launch continued demonstration of capabilities this year and next year. And then as I've stated in the past, you'll start seeing some of these programs neck down, as you saw last year where we had one program terminated, but we actually saw the funding start to go to some of our other platforms. So for us, really not a harman and it intuitively made sense. So by the middle of the decade, it's conceivable that, that number could be closer to $3 billion. You'll start to see some of these limited rate production programs happening. Some of these programs will actually start going into full scale production. So it's conceivable that our sales will more than double by the middle of this decade.

But if you go back to the first principles of the administration, based on candidate Biden, and now President Biden's campaign, jobs and economic recovery, incredibly important to him into his administration. And there are no better source of jobs in international military sales for this country and -- in large part because these are -- tend to be engineering-stemmed, high salary and the manufacturing jobs also high wage reliable, dependable jobs with companies that have strong benefits, et cetera. So if jobs in the economy are important, the promotion of international defense sales, one would surmise, would also be important. So from that perspective, I expect that we're going to get strong support, let alone from, as I mentioned earlier, the interest and desire to have increased collaboration, cooperation with our allies. And as an ex-pilot myself, I can tell you that there's no better way to get a tighter bond with an ally than sell them jet aircraft, fighter aircraft, because all the way back in the mid-80s when I was in pilot training, we had Saudis in our class, for example. Then when I was at Pratt & Whitney, we built an F-100 engine overhaul in repair shop in Saudi Arabia that further cemented our collaboration with that country, is just 2 tiny examples. And then you've got, again, the training, collaboration, you've got industrial collaboration. You're doing exercises together. You're using the same cockpit avionics, just goes on and on how you can increase your alliance stickiness, if you will, with major defense sales.

To state it, we saw strong growth. And we're going to see strong growth into 2021. That will be the fastest-growing piece of F-35 in 2021. We saw strong increases on F-16. You're starting to see production kick in, and you also had strong sustainment. C-130 sales were up 3%. And so think of that as low single digits. ADP, the Skunkworks is strong double-digit increases there as well. And I'll go to profit for you. So for the quarter, we were up 7%, roughly 10.8% margins versus 10.6%. But F-35, F-35, to your point, was down. That was driven by production. So we had high single-digit margins. I mean, it was almost 10%, but down a little bit versus last year, which were stronger double-digit margins. And that was just, frankly, driven by less risk retirements in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019. Sustainment was up a little bit. F-16 margins for the quarter, George, were up. Both were double-digit margins. But fourth quarter this year, we were almost 20% margins on F-16. That's because we had a risk retirement on an international sustainment program. C-130 margins were up in the fourth quarter as well. And that's because we had risk retirements on our Fyoc 4 and our programs. And ADP was up, and most of that was volume, but we actually -- good news had some risk retirements there as well. So hopefully, that helps give you some color."

I hope you've all had a great start to the new year and that this call finds you and your family safe and healthy.

I hope you've all had a great start to the new year and that this call finds you and your family safe and healthy. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call as we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments and our outlook for 2021. 
Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the loss of Michele Evans, our Aeronautics business area leader who passed away earlier this month. Michele dedicated 34 years of service to our company and touch the lives of countless people, both inside and outside the corporation. I knew Michele for years, and I can say that she lived the life of strength and grace. And while we mourn her loss, we also are thankful to have had her as part of our Lockheed Martin family. We'll all miss Michele. 
As we look back to the year from a broader perspective, 2020 introduced personal and professional challenges to each and every one of us. I'll begin my summary of Lockheed Martin's results today by thanking the men and women of our company and their families for stepping up to deliver outstanding performance during the extremely difficult time. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to drive operational and financial results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations but also set records in several areas. 
The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing pandemic, and we're continuing to take actions to mitigate its impacts. Vaccines are also becoming available to help combat this disease, and we're hopeful for a return to a more normal business environment as we progress throughout the year. Our dedicated workforce and our resilient supply chain continue to perform with excellence during these demanding times, supporting our global customers and their important missions, and I'm very proud of their accomplishments. 
Moving to our results. We delivered another year of outstanding performance in 2020 strategically, operationally and financially. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our full year 2021 financial outlook. But I'd like to provide a few highlights from the past year, a period in which we set high watermarks in sales, earnings and cash from operations. 
First, sales and segment profit each grew 9% over 2019, and our 2020 earnings per share increased by 11%. We had a strong year of cash generation, achieving $8.2 billion of cash from operations even after a $1 billion voluntary pension contribution and after accelerating payments to our supply chain to help mitigate COVID impacts. We are continuing this practice, prioritizing our vulnerable and small business partners. 
We recorded over $68 billion in orders in 2020, growing our backlog by $3 billion, resulting in a robust $147 billion. We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions, investing in innovative technologies, strategic opportunities to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and still returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to defense budgets.  The fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has been passed into legislation, and the Department of Defense appropriations were approved as part of the FY '21 omnibus funding bill. Both of these congressional actions adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which established spending levels for discretionary defense budgets for the total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Also, Congress passed a $900 billion COVID relief package, which extended Section 3610 of the CARES Act to March 31, providing federal agencies the authority to reimburse contractors who are temporarily unable to work due to facility closures or other restrictions. 
Lockheed Martin programs were well supported in the FY '21 appropriations bill with Congress adding funding of over $1.7 billion for 17 additional F-35 aircraft and other development and integration activities for the program, adding nearly $900 million for 9 additional C-130Js plus support work for that airplane; and over $400 million for Sikorsky programs, including additional CH-53K and Black Hawk helicopters; and also the initiation of an 8 THAAD battery for the U.S. Army.
Turning to our portfolio. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements, demonstrating our focus on strategic growth and operational performance. As we announced last month, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne, an action that once finalized will bring long-term strategic value to our entire portfolio. 
As we commented then, our 21st century warfare strategy includes enabling growth areas such as hypersonics, tactical and integrated air and missile defense and space systems domains. Aerojet's expertise in propulsion systems will benefit our existing hypersonic programs as they progress from development to production and will improve our tactical missiles and air and missile defense products, while continuing Aerojet Rocketdyne's legacy as a merchant supplier to the entire industry. 
We believe this combination will deliver innovations and improved efficiencies that will offer more timely and affordable solutions for all of our customers, including the defense department, domestic manufacturers and our international partners. And we're very excited about this transaction. 
Moving to the business areas. In Aeronautics, our F-35 team finished the year strong, delivering a total of 120 F-35 aircraft. Our aero production organization, our partners, teammates in the supply chain all work to overcome manufacturing issues introduced by this pandemic. We've now delivered over 600 airplanes since the program's inception, with nearly 360 jets still in backlog and domestic as well as international opportunities ahead of us. Over 2/3 of the jets on the plan of record are still to be ordered. So the aircraft continues to perform well. So operating from 26 bases and ships around the globe. And the Royal Australian Air Force recently declared initial operating capability in December, the seventh country to do so since the program began. Also in our Aeronautics business, the U.S. Air Force awarded a $900 million contract for us to provide sustainment and support services for F-16 aircraft, including maintenance and modification activities. Of course, the F-16 is one of our longest-running production programs, and we will look to optimize the Air Force's F-16 fleet for greater capability, readiness and performance via this new sustainment contract. 
Moving to our Space business area. We recently won a $4.9 billion award for our next-generation overhead persistent infrared, or OPIR contract. This award funds the production of 3 geosynchronous satellites and ground systems to provide initial warning of ballistic or tactical missile launches anywhere in the world. These new space vehicles will have more powerful sensors and greater resiliency to enhance our nation's air and missile defense capabilities well into the 21st century. 
Keeping with our space organization, we're pleased to be selected for one of the awards to develop a prototype payload for the new evolved strategic satellite communication system. ESS is designed to be the successor to the advanced extremely high-frequency constellation of satellites, one of our signature programs that provide secure and survivable strategic communications for national leaders and tactical commanders alike.
This is our OPIR satellites. The ESS constellation is intended to provide improved resiliency, survivability and increase capabilities. We look forward to participating in this opportunity as we work to enrich our platforms with more mission systems content, which is another key facet of our 21st century warfare strategy.  
I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control business areas, which recently led Lockheed Martin's participation in an exercise, Valiant Shield 2020. which is a biennial joint effort for the U.S. Navy, Army, Air Force and Marine Corps. Our combined team used a virtualized Aegis Weapon System to conduct a pioneering joint multi-domain long fires demonstration. By delivering machine-to-machine interfaces across joint force systems, this effort accelerated speed of decision-making and then the action. It demonstrated a primary premise of our 21st century war fighting strategy by networking separate sensors, communication links and weapons across multiple platforms. The result is more effective joint all-domain operations that provide enhanced capabilities and greater effectiveness to the commander in a field of operations. 
These achievements highlight our strategy to help address emerging threats with 21st century capabilities to invest in new and innovative technologies and leverage our signature programs to provide powerful deterrents to future military conflicts. That's our mission. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year",1138,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year.  
Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share from continuing operations closed with record annual highs. We generated $8.2 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter. And we continued our cash deployment actions, returning $3.9 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in the strategic growth of the business, including acquiring i3 and record investments in IRAD and capital expenditures. We also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne in the fourth quarter, with the close expected in the second half of 2021. I will note that our 2021 outlook includes -- excludes all results associated with this transaction.  
While backlog declined approximately $3 billion in the quarter due primarily to the timing of the F-35 Lot 15 production order, 2020 represented the sixth consecutive annual increase in year-end backlog for the corporation. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business, and Lockheed Martin is well positioned for continued success in 2021.  
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% in 2020 compared with last year to $65.4 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first 3 quarters while segment operating profit also increased 9% over last year to nearly $7.2 billion.  
On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. As Jim mentioned, all 4 of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2020, led by Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control at 11%. Aeronautics growth was driven by development and sustainment increases on F-35 and F-16 as well as growth in advanced development programs. Missiles and Fire Controls growth was primarily from production volume in tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense lines of business. I will note that all 4 of our business areas achieved record highs for sales in 2020.  
Chart 6 shows our earnings per share for 2020. Our EPS from continuing operations of $24.50 was up $2.55 or 12% higher than our results from last year, driven primarily by increased volume and sustained performance.  
On Chart 7, we'll discuss our backlog. Driven by annual increases at 3 of our 4 business areas, we maintained a book-to-bill ratio above 1 for the full year of 2020. This continued backlog growth, combined with further visibility of our 2021 orders, provides additional confidence in our increased sales outlook for 2021.  
On Chart 8, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2020. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $8.2 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow is greater than $6.4 billion, nearly a 6% increase over 2019. This growth was achieved despite accelerating more payments to our supply chain than we received from the favorable DOD initiated progress payment increases and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. 
We increased our dividend by more than 8% and executed our planned share repurchases for the year with $1.1 billion in total shares retired. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $3.9 billion for the year or 60% of free cash flow providing a solid returns to the shareholders in 2020.  
Moving on to Chart 9. We provide our outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $67.1 billion to $68.5 billion. The midpoint of this range represents nearly a 4% increase over 2020, an improvement from our October estimate even after incorporating the impact of the U.K. MOD's decision to in-source contract support for the atomic weapons establishment. The $700 million sales reduction for this change is reflected in our outlook for the Space business. Were not for this decision, our estimated sales increase would have been approximately 5%, which is greater than the estimated 3% sales growth we discussed in the last earnings call. We have incorporated the known COVID impacts into our 2021 financial outlook. We will continue to work with our U.S. government customers to monitor COVID risk to our operations in the supply chain, and we will continue exploring potential paths to recovery of cost impacts where appropriate to minimize future impacts.  
The range for segment operating profit is estimated to be approximately $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. Our estimated FAS/CAS pension adjustment is approximately $2.3 billion. Our estimated range for 2021 earnings per share grows to between $26 to $26.30. The midpoint of this range represents approximately an 8% increase over 2020 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $8.3 billion, and I will discuss this in greater detail on the following chart.  
On Chart 10, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational performance drove a reduction in working capital, which allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2021 to greater than or equal to $8.3 billion. We now see approximately $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2022, increasing our 3-year cash generation estimate by $900 million over our prior assessment. And as we sit here now, we see 2023 cash from operations of approximately $9 billion. I should note, this outlook and trends are prior to an estimated R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act change that would impact 2022 cash by approximately $2.1 billion and lower 2023 cash by approximately $1.8 billion.  
On Chart 11, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All 4 business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2021, approximately 4% for the corporation led by Aeronautics at 5%. Segment operating profit growth is also projected to grow at approximately 4% in the aggregate, with our largest growth in Aeronautics at 6%.  
And finally, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe 2020 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin during these challenging times. Our team diligently worked to minimize the impacts of the pandemic to our business and our supply chain, and we have increased our estimates for 2021 for all key financial metrics. Our results in 2020 exceeded previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation this upcoming year. 
We remain focused on cash generation and growth in 2021. We will continue to invest in discriminating technologies and strategic initiatives to deliver value to our customers while providing strong cash returns to stockholders. 
And with that, we're ready for your questions. Brad?"

285827,700106243,2181698,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Well, Ron, I came into this role with Lockheed Martin being the leader in national security space as it is.

And the benefit of the position of the company is that we have a strong position in the, I'd say, classic large bus, military, defense satellites and then intelligent community satellites, but we also have the ability to go down range into medium and low orbit as well as geosynchronous orbit. 
So the whole playing field in national defense space is open to Lockheed Martin. And what we're doing in the business is we're introducing these 21st century technologies and taking advantage of that space platform. And so you see us winning recently low-orbit transport layer contract, which is a pioneering initiative of the Department of Defense to start introducing 5G and other modern networking technologies into the space domain. We're part of that. 
And what we've been able to do is to connect our Space assets already using some of those newer technologies and AI and also distributing compute into our aerospace, land and sea forces as well, the platforms that we deploy there. So we have a broad space strategy, which is to take 21st century networking, storage and compute technologies into our space domain as really a competitive advantage versus other defense contractors that don't have that asset available to them. 
The second part of your question is, well, how does Aerojet Rocketdyne create value in doing this? And it really goes hand-in-hand with our hypersonic strategy, which is part of our 21st century war fighting initiative. I view Lockheed Martin's benefit or role in defense enterprise as adding velocity to it. The world is moving faster both kinetically, if you will, and in a networking and AI perspective as well. And we need to speed up. And just taking one dimension of that, hypersonic missiles and countering hypersonic missiles, requires a much better, tighter integration of the propulsion system into the body of the missile. The heat generated by these hypersonic missiles is incredible. And just managing that heat and thermal issue is one of the reasons we invested in i3 as well. 
So we are selecting what we think are the most important defense platforms and connectivity capacities for the future of warfare, and we're investing in those. And Aerojet Rocketdyne is part and parcel of that investment strategy. Propulsion integration in the hypersonic missile glide bodies is essential. 
The other benefit of us working in a more integrated fashion with Aerojet Rocketdyne is we'll be able to bring our broad engineering expertise, our capital and our operational experience into Aerojet Rocketdyne and bring the best of Lockheed Martin to the propulsion side of missiles and space. So there are incredible synergies here. I know Ken can speak to a little bit more on those later, both revenue and cost. But given my long answer, I'll stop there."

And so you're going to have, we believe, a lot of continuity and policy and also in focus on how important strong defense is for this country. So I think the proposed team is a plus. 
And unfortunately, frankly, the threat outside against potentially United States is growing. It's accelerating, too, by the way. And when we look at the National Defense Strategy, it reorients itself and reorients our defense enterprise towards great power competition. And it's something you cannot just sit still and watch go by because we will be overtaken because of the aggressiveness of our potential peers. 
So I'm taking solace in these trends as far as the defense budget goes, that you have professional experienced people leading it for the administration and that the threat environment is greater versus lesser. We feel that supports a stable defense budget going forward."

So yes, Joe, I have socialized with you guys as much as we could once we concluded our view of what the tax law, the interpretation of that was.

And as I stated a few times now, it looks like it's about $2.1 billion in 2022, $1.8 billion in 2023, and it will continue trending down. 
One of the reasons we are extremely focused on cash -- you heard in my prepared comments, the amount of cash that we're generating in '22 and '23. I've stated, we've taken -- we took a pause for the -- roughly the second half of last year before we started talking to the key constituents about that impact. It is still our belief that we think there's some likelihood it will either be repealed or altered. So it just doesn't include entire research expenses, which would include our cost plus contracts, but would be just our research and our IRAD, our research and development costs, which would not be a material impact to our -- to the outlooks I gave you. 
We still think there's a good likelihood that's going to happen. Because if you think about it, if in 2022, we have $2.1 billion less of cash -- this is just Lockheed Martin, and as you know, Joe, this is not just Lockheed Martin and not just A&D. This is all of industry. So this is going to hit pharma hard. It's going to hit high-tech hard. These are dollars that we're not going to have the ability to plow back and invest into our portfolio and into our technologies. And I think that is a compelling story. And I think at the end of the day, that's going to rule the day. 
Now having said that, we are still generating large amounts of cash. In fact, as you know, we ended the year in excess of $3 billion cash on hand. Right now, assuming our dividend assumptions and our share repurchase assumptions for 2021, we're going to end 2021 with over $5 billion of cash. That number is going to continue to grow. And that -- frankly, that's a good opportunity for us to do the things Jim described from an investment standpoint and then to continue our robust cash deployment strategy that we have historically had with our shareholders."

When we're successful with the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, I believe they have about 3 million square feet that we would add back. You mentioned, Mike, the Palmdale building that we're building. We also have a little bit of real estate that we're expanding in space and in RMS and in Missiles and Fire Control. And that nets about 1 million square feet. 
So at the end of the day, we're going to be down about 0.5 million squares. But now the opportunity comes. Right now, we have roughly half of our employees working remotely. Some of them are periodically coming in. But we have, over the last couple of months, have rolled out a plan, frankly, looking at Lockheed Martin forward is what we call it. And it's, frankly, the future of work. And we are going to start looking at getting out of some of that lease space as our leases expire. You can expect us to reduce our footprint by at least a couple of million square feet in the next couple of years, if not more. We'll go to more hoteling. We'll allow people that -- where it makes sense for them to work from home, and we'll make sure this is a competitive and strategic advantage for us."

And so I do think that we'll have a more open environment for FMS and direct commercial sales to our international partners. 
The other benefit, you've seen it recently in the press, is that we have some fantastic and unmatched products that are in great demand and highly desired by many countries. So you've seen F-16 sales coming back. F-35 was a pivotal element of the Abraham accords, we believe. And that system is so highly desired by our allies and the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that it actually helped bring a modicum of peace to the Middle East. And so our -- between our products and the Biden administration's stated proclivity to enhance our alliances, I think we're in a better position going forward."

Carter, and unfortunately, I do have to be a little cryptic, and I apologize for that, but I'll try to give you color to the best of my abilities. We have seen our classified business from an order book standpoint and from a sales standpoint growing faster than the corporation. 
If you go around the horn, I've mentioned in the past, we won a strategic program in Palmdale where we're starting to see the benefits of multiple customers starting to want that system. In fact, we're also in conversation with an international partner of the United States of their interest in that system. And back to Mike's question, that's the reason for the capital growth out in Palmdale. 
There is some other things going on out there that, unfortunately, we can't talk about that I think we'll reap the benefits of. Some of them are hypersonics. Some of them are other platforms. At Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the large development program that we won. It is progressing well. It's going to continue to grow in the future probably as fast, if not faster than the rest of Missiles and Fire Control. And then probably the other big place to talk is space. We won a couple rather large strategic programs in 2020. We're also pursuing a few in 2021. 
And also the -- from a sales standpoint, as I mentioned, for across the corporation, growing faster than top line than our business in the aggregate is. 
From a margin standpoint, margins in Aeronautics for Palmdale, the classified work right now, is dilutive just by the nature of the contract types. Same with Missiles and Fire Control. These programs are going to be dilutive -- growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, but from a margin standpoint going to be dilutive. The good news also is -- but from a contract-type standpoint, they're not an impact to working capital. So there'll be a reasonably good cash flow. 
In the Space business, some of these programs are fixed price, but most of them are going to be cost-plus as well. So just slightly dilutive to the overall portfolio. But again, I apologize. That's about as much as I could say about the portfolio."

We see -- right now, we see margins pretty steady at 11%. So most of that is -- I've talked to Wall Street about our focus on cash, what we've called it as a culture of cash where generally over the last couple of years, it's not just, frankly, a balance sheet issue. It's not the finance community just to solve. It's the entire corporation where, say, production operations understands the consequences of making or missing deliveries and how that impacts cash. 
So we see more opportunities going forward managing the balance sheet, specifically contract assets and inventory and ensuring that if they're going to grow, they're growing at the most efficient way possible. 
And then also, as Jim mentioned, we see opportunities. I'm not going to talk about specifically FMS, but probably more direct government sales where there's an opportunity for us to get cash advances. 
To answer your second part of your question, we do see some opportunity, though, to be better than 11%. And that's specifically, our programs that will start to mature. Pick F-16. We're generally in the beginning of the production cycle again. We're going to deliver 8 airplanes in 2022. And then we'll get up to a significant double-digit deliveries in '23 and beyond. There is an opportunity for us to have margin improvement there. 
F-35. Everybody wants to talk about F-35. We do still think there's opportunities there from a margin standpoint with production. We've talked to you about the PBL concept to the -- performance-based logistics concept that we've had, that we do think there's some margin opportunity there for industry assuming we perform, assuming we hit the critical service level agreements that we want. 
Hypersonics will soon get out of development and hopefully go into a limited rate production and production that will help us. All the helicopter programs that we've talked about, you'll start to see CH-53K, moving out of development into production. Presidential helicopter, of course, is moving into production. You have combat search and rescue that will move into production. Those are just a couple of examples, Sheila, I think that will give us an opportunity to enhance our margin over time."

I mean if you go all the way back to the primary notion that we're back into a world of great power competition, it's important to look, I think, beyond our own defense industrial base structure, but outward to those of the competitors, which are China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, for example. 
And compare our capabilities in the -- if I'm in government, comparing our defense industrial-based capabilities to those of the peer group, how does China operate its defense industrial base, how does it organize it and what are the capabilities and velocity again that comes from that. And from that perspective, my view would be that vertical integration concerns from a classic antitrust perspective are dwarfed by the lack of velocity and inability to integrate an added cost, frankly, that comes from the existing defense industrial base structure that's stratified with a supply chain that's quite fragmented. 
I think it's better for the country and for the defense enterprise to enable industry to make logical proposals for bringing in the mission systems, if you will, the supply chain that goes into major platforms into a more integrated organization. 
So I think that's the philosophical basis. On the other hand, we cannot predict the decisions of individual regulators and those coming into office. But I do think that it's critical that those decisions look through the lens of great power competition and how we compare to the defense industrial base, certainly, of China."

But if you look at our hypersonics portfolio through 2020, our total order book was north of $3 billion. We generated about $1.2 billion in hypersonics sales in 2020. And think of that as mostly development and cost-plus programs. And actually, we had a couple of risk retirements at the end of the year. So our programs are performing. 
For 2021, Noah, the best of our abilities, right now, we see hypersonic sales being about $1.5 billion and still dilutive margins just based on contract type and the type of work that's being done. We're going to have a handful of these programs. We'll have first launch, continued demonstration of capabilities this year and next year. And then as I've stated in the past, you'll start seeing some of these programs neck down, as you saw last year where we had one program terminated but we actually saw the funding start to go to some of our other platforms. So for us, really not a harm and intuitively made sense. 
So by the middle of the decade, it's conceivable that, that number could be closer to $3 billion. You'll start to see some of these limited rate production programs happening. Some of these programs will actually start going into full scale production. So it's conceivable that our sales will more than double by the middle of this decade.

And there are no better source of jobs in international military sales for this country and -- in large part because these are -- tend to be engineering, STEM, high salary; and the manufacturing jobs also, high wage reliable, dependable jobs with companies that have strong benefits, et cetera. 
So if jobs in the economy are important, the promotion of international defense sales, one would surmise, would also be important. So from that perspective, I expect that we're going to get strong support, let alone from, as I mentioned earlier, the interest and desire to have increased collaboration, cooperation with our allies. 
And as an ex-pilot myself, I can tell you that there's no better way to get a tighter bond with an ally than sell them jet aircraft, fighter aircraft. Because all the way back in the mid-80s when I was in pilot training, we had Saudis in our class, for example. Then when I was at Pratt & Whitney, we built an F100 engine overhaul and repair shop in Saudi Arabia that further cemented our collaboration with that country is just 2 tiny examples. 
And then you've got, again, the training, collaboration. You've got industrial collaboration. You're doing exercises together. You're using the same cockpit avionics, just goes on and on how you can increase your alliance stickiness, if you will, with major defense sales.

Generally, they were mid-single-digit increases, and that was driven by follow-on modernization. I mean we're still seeing a lot of success there, a lot of demand by our customer set for increased technology on the platform. 
Production was down in the quarter, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, George, and that was mid-single digits as well. That was probably more of a timing issue than anything else. The statement, we saw strong growth, and we're going to see strong growth into 2021. That will be the fastest-growing piece of F-35 in 2021. We saw strong increases on F-16. You're starting to see production kick in, and you also had strong sustainment. C-130 sales were up 3%, so think of that as low single digits. ADP, the Skunk Works is strong double-digit increases there as well. 
And I'll go to profit for you. So for the quarter, we were up 7%, roughly 10.8% margins versus 10.6%. But F-35, F-35, to your point, was down. That was driven by production. So we had high single-digit margins. I mean it was almost 10%, but down a little bit versus last year, which were stronger double-digit margins. And that was just, frankly, driven by less risk retirements in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019. Sustainment was up a little bit. 
F-16 margins for the quarter, George, were up. Both were double-digit margins. But fourth quarter this year, we were almost 20% margins on F-16. That's because we had a risk retirement on an international sustainment program. C-130 margins were up in the fourth quarter as well. And that's because we had risk retirements on our FIOC 4 and our programs. And ADP was up. And most of that was volume, but we actually -- good news had some risk retirements there as well. So hopefully, that helps give you some color."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and ope",1571,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services, and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times. 
I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products and support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customers. which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case. 
Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the [ Hart-Scott-Rodino Act ]. We're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021. 
Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. 
But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right upfront. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance. And earnings per share also saw strong growth. 
Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early-stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments. 
Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. 
We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. 
Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations. 
Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and secure next-gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic. 
Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks. 
Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy air class, including the F-22 and U2, with long -- land-based long-range fires, naval fires and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapons. Our team was on the vanguard of the [indiscernible], enabling F-35s and F-22 to pass data to a U2 all Lockheed Martin aircraft with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships. 
By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information can be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness and to rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept. 
In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift [ helicopter ] competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53K to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement. 
In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision Fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships has lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 [indiscernible] systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs. 
Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, 5-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity. 
Our Space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm omni space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology, tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains. 
We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our [ 5G dot mill ] initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century. 
I'll close by again highlighting our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the Mars 2020 [ Aero Shell ], which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere. 
Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built [ aeroshell ] systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s. 
We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with a perseverance program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next-gen technologies and our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial national security missions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
285827,710052985,2253854,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw str",907,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. 
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments. 
With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, We are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics. 
And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture space. 
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year driven by volume, and as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide. 
This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business. 
On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter. 
And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for the current years for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. 
On Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 and projected to increase year-over-year by 4%. 
On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS in our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology and early-stage companies, and their valuations may fluctuate over time. 
Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS. We as has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range. 
On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. 
In total, this change in legislation increases our 3-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022. 
And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our 3-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion. 
And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

Some of it planned and frankly, some of it",414,"Sure. Rob, it's Ken. I'll start off with your long-term question regarding top line growth. So Everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it nice surprises. So if you go around the horn -- if you look at our national security space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned. And frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space. 
From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there -- that program will be developing and demonstrating [indiscernible] enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there. 
I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about 2/3 of that is in our space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other 2 business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with omni space that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us this space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment."

So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the -- largely commercial team, led by [ Blue Org ] and the national team on the moon lander. That -- our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with [ Blue Org ]. 
On the other hand, we've got we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the [ Artemis ] missions going forward. So we've got a great position there.

Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of 4 or 5 main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative. 
And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really 4 or 5 elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we -- it's imperative. again, we established what we call a 5G.MIL network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands, we're going to employ ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside side the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. One of the things that, frankly, is core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulation, and I do feel we can be a bridge during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand the way they're used to working, and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. But the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it, and we are. 
The second thing is We really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the 2 industries with our customer. But we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community. There are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than a standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just 1 idea, but we need to start working with our customer more closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives. 
The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is, we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software-defined network protocols that we intend to use. We're going to have to work with them on that. 
Now why that's important is because currently, the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done. 
So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there, too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving towards this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders. There's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this."

So what I'll start with is the ex Air Force pilot and haven't spoken Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter pla",443,"Sure. So what I'll start with is the ex Air Force pilot and haven't spoken Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the head of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battle deal. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power And the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter. 
So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. And it's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anywhere else. Having said all that, we are working on all 3 dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved -- the company has already achieved the goal of $80million F-35A,and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that. 
And then sustainment is also key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our joint program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field to get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, et cetera, and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain. 
I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all 3 dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem is achievable."

We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above [ 1 ], and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the 2 worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, There is -- just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries. 
The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes. It's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner in percentage of aircraft starts getting close to roughly 50%. And so we still see continued demand there. 
We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K. That's Lot 5. We're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just -- I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationale for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the -- that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate. 
So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now."

When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense. I think there's really 4 important points to make. One is The Biden administration clearly recognizes that we're all in the year of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect."

The main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was -- and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit -- it hit already. So it hit in the month of April. So it was just -- that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter. Basically, F-35 was generally down And that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat. And sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter -- in the upcoming quarters. And new fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there -- all 3 of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than our first quarter. So thanks for the question."

So Yes, I think it's probably best we go around each of the 4 business areas. So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the 3 elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we and our partner companies are working on. So We still see development being a decent size -- relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it. which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of our -- of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to -- and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIP. There should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this part of the portfolio, and it will continue to grow. I mean we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be -- we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept And we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog. 5 customers. We have -- we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver 8 aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about 3, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be -- and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our skunkworks. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified. A lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. 
Missiles and Fire Control. I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there. 
At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have the down-select on FLORA and FARA and we're bullish on those And by the end of this decade, it will start -- they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, space. Space. If it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some -- based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today."

First and foremost, we're going to generate as much cash as we can, and that was one of the rationale of why we decided to start deferring our ERISA funding in 2021 from an economic standpoint. That made the most sense. But first and foremost, we're going to invest in our business, whether that's organic or inorganically. We have still some decent-sized capital outlays this year of, rough numbers, about $1.8 billion. We're at record levels of IRAD spend this year, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll -- this -- again, we'll focus on organic. And then inorganically, in Jim's prepared statements, we talked about Aerojet Rocketdyne. That's on track. We just got our second request from the FTC, which is no surprise. Nothing has changed. We're still very bullish about that for that to come to resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. And then it comes down to the excess cash, what do we do with it? We are focused on our dividend strategy. That would be the next in the batting order. We're going to -- in the third quarter, Jim and I will go see the Board with our Treasurer, John Millard, to make a recommendation on what's the appropriate increase in our dividends. And it should be deemed favorable to our shareholders. And then lastly, it's share buybacks. And frankly, Rich, what we saw in the first quarter where our stock was trading, we thought it was grossly undervalued, and we went into this accelerated share buyback plan and deemed to be very successful. And we will opportunistically, in the next 3 quarters, buy back stock where it makes sense. And think of that as anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in the next 3 months. We have the balance sheet to do everything I just described, and we'll continue evaluating that. And I'll hand it over to Jim to talk about if there's any other investments in -- I think you mentioned ABL and other type opportunities out there."

And going back to that overall strategic framework that I outlined earlier. You hear a lot in there about partnering with leading technology companies, leveraging commercial industry research and development investments. They've already made or are making to reduce our costs that we then transmit to our customer. So we want to use the full range of transactional options with inclusive of our defense industrial-based colleagues that we're used to dealing with, but well beyond that, right? So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. And then full on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture But it will be thoughtful. It will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction of R&D that's already been made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this. 
Someone that's already going to invest in low-earth orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that -- their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the CapEx investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement."

I think a little bit goes back to what George was asking me in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of it. So I would say on production, we're down -- it's -- I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole -- and this goes back to the earlier conversation, this in some ways is -- for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have. We continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology. But I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat production. just based on -- if you think about production revenues. It's really not for the -- for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for, for this year. And we're fairly confident -- we're very confident, I should say, in the stream and the flow of what's going on. So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the -- close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 -- I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter of where the rest of aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was. The team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial result this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times.  
I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products and support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customers. which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case.  
Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the Hart–Scott–Rodino Act, we're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021.  
Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right upfront. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance, and earnings per share also saw strong growth.  
Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early-stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments.  
Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. 
We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we can't -- plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy, providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations.  
Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and secure next-gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic.  
Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks.  
Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy air class, including the F-22 and U2, with long -- land-based long-range flyers, naval flyers and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapon systems. Our team was on the vanguard of the effort, enabling F-35s and F-22s to pass data to a U2, all Lockheed Martin aircraft, with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships.  
By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information could be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness into a rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept.  
In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift helicopter competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53K to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement.  
In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships that has lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 GMLRS systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs.  
Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, 5-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity.  
Our space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm Omnispace space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology.  
Tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains.  
We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our 5G.MIL initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century.  
I'll close by again highlighting our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin space designed and built the Mars 2020 aeroshell, which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere.  
Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built aeroshell systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s.  
We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with a Perseverance program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next-gen technologies. And our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial national security missions.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
285827,710052985,2253931,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today.  Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw st",909,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today.  
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments.  
With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, We are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics.  
And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture at Space.  
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year driven by volume, and as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide.  
This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business.  
On Chart 6, we'll discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter.  
And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for this current year for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.  
On our -- on Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 and projected to increase year-over-year by 4%.  
On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS and our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology in early-stage companies and their valuations may fluctuate over time.  
Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS. As has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range.  
On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. In total, this change in legislation increases our 3-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022.  
And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our 3-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion.  
And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

So everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our Space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it's nice surprises. So if you go around the horn -- if you look at our national security space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned, and frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space.  
From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there. That program will be developing and demonstrating JADO-enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there.  
I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about 2/3 of that is in our Space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other 2 business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with Omnispace that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. 
And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us this space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment."

So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the -- largely commercial team, led by Blue Origin and the national team on the moon lander. that our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with Blue Origin.  
On the other hand, we've got we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the Artemis missions going forward. So we've got a great position there. We'll continue to work with whether it's Omnispace or others, Blue Origin, SpaceX, whatever makes sense for us from a partnership /competition perspective, we're going to play, and we're going to be there.

Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of 4 or 5 main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative.  
And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really 4 or 5 elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we -- it's imperative. again, we established what we call a 5G.MIL network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands, we're going to employ, ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside and outside the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. 
One of the things that, frankly, is core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulation, and I do feel we can be a bridge during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand the way they're used to working, and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. So the -- but the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it, and we are.  
The second thing is we really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the 2 industries with our customer. But we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community. There are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than a standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just 1 idea, but we need to start working with our customer more closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives.  
The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is, we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software-defined network protocols that we intend to use. We're going to have to work with them on that.  
Now why that's important is because currently, the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done.  
So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, Seth, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there, too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving towards this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders, there's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this."

So what I'll start with as and ex Air Force pilot and having spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter p",447,"Sure. So what I'll start with as and ex Air Force pilot and having spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the ahead of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battle deal. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power and the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter.  
So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. And it's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anyone else. Having said all that, we are working on all 3 dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved -- the company has already achieved the goal of $80 million F-35A, and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that.  
And then sustainment is also a key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our joint program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field. To get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, et cetera, and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain.  
I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all 3 dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem is achievable."

We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above 1, and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the 2 worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, There is -- just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries.  
The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes, it's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner in FMS percentage of aircraft that starts getting close to roughly 50%. And we - so we still see continued demand there.  
We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K, that's Lot 5, we're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the Space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just -- I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationale for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the -- that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate.  
So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now."

When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense. I think there's really 4 important points to make. One is The Biden administration it clearly recognizes that we're all in the era of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State, Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect."

The main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was -- and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit -- it hit already, so it hit in the month of April. So it was just -- that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter. Basically, F-35 was generally down and that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat, and sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter -- in the upcoming quarters. And new fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there -- all 3 of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than than our first quarter. So thanks for the question."

So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the 3 elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we -- and our partner companies are working on. So we still see development being a decent size, relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it. which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of our -- of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to -- and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIP. There should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this part of the portfolio, and it'll continue to grow. I mean we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. 
We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be -- we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept. And we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog. 5 customers. We have -- we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver 8 aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about 3, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be -- and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our Skunk Works. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified, a lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. 
Missiles and Fire Control. I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there.  
At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have the down-select on FLRAA and FARA and we're bullish on those. And by the end of this decade, it will start -- they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, space. Space, if it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core Space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some -- based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today."

First and foremost, we're going to generate as much cash as we can, and that was one of the rationale of why we decided to start deferring our ERISA funding in 2021 from an economic standpoint. That made the most sense. But first and foremost, we're going to invest in our business, whether that's organic or inorganically. We have still some decent-sized capital outlays this year of, rough numbers, about $1.8 billion. We're at record levels of IRAD spends this year, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll -- this is -- again, we'll focus on organic. And then inorganically, in Jim's prepared statements, we talked about Aerojet Rocketdyne. That's on track. We just got our second request from the FTC, which is no surprise, nothing has changed. We're still very bullish about that -- for that to come to resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. 
And then it comes down to the excess cash, what do we do with it? We are focused on our dividend strategy that would be the next in the batting order. We're going to -- in the third quarter, Jim and I will go see the Board with our Treasurer, John Millard, to make a recommendation on what's the appropriate increase in our dividends. And it should be deemed favorable to our shareholders. And then lastly, it's share buybacks. And frankly, Rich, what we saw in the first quarter where our stock was trading, we thought it was grossly undervalued, and we went into this accelerated share buyback plan and deemed to be very successful. And we will opportunistically, in the next 3 quarters, buy back stock where it makes sense. And think of that as anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in the next 3 months. We have the balance sheet to do everything I just described, and we'll continue evaluating that.

And going back to that overall strategic framework that I outlined earlier. You hear a lot in there about partnering with leading technology companies, leveraging commercial industry research and development investments. They've already made make -- made or are making to reduce our costs that we then transmit to our customer. So we want to use the full range of transactional options with inclusive of our defense industrial-based colleagues that we're used to dealing with, but well beyond that, right? So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, the joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. 
And then full on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture. But it will be thoughtful, it will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction, of R&D that's already been made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this. 
Someone that's already going to invest in low-earth orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that -- their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the CapEx investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement."

And the question you asked for when do we look at getting out of those type investments?

We would just make a determination when it makes sense for that modest investment in them that we have, whether it makes sense for us to get out or not and just continue to utilize their technologies."

I think a little bit goes back to what George was asking me in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of it. So I would say on production, we're down -- it's -- I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole -- and this goes back to the earlier conversation, this in some ways is -- for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have. We continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology, but I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat. Production just based on -- if you think about production revenues. It's really not for the -- for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for, for this year. And we're fairly confident -- we're very confident, I should say, in the stream, in the flow of what's going on. 
So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that, that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the -- close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 -- I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter where the rest of Aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is, it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was because the team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial result this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times.  
I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products and support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customers. which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case.  
Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the Hart–Scott–Rodino Act, we're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021.  
Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right upfront. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance, and earnings per share also saw strong growth.  
Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early-stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments.  
Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. 
We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we can't -- plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy, providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations.  
Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and secure next-gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic.  
Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks.  
Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy air class, including the F-22 and U2, with long -- land-based long-range flyers, naval flyers and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapon systems. Our team was on the vanguard of the effort, enabling F-35s and F-22s to pass data to a U2, all Lockheed Martin aircraft, with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships.  
By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information could be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness into a rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept.  
In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift helicopter competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53K to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement.  
In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships that has lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 GMLRS systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs.  
Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, 5-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity.  
Our space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm Omnispace space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology.  
Tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains.  
We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our 5G.MIL initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century.  
I'll close by again highlighting our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin space designed and built the Mars 2020 aeroshell, which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere.  
Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built aeroshell systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s.  
We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with a Perseverance program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next-gen technologies. And our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial national security missions.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
285827,710052985,2254087,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today.  Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw st",909,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today.  
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments.  
With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, We are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics.  
And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture at Space.  
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year driven by volume, and as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide.  
This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business.  
On Chart 6, we'll discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter.  
And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for this current year for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations.  
On our -- on Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 and projected to increase year-over-year by 4%.  
On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS and our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology in early-stage companies and their valuations may fluctuate over time.  
Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS. As has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range.  
On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. In total, this change in legislation increases our 3-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022.  
And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our 3-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion.  
And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

So everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our Space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it's nice surprises. So if you go around the horn -- if you look at our national security space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned, and frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space.  
From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there. That program will be developing and demonstrating JADO-enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there.  
I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about 2/3 of that is in our Space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other 2 business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with Omnispace that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. 
And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us this space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment."

So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the -- largely commercial team, led by Blue Origin and the national team on the moon lander. that our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with Blue Origin.  
On the other hand, we've got we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the Artemis missions going forward. So we've got a great position there. We'll continue to work with whether it's Omnispace or others, Blue Origin, SpaceX, whatever makes sense for us from a partnership /competition perspective, we're going to play, and we're going to be there.

So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative.  
And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really 4 or 5 elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we -- it's imperative. again, we established what we call a 5G.MIL network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands, we're going to employ, ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside and outside the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. 
One of the things that, frankly, is core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulation, and I do feel we can be a bridge during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand the way they're used to working, and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. So the -- but the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it, and we are.  
The second thing is we really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the 2 industries with our customer. But we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community. There are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than a standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just 1 idea, but we need to start working with our customer more closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives.  
The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is, we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software-defined network protocols that we intend to use. We're going to have to work with them on that.  
Now why that's important is because currently, the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done.  
So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, Seth, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there, too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving towards this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders, there's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this."

So what I'll start with as and ex Air Force pilot and having spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter p",447,"Sure. So what I'll start with as and ex Air Force pilot and having spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the ahead of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battle deal. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power and the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter.  
So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. And it's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anyone else. Having said all that, we are working on all 3 dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved -- the company has already achieved the goal of $80 million F-35A, and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that.  
And then sustainment is also a key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our joint program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field. To get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, et cetera, and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain.  
I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all 3 dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem is achievable."

We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above 1, and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the 2 worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, There is -- just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries.  
The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes, it's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner in FMS percentage of aircraft that starts getting close to roughly 50%. And we - so we still see continued demand there.  
We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K, that's Lot 5, we're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the Space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just -- I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationale for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the -- that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate.  
So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now."

When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense. I think there's really 4 important points to make. One is The Biden administration it clearly recognizes that we're all in the era of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State, Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect."

The main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was -- and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit -- it hit already, so it hit in the month of April. So it was just -- that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter. Basically, F-35 was generally down and that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat, and sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter -- in the upcoming quarters. And new fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there -- all 3 of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than than our first quarter. So thanks for the question."

So Yes, I think it's probably best we go around each of the 4 business areas. So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the 3 elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we -- and our partner companies are working on. So we still see development being a decent size, relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it. which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of our -- of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to -- and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIP. There should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this part of the portfolio, and it'll continue to grow. I mean we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. 
We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be -- we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept. And we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog. 5 customers. We have -- we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver 8 aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about 3, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be -- and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our Skunk Works. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified, a lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. 
Missiles and Fire Control. I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there.  
At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have the down-select on FLRAA and FARA and we're bullish on those. And by the end of this decade, it will start -- they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, space. Space, if it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core Space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some -- based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today."

First and foremost, we're going to generate as much cash as we can, and that was one of the rationale of why we decided to start deferring our ERISA funding in 2021 from an economic standpoint. That made the most sense. But first and foremost, we're going to invest in our business, whether that's organic or inorganically. We have still some decent-sized capital outlays this year of, rough numbers, about $1.8 billion. We're at record levels of IRAD spends this year, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll -- this is -- again, we'll focus on organic. And then inorganically, in Jim's prepared statements, we talked about Aerojet Rocketdyne. That's on track. We just got our second request from the FTC, which is no surprise, nothing has changed. We're still very bullish about that -- for that to come to resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. 
And then it comes down to the excess cash, what do we do with it? We are focused on our dividend strategy that would be the next in the batting order. We're going to -- in the third quarter, Jim and I will go see the Board with our Treasurer, John Millard, to make a recommendation on what's the appropriate increase in our dividends. And it should be deemed favorable to our shareholders. And then lastly, it's share buybacks. And frankly, Rich, what we saw in the first quarter where our stock was trading, we thought it was grossly undervalued, and we went into this accelerated share buyback plan and deemed to be very successful. And we will opportunistically, in the next 3 quarters, buy back stock where it makes sense. And think of that as anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in the next 3 months. We have the balance sheet to do everything I just described, and we'll continue evaluating that. And I'll hand it over to Jim to talk about if there's any other investments in -- I think you mentioned ABL and other type opportunities out there."

And going back to that overall strategic framework that I outlined earlier. You hear a lot in there about partnering with leading technology companies, leveraging commercial industry research and development investments. They've already made make -- made or are making to reduce our costs that we then transmit to our customer. So we want to use the full range of transactional options with inclusive of our defense industrial-based colleagues that we're used to dealing with, but well beyond that, right? So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, the joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. 
And then full on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture. But it will be thoughtful, it will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction, of R&D that's already been made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this. 
Someone that's already going to invest in low-earth orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that -- their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the CapEx investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement."

What we basically agreed to is to commit to a range of launch vehicles. And think of this for lower-level satellites that don't require the horsepower of, say, our United Launch Alliance. The only investment we do have is it's in our Ventures group. And think of that as this is more for the technology that they bring to make our products better. And it's a relatively modest -- that's a relatively modest investment. So I'm not sure I would look at it as something that -- from an acquisition standpoint. And the question you asked for when do we look at getting out of those type investments? So we did -- as you heard, we did have some investments that actually went public, that allowed us to make a gain. Some of those are SPACs, which we're going to be required to hold, and then we'll make a determination whether it makes sense for Lockheed Martin to get out of those ventures, but then to continue to utilize that technology. And just as an example, ABL, we would do something very similar. And again, I'm not suggesting that whether they're public or not. We would just make a determination when it makes sense for that modest investment in them that we have, whether it makes sense for us to get out or not and just continue to utilize their technologies."

I think a little bit goes back to what George was asking me in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of it. So I would say on production, we're down -- it's -- I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole -- and this goes back to the earlier conversation, this in some ways is -- for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have. We continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology, but I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat. Production just based on -- if you think about production revenues. It's really not for the -- for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for, for this year. And we're fairly confident -- we're very confident, I should say, in the stream, in the flow of what's going on. 
So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that, that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the -- close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 -- I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter where the rest of Aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is, it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was because the team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and ope",1571,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services, and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times. 
I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products and support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customers. which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case. 
Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the [ Hart-Scott-Rodino Act ]. We're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021. 
Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. 
But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right upfront. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance. And earnings per share also saw strong growth. 
Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early-stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments. 
Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. 
We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. 
Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations. 
Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and secure next-gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic. 
Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks. 
Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy air class, including the F-22 and U2, with long -- land-based long-range fires, naval fires and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapons. Our team was on the vanguard of the [indiscernible], enabling F-35s and F-22 to pass data to a U2 all Lockheed Martin aircraft with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships. 
By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information can be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness and to rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept. 
In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift [ helicopter ] competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53K to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement. 
In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision Fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships has lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 [indiscernible] systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs. 
Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, 5-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity. 
Our Space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm omni space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology, tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains. 
We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our [ 5G dot mill ] initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century. 
I'll close by again highlighting our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the Mars 2020 [ Aero Shell ], which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere. 
Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built [ aeroshell ] systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s. 
We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with a perseverance program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next-gen technologies and our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial national security missions. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
285827,710052985,2254088,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw str",907,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. 
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments. 
With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, We are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics. 
And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture space. 
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year driven by volume, and as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide. 
This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business. 
On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter. 
And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for the current years for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. 
On Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 and projected to increase year-over-year by 4%. 
On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS in our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology and early-stage companies, and their valuations may fluctuate over time. 
Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS. We as has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range. 
On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. 
In total, this change in legislation increases our 3-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022. 
And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our 3-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion. 
And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

So Everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it nice surprises. So if you go around the horn -- if you look at our national security space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned. And frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space. 
From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there -- that program will be developing and demonstrating [indiscernible] enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there. 
I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about 2/3 of that is in our space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other 2 business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with omni space that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us this space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment."

So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the -- largely commercial team, led by [ Blue Org ] and the national team on the moon lander. That -- our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with [ Blue Org ]. 
On the other hand, we've got we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the [ Artemis ] missions going forward. So we've got a great position there.

Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of 4 or 5 main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our obje",860,"Sure. Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of 4 or 5 main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative. 
And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really 4 or 5 elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we -- it's imperative. again, we established what we call a 5G.MIL network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands, we're going to employ ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside side the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. One of the things that, frankly, is core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulation, and I do feel we can be a bridge during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand the way they're used to working, and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. But the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it, and we are. 
The second thing is We really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the 2 industries with our customer. But we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community. There are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than a standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just 1 idea, but we need to start working with our customer more closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives. 
The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is, we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software-defined network protocols that we intend to use. We're going to have to work with them on that. 
Now why that's important is because currently, the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done. 
So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there, too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving towards this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders. There's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this."

So what I'll start with is the ex Air Force pilot and haven't spoken Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter pla",443,"Sure. So what I'll start with is the ex Air Force pilot and haven't spoken Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States. This aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the head of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battle deal. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power And the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter. 
So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. And it's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anywhere else. Having said all that, we are working on all 3 dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved -- the company has already achieved the goal of $80million F-35A,and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that. 
And then sustainment is also key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our joint program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field to get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, et cetera, and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain. 
I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all 3 dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem is achievable."

We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above [ 1 ], and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the 2 worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, There is -- just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries. 
The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes. It's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner in percentage of aircraft starts getting close to roughly 50%. And so we still see continued demand there. 
We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K. That's Lot 5. We're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just -- I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationale for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the -- that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate. 
So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now."

When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense. I think there's really 4 important points to make. One is The Biden administration clearly recognizes that we're all in the year of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect."

The main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was -- and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit -- it hit already. So it hit in the month of April. So it was just -- that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter. Basically, F-35 was generally down And that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat. And sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter -- in the upcoming quarters. And new fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there -- all 3 of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than our first quarter. So thanks for the question."

So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the 3 elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we and our partner companies are working on. So We still see development being a decent size -- relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it. which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of our -- of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to -- and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIP. There should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this part of the portfolio, and it will continue to grow. I mean we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be -- we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept And we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog. 5 customers. We have -- we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver 8 aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about 3, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be -- and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our skunkworks. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified. A lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. 
Missiles and Fire Control. I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there. 
At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have the down-select on FLORA and FARA and we're bullish on those And by the end of this decade, it will start -- they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, space. Space. If it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some -- based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today."

So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. And then full on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture But it will be thoughtful. It will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction of R&D that's already been made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this. 
Someone that's already going to invest in low-earth orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that -- their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the CapEx investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement."

And it's a relatively modest -- that's a relatively modest investment. So I'm not sure I would look at it as something that from an acquisition standpoint. And the question you asked for When do we look at getting out of those type investments. So we did -- as you heard, we did have some investments that actually went public, that allowed us to make a gain. Some of those are back, which we're going to be required to hold, and then we'll make a determination whether it makes sense for Lockheed Martin to get out of those ventures, but then to continue to utilize that technology. And just as an example, ABL, we would do something very similar. And again, I'm not suggesting that whether they're public or not. We would just make a determination when it makes sense for that modest investment in them that we have, whether it makes sense for us to get out or not and just continue to utilize their technologies."

So I would say on production, we're down -- it's -- I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole -- and this goes back to the earlier conversation, this in some ways is -- for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have. We continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology. But I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat production. just based on -- if you think about production revenues. It's really not for the -- for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for, for this year. And we're fairly confident -- we're very confident, I should say, in the stream and the flow of what's going on. So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the -- close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 -- I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter of where the rest of aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was. The team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'll begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on our financial results, which Ken will elaborate on in a few minutes. 
Our second quarter sales increased 5% over last year's second quarter as each business area exceeded 2020 levels, led by our Space team. Our Space business grew over 10% this quarter due to growth in hypersonics; next-generation overhead persistent infrared or OPIR satellite activities; and increased support provided to the U.K. Ministry of Defense's Atomic Weapons Establishment program, which will close out our management of that activity. 
Our segment operating profit was impacted this quarter by a onetime charge associated with the classified program in our Aeronautics business area. While the classified nature of this program precludes us from discussing this matter in depth, we can say that our customer is highly attracted to the capabilities that we are developing on their behalf, that we're committed to delivering these capabilities and that the long-term potential of this solution is significant for the company. 
Our cash generation remains strong, driving $1.3 billion of cash from operations this quarter, after making $1.4 billion of accelerated payments to our supply base as we continue to mitigate the risks brought on by COVID-19 for our supply chain. Our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet gave us the ability to complete a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter, in addition to the $1 billion ASR executed last quarter, thereby bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $1.5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to continue driving strong cash generation and supporting balanced cash deployment actions, including investing in key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to shareholders. 
Turning to budgets. The White House submitted their fiscal year 2022 budget proposal to Congress, requesting $715 billion for the Department of Defense, an $11 billion increase from the FY '21 enacted budget. Our programs continue to be well supported, including over $12 billion for the F-35 program, approximately $3.5 billion for our signature Sikorsky helicopters and over $2 billion for hypersonics programs. The President's budget request prioritizes funding for innovation and modernization as well, in recognition of the need to invest in technologies and capabilities to address the great power competition the nation now faces. 
These include areas of strength within the Lockheed Martin portfolio such as continued support for air and missile defense programs; FAD PAC-3 and our recent next-generation interceptor award; space domain initiatives, including OPIR and GPS III satellites; and the Space development agencies transport layer architecture. The Defense Department request also focused on investments in advanced capability enablers. We believe this vision of deterrence and innovation is well aligned with our broad portfolio and our 21st Century Warfare vision. 
In congressional March to date of the FY '22 defense budget request, we continue to see strong support from the Hill for all of our programs, which include increases for F-35, C-130, CH-53K and UH-60 programs, and fully approved budget requests for many of our other systems. 
Turning to some strategic and operational achievements from this quarter, I'd like to begin by highlighting the company's participation in Northern Edge 21, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command exercise in support of the Pacific Deterrence initiative. This live exercise included multiple U.S. military services across a very wide geographic area with a goal of enhancing joint interoperability between the services and the various domains that they operate in. Signature programs from all 4 of our business areas participated in this event, and we successfully demonstrated joint all-domain command and control known as JADC2. We demonstrated capabilities such as enhanced situational awareness by integrating sensors across land, sea, air and space, for example. 
Among our successful demonstrations of JADC2 during the exercise was, one, enabling Aegis and PAC-3 MSC integration for an integrated air and missile defense against advanced threats; also using the F-35 to provide real-time tracking and targeting data generated near San Diego during a flight to the all-domain operations center in Alaska for prosecution and fire control; also facilitating space-based connectivity at the same time using the MUOS narrowband satellite communications constellation; and also supporting the Air National Guard demonstration of a new data link capability with our lesion pod, which integrates our infrared search-and-track targeting sensor technology into that broader network. 
The Northern Edge exercise demonstrated our integrated offensive and defensive fires capability, our satellite communication links as well as the ability to adapt joint battle management concepts in real time. 
One of my goals in the first year as CEO of Lockheed Martin was to actually demonstrate the benefits of network effects to our customers using existing platforms under our 21st Century warfare concept. Our integrated performance in Northern Edge did exactly that, and we are just getting started. 
Moving to some specific business area highlights. In Aeronautics, Switzerland's Federal Council announced its decision to purchase 36 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing, or CTOL aircraft, along with sustainment and training services as part of their Air 2030 modernization program. This is a significant win for Lockheed Martin with an initial value of $5.5 billion and a total value of approximately $15 billion over 30 years. The F-35 was selected over the F-18, the Ruffell and the Eurofighter because of its survivability information superiority and comprehensively network systems. The Swiss Council also noted that the F-35 delivered outstanding value, offering both the lowest procurement and operational costs across all those competing aircraft. Switzerland will become the 15th nation to join the program since its inception, and we're excited to welcome them into the F-35 community. 
In Rotary and Mission Systems, the U.S. Navy awarded our Sikorsky team a contract for 9 CH-53K heavy-look helicopters for production lot 5, which was worth nearly $900 million, and we're continuing to drive cost down and provide reduced unit prices to our customer. The award also included the option for 9 additional King Stallion aircraft for Lot 6, which when those are exercised, would represent over $1.9 billion in order for the Lot 5 and 6 combined. Including the previous Lot 5 award, we received orders for [ 33 53Ks ] out of a Navy program record of 200. So a long way to go. Over 80% of the domestic aircraft quantities are still in front of us. And interest from international customers is driving additional opportunities. 
Also in RMS, our C6 ISR team participated in a unique collaboration with the Air Force to integrate critical battle management capabilities from our Command and Control legacy product, the theater battle management control system, or TBMCS, into the Air Force's new Kessel Run all-domain operations suite. The TBMCS was first declared a system of record in 2000 and performs the planning and execution of air missions, interfacing with many other operations, intelligence and C2 systems throughout the U.S. armed services. Our RMS team delivered a cloud-based architecture and delivery plan to enhance capabilities and migrate TBMCS data into the Kessel Run operation suite in support of pilots and commanders executing joint air campaigns. So another example of our 21st Century Work Fare concept in action with our Air Force customer in this case. 
In Missiles and Fire Control, our integrated air and missile defense line of business delivered the first pack-free Missile Segment Enhancement, or MSE, interceptors to Sweden, providing a country with the world's most advanced air defense capabilities to defend against incoming threats. Sweden now becomes 1 of 10 international customers to choose PAC-3 MSE missiles. 
In addition, our Space business area successfully launched 2 new satellites in support of critical national security space objectives. Our food space-based infrared system and geosynchronous erithorbit or Sivers [ GO-V ] satellite successfully deployed from a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and is now communicating with the operations team from the U.S. space for us.  Sivers GO-V is the latest satellite to join the Space Force's orbiting early warning missile constellation, and it's equipped with powerful surveillance sensors to support ballistic missile defense and expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster situational awareness for the guardians that are defending the U.S. and its allies. 
The [ CivRuSGO5 ] satellite is the first military satellite built on an LM 2100 combat bus. That's a more resilient, modernized and modular space vehicle, originally developed using Lockheed Martin internal investment. 
Also, the fifth global positioning system, our GPS-III satellite, was also successfully launched this quarter. The GPS-III Space Vehicle 5 is the 31st operational GPS satellite in the Constellation with significant advancements over previous GPS-based vehicles, including 3x better accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities. The GPS-III and OPIR satellite constellations are both Lockheed Martin signature programs and represent key elements of our network-centric 21st Century Warfare concept. 
And lastly, our Space business area was selected by NASA to build spacecraft for 2 separate missions to Venus. Lockheed Martin will design, build and operate the Veritas orbiter to investigate the surface and subsurface of Venus and the Da Vinci Plus vehicle to research the planet's atmosphere. These missions build on our legacy Magellan program for the exploration of Venus and will represent NASA's first return to the planet in more than 3 decades. These achievements from across the company highlight our focus on providing innovative solutions and the strength that our broad portfolio gives us to support our customers' missions and their all domain objectives. 
I'll close my remarks today with a quick status on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced last December, a transaction that we believe will enhance Lockheed Martins as well as all of industry's ability to meet our future national security and civil space objectives when it comes to propulsion. We are committed to achieving the key DoD priorities of reducing cost, increasing the quality and speed of new products, in addition to enhancing Aerojet Rocketdyne's position as a leading merchant supplier to all of the industry. We remain in the process of responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request for information, which we received earlier in the year, a step in the review process that we had expected. We continue to engage with the FTC and Department of Defense stakeholders regularly as part of their review. And pending approval, we hope to -- and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw solid growth in sales and earnings per share. Segment operating profit was comparable to last year's second quarter total, due to the $225 million impact of a classified aeronautics program, while cash from operations was $1.3 billion, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, cash returned to shareholders exceeded 100% of free cash flow as we executed another $500 million of share repurchases in addition to $721 million of dividends paid. Despite the issue of a single contract, we are able to increase our outlook for earnings per share and hold our full year outlook for all other key financial metrics. 
Turning to Chart 4. We compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Second quarter sales grew 5% compared with 2020 to $17 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit remained at approximately $1.8 billion comparable to last year's results. 
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.52 was $0.73 above our results last year, driven by volume, reduced share count and higher FAS/CAS income. 
On Chart 6, we will look at our cash generation and distributions for the second quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was $950 million. By executing additional share repurchases of $500 million in the second quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to generate -- excuse me, we were able to return 129% of free cash flow to our stockholders this quarter. 
Moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for earnings per share and holding our outlook for sales, segment operating profit and cash from operations. 
Looking at Chart 8, we are increasing the sales outlook for RMS by $150 million, and that's primarily driven by volume at Sikorsky as well as a $25 million increase at our Space business area and combined, offset the downward adjustment at Aeronautics, keeping total sales consistent with our prior guidance. 
And on Chart 9, we show the increased segment operating profit range for RMS, Missiles and Fire Control and Space, also offsetting the impact realized at Aeronautics, which allowed us to hold our guidance for the year. And we will continue to pursue cost takeout and margin improvement opportunities across the corporation. 
On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our update to the guidance for 2021 earnings per share. Program performance and continued cost takeout offset our impact at Aeronautics, and we also saw improvements to earnings per share from investments and other nonoperational items, along with the benefit of our continued share repurchases. 
To conclude on Chart 11, we have our summary. We continue to see sales growth year-over-year as well as strong operational cash performance while still accelerating cash to our supply chain to meet commitments vital to our national security. And as noted, we have increased our full outlook for earnings per share and are holding all other key metrics as we look ahead to the second half of 2021. 
And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

And when I say defense enterprise, I mean government military and industry. It needs to change. And where I think I can address your question is during that period of change, and it's very important and critical that we started now, that Lockheed Martin is in a position with its breadth of platforms and systems and its cutting-edge technology to both drive and benefit from that needed change. And so yes, over the next 5 years, we're going to strive for mid-single-digit growth. And I'm energized and enthusiastic about working with our government military leaders, which we've already started and with our defense sector and telecom and technology sectors, partners that we're going to have in the future to do this. And I'm convinced that our shareholders are going to benefit from our leadership here. 
We're going to benefit in a couple of ways, and one of them is going to be by enhancing the value of our legacy programs, including the obvious F-35 is a much valuable -- more valuable platform when you take advantage of the network effect that it can deliver by connecting sensors across domains adding 5G.mil capability to our comm system so that we can communicate with satellites directly, et cetera, you end up getting a whole network effect with the value to the defense enterprise and the deterrent value is going to go up by implementing this across our technology road map over the next number of years, our existing systems. So I'm very energized about the growth prospect. I think we have a uniquely positioned capability to drive it, and that we've got a unique capability to interact with commercial industry in a whole number of sectors to help it happen."

So we're actually not expecting our 21st Century Warfare concept to get funded independently, rather, we're going to use that to make our current and future platforms way more competitive, way more attractive, use a network effect to get more value for money for the government and see how the budget can shift our way depending on -- in fact, irrespective of how much the top line grows. Let me ask Ken to follow up on that."

So if you think about our portfolio and where we are and where we're going, so F-35, rough numbers, 27%, 28% of our portfolio, and you think about where we are and where we're going with that program. So we're right now for production in the midst of our -- what's called the production rebaseline. And that's basically due to COVID and trying to get our technology Refresh 3 on Lot 15 and Block 4 onto Lot 16. The customer -- the joint program office is working with all the key constituents to look at what makes sense. 
As you recall, this year, we're going to deliver anywhere from 133 to 139 aircraft, what makes sense next year and the next couple of years to make sure we maximize when we put that key technology on that aircraft. So you're going to likely see once that gets revealed, and hopefully, it'll be -- we'll be able to reveal that with the customer when we give trend data in October. But it's likely to show the plateau of production slightly pushed out to the right, but also elongating, if you will. 
So I think at least in the next couple of years, there is likely some opportunity there from a production standpoint. There is definitely opportunity for us in sustainment. If you think about it, only roughly 40%, 50% of the bases are stood up. So we still have a lot of work to do there. We're also going to have many more aircraft in the fleet in the next couple of years. Think of it in the next couple of years, we're going to have over 1,000 aircraft in the fleet, which are going to require more sparing. That modernization I just talked about, working with the customer, we're also going to have to modernize some aircraft to put this new technology on aircraft that are already in the fleet. So that's 1 area. 
Sticking with Aeronautics, you have F-16, which is an international play. We have a backlog of 128 aircraft. That is going to continue to grow top line as well skunkworks. That's going to become a larger part of the Aeronautics platform. And just sticking internationally, we see strong demand for our integrated air missile defense products. If you look at our helicopter programs, we're just starting to deliver CH-53 aircraft program, a record of 200, plus the Israelis. Hopefully, there'll be a couple of other countries that have an interest in that platform. And then there's future vertical lift, which will give us a huge uplift in the middle of this decade going forward when we win those programs. 
And then there's Space. You mentioned hypersonics. That is going to be a nice complementary part of that portfolio. I agree. It's not going to dramatically move the needle, but you're going to have those programs go into production in the middle of this decade, which will give us some uplift. And then national security space, whether it's classified, OPIR, NGI, we'll see some strong growth there. So we feel pretty good -- complementing what Jim said, we feel pretty good about our prospects going forward."

And as I mentioned before, if you look at the large amount of cash that we have, our thought back then, and it still remains today, we continue to have that cash on our balance sheet. And we believe we're going to continue to have, that after Aerojet Rocketdyne, we're going to remain in the market. That was our thought process in April when we did the $500 million ASR. We're highly likely, based on where our stock price is trading today, we're going to enter the market again as soon as we're able to, may not be an ASR, but we're going to go into the open market and buy back more stock. It just absolutely makes sense to do that. 
Regarding when we knew about the charge. That basically happened in the May time period. It became clear based on from a process standpoint, Cai, we had a joint customer Lockheed Martin review to do a deep dive on the program. And then we also did 1, that was Lockheed Martin only, to provide an additional assurance function. So we've done a very thorough assessment of the situation, and that was done in the May time period. 
And in fact, in the June time period, we reported out to our Board. So Jim; myself; and Frank St. John, our COO, reported out to the Board. And we also had what's called a Classified Business and Security Committee meeting, and we actually owe them a comeback in September. So that all initiated in May. We're very comfortable with the charge. 
Just to give a little bit of a flavor of that $225 million, that is for the development portion of this program. Think of that as roughly 40% of that cost has already occurred. And the other 60% is embedded in the new estimate to complete. So we're not assuming that this program goes forward with the -- excuse me, the prior ETC. It is a new estimate to complete with that overrun embedded. So we think we have a good handle on that. And from a timing standpoint, it was after the ASR was put in place."

And hopefully, I've given you guys enough experience where I'll be as transparent as I can. But on this, there's only so much we could say. 
So as I answered Cai's question, Noah, we've done a lot of independent reviews. We've done reviews with the customer. We think today, based on all the information we have, it's a development contract that we believe will be successful from a schedule and performance standpoint and then ultimately will turn into production -- a production program. And we also believe there are additional opportunities out there. And I'll assure you, I could say is that there is still a very strong business case given these associated opportunities. So this will be a great program for our customers, and I'm talking about all the customers out there that are going to utilize this, and it will be a good program for the Lockheed Martin Corporation. 
Regarding Aeronautics, Noah, you've got it right. For the second half of the year, we're basically assuming a little bit over 11% return on sales. And think of that as it's got to be primarily F-35. It will be -- from that standpoint, we are assuming some risk retirements on some production programs. I have mentioned in the past on the block buy, we have taken a pause on risk retirements until we see improved performance there probably next year. But there are other lots out there. 
Back to the comments we made about our cost takeout initiatives, cost competitive niches and our strong performance in other parts of the portfolio, we believe F-35 production, there's other opportunities out there for us to have risk retirements. F-16, we'll also see some improvement as will C-130. So I think you got that right. Aeronautics, we feel comfortable being around 11% or a little bit above 11% return on sales for the second half of the year."

So Myles, we've done, for the first half of the year, a little over $3 billion, which would tell you we need to do $6.9 billion.

So Myles, we've done, for the first half of the year, a little over $3 billion, which would tell you we need to do $6.9 billion. And based on what I'm seeing the lion's share that I'm not giving you much comfort, but once I finish, I will, hopefully, the lion's share of that $6.9 billion is in the fourth quarter. 
And really, the driver there is we're in the midst -- and a lot of this is due to COVID. We're in the midst of renegotiating, if you will, the timing and the amount of performance-based payments on the F-35 program. That's specifically block buy. We're working through that now. And if you look at January 1 to the end of the second quarter, rough numbers, our contract assets grew by roughly $1.9 billion. The lion's share of that is F-35, and the lion's share of that is performance-based payments, timing, if you will, of when we liquidate that for F-35. 
We believe we're on a path with the customer to close on that. This is the third quarter, to close on that in the third quarter. And just to give you a little more color, we think working -- excuse me, we think contract assets are going to grow another $500 million in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter, and most of that will be before December. To give you some comfort, we'll be liquidating contract assets to the point where we only see contract assets growing in total by an immaterial amount. They'll come down quite a bit, and that's driven by the fourth quarter. And most of that is driven by Aeronautics. 
There is some work that needs to be done from a cash collection standpoint in RMS as well. But the lion's share of that is Aeronautics. And we feel really bullish, Myles, about the $8.9 billion of cash from [ also ] this year. 
In terms of backlog, I think we've already stated that -- so you've got Lot 15 that we thought -- for F-35 that we thought would settle last year. We believe it's now going to settle this year. There's just a lot of complications going on. And we think the joint program office working with all the constituents. It has a very difficult job, but they're doing a really great job of coordinating what the demands and the needs are of the services plus the international customers. We think that will close in the third quarter. But because of that, we have little to no comfort that Lot 16 is going to close this year. So we're actually out looking that to close next year. And that's a sizable order. It's just timing, which means right now, we're forecasting backlog to end this year at about $143 billion. So we're actually going to erode backlog this year. But as I -- again, I'll stress that's all timing. And for Lockheed Martin, we've gotten enough advanced funding on those lots for 15 and 16 where it's not an impact to us. It will just be optically a reduction in backlog."

We spent about $500 million to date in investments to improve the sustainability cost of F-35 there, Peter. And we'll continue to make investments as we go forward. But there's a perspective that I can give you from a former Air Force pilot because operationally and on the line where the pilots and the commanders are flying the jets and defending the country and doing the missions, there's actually a lot of good things happening, and they'll tell you this themselves. But first of all, you can go to the performance metrics mean flight hour between failure metric. When can you expect to fly the jet before you've got to get a spare airplane that day, it's nearly double the contractual requirement. And so the pilots, when they get an assignment of the tail number for a mission on any given day, they're twice as likely to get in that airplane and fly the mission as they are in any other fourth-gen plane. 
On top of that, it's about twice as reliable as a fourth-generation fighter. And meanwhile, the labor hours of maintenance needed for each of those flight hours is about 2/3 of the contractual requirements. So if you get out to basis and talk to commanders who have either in their wings, F-35s and other aircraft or they've commanded different squadrons of different types of aircraft, they'll tell you that for the frontline performance in the area of operations, if you will, the F-35 is sort of head and shoulders above legacy aircraft. 
In fact, the Air Force had about 18 months in CENTCOM recently where they just got back from that tour, if you will. They had 1,300 [ sorties ] with F-35, and the mission-capable rate was nearly 75%, sometimes 80% to 90% any given week. And that's really, really strong. I haven't been out and done this before. I can tell you, that's top shelf. 
Now on the other hand, the affordability we need to address, and I've met with each of the service chiefs and the Chairman to employ all of us to work together on this, Lockheed Martin, with that $500 million investment over the last few years has taken about 40% of the cost that we can control out of our purview, if you will, already. We're going to shoot for another 40% over the next 5 years, but somehow 40% keeps coming up. We're only about [ 40% ] of the total cost. So 60% is propulsion and military government cost. If we don't have an all-in strategy together to address this, we're not going to hit the goals. And so again, when I meet with the chiefs and the Chairman and hopefully soon with the service chiefs, we will all get together on a Tiger team and address this in the only way it can be successfully addressed as an integrated team. So that's how we're going to approach it. 
I do agree with the team at Aeronautics that there is a way to get this cost per flying hour on an A model of 25,000 an hour, but it's got to be an all-in approach. And we're going to keep doing our part, of course. But I'm personally involved in trying to pull the wider team together to get that done."

Rob, the 2 things are completely compatible. And my recent experience has been in the telecom and tech industry, where it was essential that open architecture be the baseline or the foundation, if you will, for 4 and 5G network development, telecom, for example. So our approach is completely based on open architecture. We even have a product we call open radio architecture that we demonstrated in a [ U2 ] Lockheed [ U2 ], of course, as basically a cell tower in the sky connecting F-35 and F-22 data lengths to, again, the open radio architecture. And we could add an F-18 or another aircraft, even an allied aircraft, a Eurofighter, for example, down the road. The whole point of this is you want to build the network effect as broadly as you can across, frankly, all the platforms out there eventually. But we're building a road map internally to Lockheed Martin because these are the products and platforms we can control to install trial, demonstrate and then produce these in our products. At the same time, like I said earlier, we're open to collaborating with our industry partners that are traditional in defense and aerospace and eagerly and already successfully with some of my old counterparts and my former counterparts, I should say, in telecom and tech where we're trying to build out the Internet of Things network of the future here. 
So this is something where you can and must have an open architecture. The vendor lock, so to speak, will diminish. But this is a matter of leadership and speed and performance, and that's where Lockheed Martin can, I think, take a great position going forward here."

So yes, generally speaking, our customers frown upon us from talking about the size of classified. But if you think about it, Aeronautics and Space would have the largest classified business in our portfolio; third would be Missiles and Fire Control; and then fourth, but last but not least, I'll stress is RMS. 
We see a lot of opportunities in Space, and that has not been something that's recent, but it seems to be trending up in an accelerated way and also in Aeronautics. We've talked about this unfortunate mischarge on this program that we have today. As I stressed when asked earlier, we do believe this thing has a very strong business case going forward, which will continue to grow. 
There's also other programs in the Aeronautics portfolio that will continue to grow. At Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the classified program we won that requires some capital, that is still in development. And in the not-too-distant future, that also will go into production. So we see the classified portion of Lockheed Martin growing faster than the nonclassified portion of Lockheed Martin. 
Regarding how we run classified versus nonclassified, that's a timely question. Because recall, when I answered the question about our classified business and Security Committee of our Board, that is one thing that we do go demonstrate to them that the processes that we have in the white world are identical to the processes that we try to put in the black world. And we also have the -- our internal audit organization is part of that, and we just reaffirmed that. And our external auditors, E&Y, are also instrumental and part of that. So the key is we try to mirror what we're doing in the nonclassified from a process standpoint into the classified world."

I don't know, maybe it's $90 million on average or something like that. But specifically for next year, how does the rebaselining affect your production revenue expectations?"

Thanks, Seth, and good morning to you. Yes. So we're still -- as I said earlier, we're still working through that rebaseline with the joint program office, who think of that as the quarterback, the program manager dealing with the services and the international customers. So the -- all I could say today is our base plan was [ at ] 169 aircraft. It is highly likely we are going to deliver less aircraft next year than 169. I just don't know what that is. 
And the only other thing I could say, and I don't mean to make this sound like Yogi Berra, but it's likely going to be less than what it would have been. I'm not suggesting it will be less than this year, but it will be less than the forecasted 169. And you're spot on, Seth. This rebaseline may take 2, 3 years. And again, that's something else we'll get from the customer. And the plateau will ultimately be 170 aircraft, perhaps a little bit more. And that plateau then will extend out farther out into the future than what we thought. 
And back to Jim's opening comments, we were just notified we won in Switzerland. That is a big, big deal for us. We just put in our best and final offer for Finland. We're in the hunt for the next-generation fighter aircraft in Canada. There are many other customers that have an interest in this aircraft, including this, of course, the services of the United States. So we think there is a strong demand out there for this aircraft. 
Now regarding price, regarding the B variant and the C variant, just based on quantities, it's likely you'll see the price of that aircraft either stay where it is or continue to come down the learning curve. The A variant, and I'm not trying to negotiate with the customer on the phone, but due to where we are in learning, due to where we are with inflation and due to where we are with the added capabilities that they want on the aircraft, it is likely you'll see an increase in prices, a modest increase in prices of where we are today. You got to factor all that in. We should have a better answer for you in the October time period in terms of what the impact is."

So on sustainment, think of sustainment, there's sustainment in F-35, which, back to the comments Jim made and that I made earlier, we still see strong demand. Of course, we want to get the cost per flight hour down. We also want to ensure that there's available aircraft out there, but the demand is going to grow there, and there is a keen desire for the more fielded aircraft that we have out there, the more robust sustainment program we have. 
We also have sustainment -- think of sustainment on F-22. I mean, eventually F-22s are going to get sunset. But I would say in the foreseeable future, think of F-22 sales not being quite, say, $1 billion -- they're over $1 billion. And going forward, you may see that decline just a little bit. 
F-16, a big portion of F-16 sustainment for international customers. And I believe we've mentioned this in the not-too-distant past. We actually got a contract with the United States Air Force to sustain their aircraft. And it's been quite a while since we've gotten a current contract for that. So I don't see that demand going away or the interest going either. C-130, a big piece of that is sustainment of aircraft internationally. And then in our skunk works, think of the U2 is a sustainment contract. And ultimately, they all get sunsetted as well, but not in the not-too-distant future. 
And your second question was on block by margins. Yes, it's right now, Joe, we're seeing -- we're taking a pause because what we agreed to in negotiations from a learning curve standpoint coming down the learning curve, we're still coming down the learning curve from a -- this is cost now, down the learning curve, not as robust as we planned to take these risk retirements. So we want to see continued performance into next year before we take those risk retirements at that time. And so think of block by margins are very high single-digit margins. These risk retirements would take them up into the low double-digit margins. But we'll likely keep pausing that until next year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'll begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on our financial results, which Ken will elaborate on in a few minutes.  
Our second quarter sales increased 5% over last year's second quarter, as each business area exceeded 2020 levels, led by our Space team. Our Space business grew over 10% this quarter due to growth in hypersonics; next-generation overhead persistent infrared, or OPIR, satellite activities; and increased support provided to the U.K. Ministry of Defense's Atomic Weapons Establishment program, which will close out our management of that activity.  
Our segment operating profit was impacted this quarter by a onetime charge associated with the classified program in our Aeronautics business area. While the classified nature of this program precludes us from discussing this matter in depth, we can say that our customer is highly attracted to the capabilities that we are developing on their behalf, that we're committed to delivering these capabilities and that the long-term potential of this solution is significant for the company.  
Our cash generation remains strong, driving $1.3 billion of cash from operations this quarter, after making $1.4 billion of accelerated payments to our supply base, as we continue to mitigate the risks brought on by COVID-19 for our supply chain. 
Our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet gave us the ability to complete a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter, in addition to the $1 billion ASR executed last quarter, thereby bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $1.5 billion. 
We remain confident in our ability to continue driving strong cash generation and supporting balanced cash deployment actions, including investing in key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to shareholders.  
Turning to budgets. The White House submitted their fiscal year 2022 budget proposal to Congress, requesting $715 billion for the Department of Defense, an $11 billion increase from the FY '21 enacted budget. Our programs continue to be well supported, including over $12 billion for the F-35 program; approximately $3.5 billion for our signature Sikorsky helicopters; and over $2 billion for hypersonics programs. 
The President's budget request prioritizes funding for innovation and modernization as well, in recognition of the need to invest in technologies and capabilities to address the great power competition the nation now faces. These include areas of strength within the Lockheed Martin portfolio such as continued support for air and missile defense programs; FAD PAC-3 and our recent next-generation interceptor award; space domain initiatives, including OPIR and GPS III satellites; and the Space Development Agency's transport layer architecture. 
The Defense Department request also focused on investments in advanced capability enablers. We believe this vision of deterrence and innovation is well aligned with our broad portfolio and our 21st Century Warfare vision.
In congressional March to date of the FY '22 defense budget request, we continue to see strong support from the Hill for all of our programs, which include increases for F-35, C-130, CH-53K and UH-60 programs, and fully approved budget requests for many of our other systems.  
Turning to some strategic and operational achievements from this quarter, I'd like to begin by highlighting the company's participation in Northern Edge 21, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command exercise in support of the Pacific deterrence initiative. This live exercise included multiple U.S. military services across a very wide geographic area with the goal of enhancing joint interoperability between the services and the various domains that they operate in. 
Signature programs from all 4 of our business areas participated in this event, and we successfully demonstrated Joint All Domain Command and Control, known as JADC2. We demonstrated capabilities such as enhanced situational awareness by integrating sensors across land, sea, air and space, for example.  
Among our successful demonstrations of JADC2 during the exercise was, one, enabling Aegis and PAC-3 MSE integration for integrated air and missile defense against advanced threats. Also using the F-35 to provide real-time tracking and targeting data generated near San Diego during a flight to the all-domain operations center in Alaska for prosecution and fire control; also facilitating space-based connectivity at the same time using the MUOS narrowband satellite communications constellation; and also supporting the Air National Guard demonstration of a new data link capability with our Legion Pod, which integrates our infrared search-and-track targeting sensor technology into that broader network.  
The Northern Edge exercise demonstrated our integrated offensive and defensive fires capability, our satellite communication links as well as the ability to adapt joint battle management concepts in real time. One of my goals in the first year as CEO of Lockheed Martin was to actually demonstrate the benefits of network effects to our customers using existing platforms under our 21st Century Warfare concept. Our integrated performance in Northern Edge did exactly that, and we are just getting started.  
Moving to some specific business area highlights. In Aeronautics, Switzerland's Federal Council announced its decision to purchase 36 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing, or CTOL aircraft, along with sustainment and training services as part of their Air2030 modernization program. This is a significant win for Lockheed Martin with an initial value of $5.5 billion and a total value of approximately $15 billion over 30 years. 
The F-35 was selected over the F-18, the Rafale and the Eurofighter because of its survivability, information superiority and comprehensively network systems. The Swiss Council also noted that the F-35 delivered outstanding value, offering both the lowest procurement and operational cost across all those competing aircraft. Switzerland will become the 15th nation to join the program since its inception, and we're excited to welcome them into the F-35 community.  
In Rotary and Mission Systems, the U.S. Navy awarded our Sikorsky team a contract for 9 CH-53K heavy-lift helicopters for production Lot 5, which was worth nearly $900 million, and we're continuing to drive cost down and provide reduced unit prices to our customer. 
The award also included the option for 9 additional King Stallion aircraft for Lot 6, which, when those are exercised, would represent over $1.9 billion in order for the Lot 5 and 6 combined. Including the previous Lot 5 award, we've received orders for 33 53Ks out of a Navy program record of 200, so a long way to go. Over 80% of the domestic aircraft quantities are still in front of us, and interest from international customers is driving additional opportunities.  
Also in RMS, our C6ISR team participated in a unique collaboration with the Air Force to integrate critical battle management capabilities from our Command & Control legacy product, the Theater Battle Management Control System, or TBMCS, into the Air Force's new Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite. 
The TBMCS was first declared a system of record in 2000 and performs the planning and execution of air missions, interfacing with many other operations, intelligence and C2 systems throughout the U.S. armed services. Our RMS team delivered a cloud-based architecture and delivery plan to enhance capabilities and migrate TBMCS data into the Kessel Run operation suite in support of pilots and commanders executing joint air campaigns. It's another example of our 21st Century Warfare concept in action with our Air Force customer in this case.  
In Missiles and Fire Control, our integrated air and missile defense line of business delivered the first PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement, or MSE, interceptors to Sweden, providing our country with the world's most advanced air defense capabilities to defend against incoming threats. Sweden now becomes 1 of 10 international customers to choose PAC-3 MSE missiles.  
In addition, our Space business area successfully launched 2 new satellites in support of critical national security space objectives. Our fifth Space Based Infrared System and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit, or SBIRS GEO-5 satellite, successfully deployed from its United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and is now communicating with the operations team from the U.S. Space Force.  
SBIRS GEO-5 is the latest satellite to join the Space Force's orbiting early warning missile constellation and is equipped with powerful surveillance sensors to support ballistic missile defense and expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster situational awareness for the guardians that are defending the U.S. and its allies. The SBIRS GEO-5 satellite is the first military satellite built on an LM 2100 Combat Bus. That's a more resilient, modernized and modular space vehicle originally developed using Lockheed Martin internal investment.
Also the fifth global positioning system, our GPS-III satellite, was also successfully launched this quarter. The GPS III Space Vehicle 05 is the 31st operational GPS satellite in the constellation with significant advancements over previous GPS-based vehicles, including 3x better accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities. The GPS-III and OPIR satellite constellations are both Lockheed Martin signature programs and represent key elements of our network-centric 21st Century Warfare concept.  
And lastly, our Space business area was selected by NASA to build spacecraft for 2 separate missions to Venus. Lockheed Martin will design, build and operate the VERITAS orbiter to investigate the surface and subsurface of Venus and the DAVINCI+ vehicle to research the planet's atmosphere. This mission is build on our legacy Magellan program for the exploration of Venus and will represent NASA's first return to the planet in more than 3 decades. 
These achievements from across the company highlight our focus on providing innovative solutions and the strength that our broad portfolio gives us to support our customers' missions and their all-domain objectives.  
I'll close my remarks today with a quick status on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced last December, a transaction that we believe will enhance Lockheed Martins as well as all of industry's ability to meet our future national security and civil space objectives when it comes to propulsion. 
We are committed to achieving the key DoD priorities of reducing cost, increasing the quality and speed of new products, in addition to enhancing Aerojet Rocketdyne's position as a leading merchant supplier to all of the industry. 
We remain in the process of responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request for information, which we received earlier in the year, a step in the review process that we had expected. We continue to engage with the FTC and Department of Defense stakeholders regularly as part of their review. And pending approval, we hope to -- and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

We saw solid",581,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today. 
Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw solid growth in sales and earnings per share. Segment operating profit was comparable to last year's second quarter total due to the $225 million impact of a classified aeronautics program, while cash from operations was $1.3 billion, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. 
For the second consecutive quarter, cash returned to shareholders exceeded 100% of free cash flow as we executed another $500 million of share repurchases, in addition to $721 million of dividends paid. 
Despite the issue of a single contract, we are able to increase our outlook for earnings per share and hold our full year outlook for all other key financial metrics.  
Turning to Chart 4. We compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Second quarter sales grew 5% compared with 2020 to $17 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit remained at approximately $1.8 billion comparable to last year's results.  
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.52 was $0.73 above our results last year driven by volume, reduced share count and higher FAS/CAS income.  
On Chart 6, we will look at our cash generation and distributions for the second quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was $950 million. By executing additional share repurchases of $500 million in the second quarter, as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to generate -- excuse me, we were able to return 129% of free cash flow to our stockholders this quarter.  
Moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for earnings per share and holding our outlook for sales, segment operating profit and cash from operations.  
Looking at Chart 8. We are increasing the sales outlook for RMS by $150 million, and that's primarily driven by volume at Sikorsky, as well as a $25 million increase at our Space business area and, combined, offset the downward adjustment at Aeronautics, keeping total sales consistent with our prior guidance.  
And on Chart 9, we show the increased segment operating profit range for RMS, Missiles and Fire Control and Space, also offsetting the impact realized at Aeronautics, which allowed us to hold our guidance for the year. And we will continue to pursue cost takeout and margin improvement opportunities across the corporation.  
On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our update to the guidance for 2021 earnings per share. Program performance and continued cost takeout offset our impact at Aeronautics, and we also saw improvements to earnings per share from investments and other nonoperational items, along with the benefit of our continued share repurchases. 
To conclude on Chart 11, we have our summary. We continue to see sales growth year-over-year as well as strong operational cash performance, while still accelerating cash to our supply chain to meet commitments vital to our national security. And as noted, we have increased our full outlook for earnings per share and are holding all other key metrics as we look ahead to the second half of 2021.

You talked some about the budget, but we're now in a fairly flat budget environment, and Lockheed Martin's revenues have moved higher, but the backlog has really not grown during the last 18 months, as some legacy programs have naturally flattened. 
You highlighted some good growth areas like hypersonics and space. But when you look at the next 5 years, do you believe you can get mid-single-digit, say, top line growth in this environment particularly given flat recent backlogs? I mean, basically, what should we look for that could take backlogs higher and drive enough growth to offset potential declines in mature programs?"

And when I say defense enterprise, I mean government military and industry. It needs to change. And where I think I can address your question is during that period of change, and it's very important and critical that we start it now, that Lockheed Martin is in a position with its breadth of platforms and systems and its cutting-edge technology to both drive and benefit from that needed change. 
And so, yes, over the next 5 years, we're going to strive for mid-single-digit growth. And I'm energized and enthusiastic about working with our government military leaders, which we've already started, and with our defense sector and telecom and technology sectors partners that we're going to have in the future to do this. And I'm convinced that our shareholders are going to benefit from our leadership here.  
We're going to benefit in a couple of ways, and one of them is going to be by enhancing the value of our legacy programs, including the obvious F-35 is a much valuable -- more valuable platform when you take advantage of the network effect that it can deliver by connecting sensors across domains, adding 5G.MIL capability to our comm system, so that we can communicate with satellites directly, et cetera, you end up getting a whole network effect with the value to the defense enterprise, and the deterrent value is going to go up by implementing this across our technology roadmap over the next number of years, our existing systems. 
So I'm very energized about the growth prospect. I think we have a uniquely positioned capability to drive it, and that we've got a unique capability to interact with commercial industry in a whole number of sectors to help it happen."

It's going to be a little bit more deliberate as far as the budget turns out. But within that budget, we intend to make our products platforms and services the leading edge and, therefore, the most attractive ways to allocate that budget in all the domains that we serve. 
So we're actually not expecting our 21st Century Warfare concept to get funded independently. Rather, we're going to use that to make our current and future platforms way more competitive, way more attractive, use a network effect to get more value for money for the government and see how the budget can shift our way depending on -- in fact, irrespective of how much the top line grows.

So if you think about our portfolio and where we are and where we're going, so F-35, rough numbers, 27%, 28% of our portfolio. And you think about where we are and where we're going with that program, so we're right now for production in the midst of our -- what's called a production rebaseline, and that's basically due to COVID and trying to get our Technology Refresh 3 on Lot 15 and Block 4 onto Lot 16. 
The customer -- the joint program office is working with all the key constituents to look at what makes sense. As you recall, this year, we're going to deliver anywhere from 133 to 139 aircraft. What makes sense next year and the next couple of years, to make sure we maximize when we put that key technology on that aircraft. 
So you're going to likely see, once that gets revealed, and hopefully, it'll be -- we'll be able to reveal that with the customer when we give trend data in October, but it's likely to show the plateau of production slightly pushed out to the right, but also elongating, if you will. 
So I think, at least in the next couple of years, there is likely some opportunity there from a production standpoint. There is definitely opportunity for us in sustainment. If you think about it, only roughly 40%, 50% of the bases are stood up, so we still have a lot of work to do there. 
We're also going to have many more aircraft in the fleet in the next couple of years. Think of it in the next couple of years, we're going to have over 1,000 aircraft in the fleet, which are going to require more sparing. That modernization I just talked about, working with the customer, we're also going to have to modernize some aircraft to put this new technology on aircraft that are already in the fleet. So that's one area. 
Sticking with Aeronautics, you have F-16, which is an international play. We have a backlog of 128 aircraft. That is going to continue to grow top line as well skunkworks. That's going to become a larger part of the Aeronautics platform. 
And just sticking internationally, we see strong demand for our integrated air missile defense products. If you look at our helicopter programs, we're just starting to deliver CH-53 aircraft program a record of 200. Plus the Israelis, hopefully, there'll be a couple of other countries that have an interest in that platform. And then there's future vertical lift, which will give us a huge uplift in the middle of this decade going forward when we win those programs. 
And then there's Space. You mentioned hypersonics. That is going to be a nice complementary part of that portfolio. I agree, it's not going to dramatically move the needle, but you're going to have those programs go into production in the middle of this decade, which will give us some uplift. 
And then national security space, whether it's classified, OPIR, NGI, we'll see some strong growth there. So we feel pretty good -- complementing what Jim said, we feel pretty good about our prospects going forward."

And as I mentioned before, if you look at the large amount of cash that we have, our thought back then, and it still remains today, we continue to have that cash on our balance sheet. And we believe we're going to continue to have that after Aerojet Rocketdyne. 
We're going to remain in the market. That was our thought process in April when we did the $500 million ASR. We're highly likely based on where our stock price is trading today. We're going to enter the market again as soon as we're able to. May not be an ASR, but we're going to go into the open market and buy back more stock. It just absolutely makes sense to do that. 
Regarding when we knew about the charge, that basically happened in the May time period. It became clear based on, from a process standpoint, Cai, we had a joint customer Lockheed Martin review to do a deep dive on the program. And then we also did one, that was Lockheed Martin only, to provide an additional assurance function. 
So we've done a very thorough assessment of the situation, and that was done in the May time period. And in fact, in the June time period, we reported out to our Board. So Jim, myself, and Frank St. John, our COO, reported out to the Board. And we also had what's called a Classified Business and Security Committee meeting, and we actually owe them a comeback in September. So that all initiated in May. 
We're very comfortable with the charge. So just to give a little bit of a flavor of that $225 million. That is for the development portion of this program. Think of that as roughly 40% of that cost has already occurred, and the other 60% is embedded in the new estimate to complete. 
So we're not assuming that this program goes forward with the -- excuse me, the prior ETC. It is a new estimate to complete with that overrun embedded. So we think we have a good handle on that. And from a timing standpoint, it was after the ASR was put in place."

So as I answered Cai's question, Noah, we've done a lot of independent reviews. We've done reviews with the customer. We think, today, based on all the information we have, it's a development contract that we believe will be successful from a schedule and performance standpoint and then ultimately will turn into a production program. 
And we also believe there are additional opportunities out there. And I'll assure you, we believe, I could say is that there is still a very strong business case given these associated opportunities. So this will be a great program for our customers, and I'm talking about all the customers out there that are going to utilize this, and it will be a good program for the Lockheed Martin Corporation. 
Regarding Aeronautics, Noah, you've got it right. For the second half of the year, we're basically assuming a little bit over 11% return on sales. And think of that as it's got to be primarily F-35. It will be -- from that standpoint, we are assuming some risk retirements on some production programs. I have mentioned in the past on the block buy, we have taken a pause on risk retirements until we see improved performance there probably next year. But there are other lots out there. 
Back to the comments we made about our cost takeout initiatives, cost competitive niches and our strong performance in other parts of the portfolio, we believe F-35 production, there's other opportunities out there for us to have risk retirements. 
F-16, we'll also see some improvement as will C-130. So I think you got that right. Aeronautics, we feel comfortable being around 11% or a little bit above 11% return on sales for the second half of the year."

And based on what I'm seeing, the lion's share of that, I'm not giving you much comfort. But once I finish, I will, hopefully. The lion's share of that $6.9 billion is in the fourth quarter. 
And really, the driver there is we're in the midst -- and a lot of this is due to COVID. We're in the midst of renegotiating, if you will, the timing and the amount of performance-based payments on the F-35 program. That's specifically block buy. We're working through that now. 
And if you look at January 1 to the end of the second quarter, rough numbers, our contract assets grew by roughly $1.9 billion. The lion's share of that is F-35, and the lion's share of that is performance-based payments timing, if you will, of when we liquidate that for F-35. 
We believe we're on a path with the customer to close on that -- this is the third quarter, to close on that in the third quarter. And just to give you a little more color, we think working -- excuse me, we think contract assets are going to grow another $500 million in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter, and most of that will be before December. 
To give you some comfort, we'll be liquidating contract assets to the point where we only see contract assets growing in total by an immaterial amount. They'll come down quite a bit, and that's driven by the fourth quarter. And most of that is driven by Aeronautics. 
There is some work that needs to be done from a cash collection standpoint at RMS as well, but the lion's share of that is Aeronautics. And we feel really bullish, Myles, about the $8.9 billion of cash also this year. 
In terms of backlog, I think we've already stated that -- so you've got Lot 15 that we thought -- for F-35 that we thought would settle last year. We believe it's now going to settle this year. There's just a lot of complications going on, and we think the joint program office working with all the constituents, it has a very difficult job, but they're doing a really great job of coordinating what the demands and the needs are of the services, plus the international customers. 
We think that will close in the third quarter. But because of that, we have little to no comfort that Lot 16 is going to close this year. So we're actually out looking that to close next year, and that's a sizable order. 
It's just timing, which means, right now, we're forecasting backlog to end this year at about $143 billion. So we're actually going to erode backlog this year. But as I -- again, I'll stress that's all timing. And for Lockheed Martin, we've gotten enough advanced funding on those lots for 15 and 16 where it's not an impact to us. It will just be optically a reduction in backlog."

We spent about $500 million to date in investments to improve the sustainability cost of F-35 there, Peter, and we'll continue to make reasonable investments as we go forward. 
But there's a perspective that I can give you from a former Air Force pilot because operationally and on the line where the pilots and the commanders are flying the jets and defending the country and doing the missions, there's actually a lot of good things happening, and they'll tell you this themselves. 
But first of all, you can go to the performance metrics, meaning that flight hour between failure metric, when can you expect to fly the jet before you've got to get a spare airplane that day. It's nearly double the contractual requirement. And so the pilots, when they get an assignment, the detail number for a mission on any given day, they're twice as likely to get in that airplane and fly the mission as they are in any other fourth-gen plane. 
On top of that, it's about twice as reliable as a fourth-generation fighter. And meanwhile, the labor hours of maintenance needed for each of those flight hours is about 2/3 of the contractual requirements. So if you get out to bases and talk to commanders who have either in their wings, F-35s and other aircraft or they've commanded different squadrons of different types of aircraft, they'll tell you that for the frontline performance in the area of operations, if you will, the F-35 is sort of head and shoulders above the legacy aircraft. 
In fact, the Air Force had about 18 months in CENTCOM recently where they just got back from that tour, if you will. They had 1,300 sorties with F-35, and the mission-capable rate was nearly 75%, sometimes 80% to 90% any given week. And that's really, really strong. I haven't been out and done this before. I can tell you that's top shelf. 
Now on the other hand, the affordability we need to address, and I've met with each of the Service Chiefs and the Chairman to employ all of us to work together on this. Lockheed Martin, with that $500 million investment over the last few years, has taken about 40% of the cost that we can control out of our purview, if you will, already. 
We're going to shoot for another 40% over the next 5 years. But somehow, 40% keeps coming up. We're only about [ 40% ] of the total cost. So 60% is propulsion and military government cost. 
If we don't have an all-in strategy together to address this, we're not going to hit the goals. And so, again, when I meet with the Chiefs and the Chairman and hopefully soon with the Service Chiefs, we will all get together on a tiger team and address this in the only way it can be successfully addressed as an integrated team. So that's how we're going to approach it. 
I do agree with the team at Aeronautics that there is a way to get this cost per flying hour on an A model of 25,000 an hour, but it's got to be an all-in approach. And we're going to keep doing our part, of course. But I'm personally involved in trying to pull the wider team together to get that done."

And we do think we have Pratt & Whitney from a propulsion standpoint, and the service is fully engaged now. And we believe we're going to soon be responding to an RFP. They're going to take a lot of the key pieces out of our white paper for us then to, what I'll call, answer a conventional request for proposal.

And I'll just remind you that this is likely not going to be a top line enhancement play for us. That's probably all embedded. But assuming the industry is incentivized to hit these targets or to overachieve these targets, it could potentially be a return on sales play for us."

The DoD say that F-35 is not going to be a bill payer of NGAD, and I still think that's still the answer out there, which is good news for the -- our great fifth-gen aircraft. But unfortunately, everything else regarding NGAD is classified, and we can't discuss what our role or not our role is. 
Regarding the amortization of R&D, we're still working with a lot of our constituents. When we come out with trend data in October, David, our tax experts are telling us, unfortunately, at that time, it's likely not to be settled. So it is likely we will offer trend data for '22. 
That would -- right now, what we see is, assuming this issue goes away or gets deferred and does not impact '22 cash, we see $9 billion or greater of cash from operations next year. So we're in the midst of going through our long-range plan. So hopefully, we'll be able to reaffirm that. 
But we're also then also going to have to state that, right now, what we see is this amortization issue was a $2.1 billion impact to cash in '22. We're hopeful that this thing either gets deferred out 5 years. That's one scenario we're hearing. I mean, we'll see where it goes or it gets repealed or it is interpreted differently than the way we, industry, are interpreting. And it really is just, what I'll call, conventional independent research and development for us, which would be, rough numbers, a $300 million impact rather than the $2.1 billion impact. 
But regardless, Lockheed Martin sees a path forward for us to continue generating strong cash this year and into the next couple of years. And we'll use that for our internal and organic, inorganic investments for our employees and then give a fair amount back to our shareholders."

Rob, the 2 things are completely compatible. And my recent experience has been in the telecom and tech industry, where it was essential that open architecture be the baseline or the foundation, if you will, for 4 and 5G network development in telecom, for example. 
So our approach is completely based on open architecture. We even have a product we call open radio architecture that we demonstrated in a U-2,  Lockheed U-2, of course, as basically a cell tower in the sky connecting F-35 and F-22 data links to, again, the open radio architecture. And we could add an F-18 or another aircraft, even an allied aircraft, a Eurofighter, for example, down the road. 
The whole point of this is you want to build the network effect as broadly as you can across, frankly, all the platforms out there eventually. But we're building a roadmap internally to Lockheed Martin because these are the products and platforms we can control to install, trial, demonstrate and then produce these in our products. 
At the same time, like I said earlier, we're open to collaborating with our industry partners that are traditional in defense and aerospace and eagerly and already successfully with some of my old counterparts and -- my former counterparts, I should say, in telecom and tech where we're trying to build out the Internet of Things network of the future here. 
So this is something where you can and must have an open architecture. The vendor lock, so to speak, will diminish. But this is a matter of leadership and speed and performance, and that's where Lockheed Martin can, I think, take a great position going forward here."

But if you think about it, Aeronautics and Space would have the largest classified business in our portfolio. Third would be Missiles and Fire Control. And then fourth, but last but not least, I'll stress is RMS. 
We see a lot of opportunities in Space, and that has not been something that's recent, but it seems to be trending up in an accelerated way. And also in Aeronautics, we've talked about this unfortunate mischarge on this program that we have today. As I stressed when asked earlier, we do believe this thing has a very strong business case going forward, which will continue to grow. There's also other programs in the Aeronautics portfolio that will continue to grow. 
At Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the classified program we won that requires some capital. That is still in development. And in the not-too-distant future, that also will go into production. So we see the classified portion of Lockheed Martin growing faster than the nonclassified portion of Lockheed Martin. 
Regarding how we run classified versus nonclassified, that's a timely question because, recall, when I answered the question about our classified business and Security Committee of our Board, that is one thing that we do go demonstrate to them that the processes that we have in the white world are identical to the processes that we try to put in the black world. 
And we also have the -- our internal audit organization is part of that, and we just reaffirmed that. And our external auditors, E&Y, are also instrumental and part of that. So the key is we try to mirror what we're doing in the nonclassified from a process standpoint into the classified world."

So we're still -- as I said earlier, we're still working through that rebaseline with the joint program office, who think of that as the quarterback, the program manager dealing with the services and the international customers. So the -- all I could say today is our base plan was 169 aircraft. It is highly likely we are going to deliver less aircraft next year than 169. I just don't know what that is. 
And the only other thing I could say, and I don't mean to make this sound like Yogi Berra, but it's likely going to be less than what it would have been. I'm not suggesting it will be less than this year, but it will be less than the forecasted 169. 
And you're spot on, Seth. This rebaseline may take 2, 3 years. And again, that's something else we'll get from the customer. And the plateau will ultimately be 170 aircraft, perhaps a little bit more, and that plateau then will extend out farther out into the future than what we thought. 
And back to Jim's opening comments, we were just notified we won in Switzerland. That is a big, big deal for us. We just put in our best and final offer in -- for Finland. We're in the hunt for the next-generation fighter aircraft in Canada. There are many other customers that have an interest in this aircraft, including this -- of course, the services of the United States. So we think there is a strong demand out there for this aircraft. 
Now regarding price, regarding the B variant and the C variant, just based on quantities, it's likely you'll see the price of that aircraft either stay where it is or continue to come down the learning curve. The A variant, and I'm not trying to negotiate with the customer on the phone, but due to where we are in learning, due to where we are with inflation and due to where we are with the added capabilities that they want on the aircraft, it is likely you'll see an increase in prices -- a modest increase in prices of where we are today. You've got to factor all that in. We should have a better answer for you in the October time period in terms of what the impact is."

Of course, we want to get the cost per flight hour down. We also want to ensure that there's available aircraft out there. But the demand is going to grow there, and there is a keen desire for the more fielded aircraft that we have out there, the more robust sustainment program we have. 
We also have sustainment, think of sustainment on F-22. I mean, eventually F-22s are going to get sunset. But I would say, in the foreseeable future, think of F-22 sales not being quite, say, $1 billion -- they're over $1 billion. And going forward, you may see that decline just a little bit. 
F-16, a big portion of F-16 sustainment for international customers, and I believe we've mentioned this in the not-too-distant past. We actually got a contract with the United States Air Force to sustain their aircraft. And it's been quite a while since we've gotten a current contract for that. So I don't see that demand going away or the interest going either. 
C-130, a big piece of that is sustainment of aircraft internationally. And then in our skunk works, think of the U-2 is a sustainment contract. And ultimately, they all get sunsetted as well, but not in the not-too-distant future. 
And your second question was on block buy margins. Yes, it's, right now, Joe, we're seeing -- we're taking a pause because what we agreed to in negotiations from a learning curve standpoint, coming down the learning curve, we're still coming down the learning curve from a -- this is cost now down the learning curve, not as robust as we planned to take these risk retirements. 
So we want to see continued performance into next year before we take those risk retirements at that time. And so think of block buy margins are very high single-digit margins. These risk retirements would take them up into the low double-digit margins, but we'll likely keep pausing that until next year."

In a few moments, John will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But",1275,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. In a few moments, John will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But first, I will provide a 5-year sales outlook and discuss our plans for accelerating capabilities to our customers and driving per share value to our shareholders over that time horizon. 
Last month, I led our executive leadership team as we completed our annual strategic and financial planning process. Given the scope of changes in our operating environment over the past year, we conducted a more in-depth and extended assessment of our financial forecast. Based on these strategic and financial reviews and the information available to us today, our current expectation is that sales in 2022 will decline slightly from our expected 2021 sales level. 
We then anticipate sales will increase slightly in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. This sales trajectory reflects a number of factors, including the continuing effects of the ongoing COVID pandemic and extended delivery time lines across our supply chain, moderating growth rates in the U.S. defense budget, shifts in customer priorities driven by recent events such as the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and the renationalization of the AWE program in the U.K. and our recently completed agreement with the F-35 joint program office on a rebaselining of aircraft deliveries under our production program. I'll address this significant agreement a little later in my remarks. 
As with all forward projections, our performance on current programs, our ability to win highly competitive new starts, the size of future defense budgets and the global geopolitical landscape will all influence our ultimate growth rate over the coming 5 years. But as we look ahead, there are 4 primary areas that underpin our longer-term growth forecast. The first of these future growth areas is within our hypersonics portfolio. 
We are currently performing on 6 hypersonic programs across the company and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity, multiple programs are expected to enter production between 2023 and 2026. The second growth area is within our classified activity. 3 of our 4 business areas are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs, we expect to begin the transition from development to production again between 23 and 26. 
The third area of expected growth lies in our current programs of record. Our portfolio is very well aligned with our customers' mission requirements. And as a result, we have multiple programs from each business area entering growth stages. This includes the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, F-35 sustainment activity, increased PAC-3 production rates and the modernization and enhancements to the fleet ballistic missile. 
And finally, we're in competition for several significant new business awards, including the future vertical lift, Florida and [indiscernible] competitions, the next-generation interceptor program, and the KC Tanker program. These represent meaningful opportunities to accelerate our projected top line growth profile with new long-term projects that are critical to our national defense. 
Now I'd like to discuss our strategy for driving strong returns for our shareholders in the near term while remaining well positioned for our expected return to growth in 2023. The central tenet of our value creation strategy is using a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. We will first reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers' requirements and drive organic growth. 
Concurrently, we will continue pursuing actionable inorganic growth opportunities that strengthen our core business. And we will return cash to shareholders through increasing dividend payments and a significantly expanded share repurchase program. 
To drive sustainable organic growth, we will continue making significant investments in our business area. These investments include nearly $2 billion of annual capital expenditures and approximately $1.5 billion in independent research and development spending each year. These investments are being made in our signature platforms and systems to provide our customers with the high-value solutions they're going to need to execute their missions of deterring if necessary, to feeding the pacing threats across all the domains of operations. 
Additionally, we are transforming our internal operations with a model-based engineering and enterprise architecture and we are building digital factories of the future. These investments in state-of-the-art engineering, manufacturing and sustainment tools and techniques will ensure our business areas can continue delivering outstanding performance levels on current programs while also positioning us to prevail in upcoming campaigns. 
After making these significant investments in our business to support our customers and drive organic growth, we expect to have substantial free cash flows available to return to you to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last month, the Board increased our quarterly dividend by $0.20 or approximately 8% to $2.80 per share and now $11.20 per share annually, providing shareholders, especially our yield investors with strong returns. This action marks the 20th consecutive year that the board has increased Lockheed Martin's quarterly dividend. 
Along with making an increased quarterly dividend payment, we will also provide additional value to shareholders by returning excess cash to them through a greatly expanded share repurchase program. As discussed in today's press release, we've already repurchased $2 billion of our shares through the first 3 quarters of 2021. 
And last month, on my recommendation, the Board increased our remaining share repurchase authority by $5 billion, bringing our current total share repurchase authority to approximately $6 billion. With our stock trading at the level well below what we calculate as the company's intrinsic value, we have significantly increased our planned share buybacks, and I anticipate that we will repurchase up to $6 billion of our shares over the next 12 to 18 months if conditions warrant. 
As a final note on shareholder value, we are going to dynamically allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, prioritizing investments that lead to growing free cash flow per share. That's our new metric. We will remain opportunistic in pursuing accretive bolt-on acquisitions, evaluate additional increases to our current share repurchase authorization and continue to reinvest capital into our business to drive long-term growth. 
We have the balance sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue multiple avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders. We built this balance sheet to use it, and we will do so, consistent with our focus on long-term shareholder value creation. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the capability to close on the Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction, provide robust returns to shareholders and continue to invest in our portfolio to support our customers and drive future growth. 
The Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction continues moving through the regulatory approval process and we now anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to highlight the efforts of the entire F-35 organization, including the government's joint program office, our team mason suppliers, our aeronautics organization and our international partners for establishing a new aircraft production baseline and delivery profile that will provide industry, government, partner countries and FMS customers as well as you, the investor community with important visibility well into the future. 
The program is strong and stable, and we have opportunities ahead of us to add to that strength. The program has delivered over 700 production aircraft out of a plan of record of over 3,300 jets, including to all 3 U.S. services and 9 international customers so far, and we look forward to continuing the successful program for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to John and I'll rejoin you to answer your questions."

Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of third quarter activity. Starting with sales, we reported revenue of $16 billion. This result was below our expectation as we realized larger-than-anticipated supply chain impacts across Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and Space. These impacts span multiple suppliers, and our expectation is that we will incrementally recover from these disruptions over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Despite this reduction in sales volume, our segment operating profit increased year-over-year to $1.9 billion on strong operational performance across the enterprise. Our earnings per share of $2.21 included a noncash charge of $4.72 related to our previously announced pension transaction. We generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations and continued our practice of accelerating payments to our supply chain with $1.5 billion in accelerated payments at quarter end. 
The supply chain disruptions we experienced during the third quarter underscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic. In addition, we continue to return substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchase activity. And we have provided trending data for 2022, which we will discuss further in a few minutes. 
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. As we noted in our earnings release, our third quarter sales are below 2020 levels, primarily because of the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program in our space business area. Our third quarter sales also reflect recent supply chain delays, most notably on the F-35 production activity and on several production programs within both Missiles and Fire Control and Space. 
Despite this reduction in sales volume, our third quarter segment operating profit is up from last year as strong operational performance resulted in significant risk retirements across all 4 business areas. 
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the quarter. Our earnings per share of $2.21 incorporates a $4.72 in noncash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer we completed back in August. On an adjusted basis, our pre-transaction earnings per share of $6.93 and was 11% higher than our 2020 results due to improved segment operating margins, reduced share count and another quarter of mark-to-market gains across our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio. 
While future volatility associated with investments in early-stage companies as expected, the significant gains realized across multiple holdings in our ventures portfolio, reinforce the value of investing in and partnering with companies focused on cutting-edge technologies. 
On Chart 6, we will look at our year-to-date cash generation and deployment. Subtracting our capital expenditures from almost $5 billion of cash from operations, our year-to-date free cash flow is greater than $4 billion. We've repurchased $2 billion of shares year-to-date, including $500 million during the third quarter and have made more than $2 billion in dividend payments. In total, our balanced cash deployment of nearly $4.2 billion represents over 100% of free cash flow returned to our shareholders year-to-date. And we will continue these shareholder-friendly actions going forward as evidenced by our recent dividend increase and share repurchase program announcements. 
Moving on to Chart 7 and our 2021 guidance update. We've lowered our 2021 outlook for sales and segment operating profit to reflect the previously discussed supply chain impacts that emerged in August and September. We've reduced our outlook for cash from operations primarily to reflect our updated plan to maintain our current $1.5 billion level of accelerated payments to our supply chain. We plan to continue supporting our suppliers as they recover from pandemic-related impacts, especially small and medium businesses, both across the country and internationally, to help maintain program schedules and customer missions. 
The full year outlook for earnings per share has increased $0.35 from the midpoint of last quarter's range driven by Lockheed Martin Ventures investment gains in several nonoperational items. Now turning to Chart 8. We take a closer look at the current year revisions to 2021 sales by business area. As discussed, Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and Space have all been affected by lower-than-anticipated activity coming through our supply chain. The level of reduction in supply chain activity over the past 2 months is higher than what we've been experiencing since the beginning of the pandemic, and our 2021 sales outlook assumes that we will see a return to more normal activity levels in the fourth quarter. In addition, our sales outlook for 2021 and our trending information for 2022 excludes any potential impacts associated with the recent executive order on safety protocols for federal contractors. 
On Chart 9, we see segment operating profit tracking with the reduction in expected sales volume our expected segment operating margin outlook remains at 11%. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our initial trending information for 2022. We've estimated 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion, a decline of 1.5% from our projected 2021 results. As a reminder, the renationalization of our work in support of the United Kingdom's Atomic Weapons Establishment earlier this year creates a headwind of just under $900 million on a year-over-year basis. 
We are expecting segment operating margins to remain at approximately 11%, and we are projecting growth in cash from operations year-over-year to greater than or equal to $8.4 billion. This outlook assumes there will be no increase in tax payments related to capitalizing R&D costs. If current legislation is not amended, our cash from operations outlook could be reduced by up to $2 billion. 
Also, given we continue experiencing impacts across our supply chain, we now anticipate maintaining accelerated payments at the current $1.5 billion level through year-end 2022. Our prior multiyear cash forecast assume there would no longer be a need to accelerate payments to our supply chain beyond 2021. We are currently assuming a statutory corporate tax rate of 21% and we have not included any financial projections associated with closing the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, which, as Jim mentioned, is now expected to occur during the first quarter of 2022, subject to required regulatory approval. 
Turning to pension-related assumptions. Interest rates have increased since year-end 2020. Our year-to-date actual returns have been higher than previously expected and we've lowered our long-term rate of return to 6.5%. And in response to investors asking for additional information on pension trends, we have included 2 charts on this topic in the appendix. These trends include no required pension contributions through 2025 based on current assumptions. 
On Chart 11, we outlined our expected capital deployment activities for 2022. We anticipate spending approximately $2 billion on capital projects next year, which represents an increase of approximately $300 million over expected 2021 levels. In addition, we anticipate investing approximately $1.5 billion on independent research and development activities, which represents a $200 million increase over planned 2021 levels. These investments are being made to enhance our delivery of critical systems and products to our customers as they execute their national security missions while ensuring we are well positioned to compete for new business opportunities. 
We will be making over $3 billion in dividend payments next year based on a recently announced $0.20 per share increase to our quarterly dividend rate. And as Jim shared earlier, we will also continue to strategically buy back shares when we believe they are trading below intrinsic value as they are now. We are planning to opportunistically repurchase up to $6 billion in shares over the next 12 to 18 months. 
We are confident we have the balance sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue all avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders. On Chart 12, we provide some additional detail on our expected long-term trajectory for F-35 sales. As Jim commented earlier, we recently reached agreement with the joint program office on our expected F-35 delivery plan. This joint plan represents the best intersection of production operations and supply chain capabilities, technology insertion in support of increasing mission requirements and both the timing and quantity of anticipated new production aircraft award decisions. We are very pleased with the outcome of this joint production replan as it provides stability and predictability across all key elements of this program. 
Deliveries are expected to grow to 156 aircraft by 2023 and will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. We are projecting F-35 production sales in 2022 will be lower than 2021 levels and sales will also decline slightly in 2023. Revenues are expected to remain around 2023 levels throughout the balance of the forecasted time frame. As we've previously discussed, the growth in F-35 sales volume will primarily be driven by sustainment activity as the number of deployed aircraft and associated flight hours grows rapidly while we continue to aggressively pursue cost takeout in partnership with our customer. 
Finally, we are also projecting modest growth in development activity as our customers continue seeking further advancements and capabilities for our unrivaled fifth-generation aircraft. To conclude, on Chart 14, we have our summary. We've reduced our 2021 outlook based on the higher-than-expected supply chain impacts we experienced during the third quarter. The supply chain and related production impacts, along with our updated F-35 production plan and the other factors Jim mentioned, have shaped our outlook for 2022 and our future expectations. Our strong balance sheet and cash generation give us multiple options to deploy cash. And to echo Jim, we will prioritize investments, which will grow free cash flow per share. And with our broad portfolio dedicated employees, strong balance sheet and a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy, we remain focused on our customers' mission and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

Or is it just too late for fiscal '22 funding to have an impact? 
And the second part to my question is, so you lowered your cash from operations guide for '22. I want to know if you could discuss a bit more about what you think cash flow looks like beyond '22 and what you're assuming along with that."

I'll take both parts of that 2-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budgetary based on, we're using the President's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trendin",483,"Yes. Thanks, Rich. It's John. I'll take both parts of that 2-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budgetary based on, we're using the President's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trending information we've given you. I'd say we're encouraged about the direction of the various committee markups as they reflect really good support for a number of our programs. And to your question about how much -- if any of this will come through in 2022, the answer to that question is going to be based on how much incremental funding is actually appropriated how long it takes for that appropriated funding to end up getting on contract with us and us flowing that down to our supply chain. And then the third factor is what specific programs the incremental appropriations are applied to. It's easier, obviously, to maintain programs at current run rates than it is to accelerate program. So any programs that we're planning sort of a trend down would be really good candidates for being able to see opportunities in 2022 related to increased appropriations. And I'll kind of finish this section by saying obviously, by the time we're in January, when we've given you an updated outlook for 2022, we should have a lot more clarity in and around the budgetary trends. 
Now turning to your -- the second part, which I had to do with -- we've previously given multiyear cash -- operating cash flow guidance. And of course, all these metrics are going to be assuming the R&D tax change does not go into effect. Our prior guidance was like 8, 9, 9 and 9, 1. You've seen we've got our guidance now at 8 3  for this year and 8 4 for next year. And I'll say we anticipate higher than 8 4 operating cash flow guidance as we look ahead to 2023. But really, the only factor that's changed since the multiyear guidance we gave before, is in the level and the duration of the accelerated payments we're planning to make to our supply chain. I think I mentioned in the script, we have previously in that [ $899.1 ] million track, assume we would be accelerating $1.2 billion worth of accelerated -- of payments to the supply chain at year-end at the end of this year. But then the assumption was the pandemic would be behind us in 2022. We'd unwind that program. We'd end 2022 with no accelerated payments being made through our supply chain. Our current forecast, the 8 3 and 8 4 assumes $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of this year and $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of 2022. So if the pandemic impacts are behind us before we end year-end 2022, our guide of 8.4% would increase by that $1.5 billion."

So Rob, I mean just to kind of foot stop what Jim was saying to give a little color. The 4 categories that Jim mentioned in his scripted remarks, hypersonics classified growth and programs of record and competitive new starts. When I look at that subset of revenue for those 4 categories in 2021 is sort of in the neighborhood of $17 billion. Over the period going out through -- for the next 5 years, that set of activity, assuming we hit our operational marks, assuming these these programs continue on their programs of record, and we win our share of these competitive new business opportunities that we've talked about. That $17 billion worth of program revenue today will grow at about a 9% compound annual growth rate, which gives me some level of comfort that the longer-term trends that Jim has talked about will hold. Just to reiterate, we're expecting a slight decline in '22, a bounce back in 2023. And then I would say, increasing growth and increasing growth rates going forward. Now -- yes, on the topic of margins, I think 11% is a good working target for us given the evolution in our portfolio and the activity that we see going forward. I just highlighted the 4 categories that we'll be seeing growth. A lot of those are new start programs. There is going to be some growth in programs of record, which we would hope to turn into accretive margin programs. But there is a lot of growth in new start areas, developmental areas. The good news is we will get -- there will be cost reimbursable contracts. We'll have assurance of recovery of the costs we're incurring, but they, by definition, will be lower margin activities moving forward. And I should mention, and this is just to get this on the record early, there are certain classified activities that we can't talk about. But if those programs continue to progress along the track that they're on. My expectation is we will be making investments in some of those programs out in the '23, '24, '25 time frame that will be dilutive to margins. But I think in balance, an 11% operating margin is a good metric for us."

I'll take and I'll talk thematically first through the 4 buckets and growth over time. And then maybe now as good as Tom as any to talk specifically about sort of what we're seeing moving from '21 to '22 and the headwinds. But the 4 big buckets, the first one is hypersonic activity. Today, we're doing about $1.5 billion worth of revenue in that area. If we are able to move a number of those activities into a -- from development into production, which we fully expect will happen. We're making great progress on a number of them that are visible and are being reported on today. But our projection would be assuming a number of those activities proceed into a production environment that $5 billion to grow as high as $3 billion by 2026. The second area classified in -- I'll say upfront, we hesitated even highlighting this given there's not a lot that we can say in general about classified activity. But because it is a large and growing component of our business. We thought it was important to at least give you a top-level trend information. And because like I said, we will be making investments in some of this activity downstream, which will have dilutive impacts thought it was a good idea to talk about. But in aggregate, our classified portfolio will grow, we expect at a rate above 5%. So that is a strong growing area for us. The programs of record, which, as Jim took through some of the big ones you mentioned would be CH-53K, F-35 sustainment the PAC-3 program and an additional growth in the fleet ballistic missile and evolutions and new advances in that program. That portfolio today is worth about $8.5 billion. When we project out to 2026, over that period of time, the compound annual growth rate in that program set is like and it's highlighted by CH-53K, where we will be delivering out to a program of record of 200 units. I think the final deliveries are made in 2032. But just keeping that program on its program of record will go a long way towards us achieving that growth in the program of record CAGR that I just talked about. And then the final area is the new business which are a set of sort of wildcards, you're going to get binary decisions in and around the [indiscernible] competition or the [indiscernible] competition. One of the new business areas that Jim talked about is next-generation interceptor. We've successfully moved into a down select where there's ourselves and one other competitor. We're making great progress. We've achieved a number of important program milestones recently. We feel good about where we're heading. But that will be a down select and then sort of the wildcard in the bunch and opportunity we're very excited about is the KCI tanker program, where we've announced that we will be teaming with Airbus, who we think has a very capable frame for doing this mission. I think we bring extensive experience in the mission capabilities that would go on to that airframe. I think we make a very formidable team. We're very excited about that opportunity and depending on outcomes, I mean, obviously, as we're doing next enough in either any of those programs besides the next-generation interceptor, that growth rate could be explosive. If we prevail on FLRAA and FARA, which we think we're very well positioned to do, if we're down selected on NGI and tanker program is awarded to us, there will be substantial growth in that bucket. And the headwinds, I guess, like I said, now let's tactically kind of walk through the 2021 outlook of roughly $67 billion and how that translates as we look ahead to 2022. Obviously, you look at the map, and we're down about $1 billion. The obvious large year-to-year headwind is related to the AWE renationalization, which I believe either Jim or I talked about in our script as being a headwind of just under $900 million. The second headwind you'll see on our F-35 revenue chart, we're projecting a decrease in F-35 production-related revenue of about $400 million moving from $21 million to $22 million. And then we have 2 programs that are sort of international life cycle evolution, very successful programs, but they've delivered out, and that's the Black Hawk helicopter program. And by delivered out, I mean moving down from the peak. The number of helicopters we're going to deliver this year will be cut in half by the time we're 2 years out. And then our highly successful next-generation OPIR program. Both of those programs moving from '21 to '22, if you combine the downtick in revenue, it aggregates to about $600 million. And then one of the other external factors was the recently announced and executed withdrawal of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. The primary impact to us is in a contract of a special ops logistics support program. We had some other Afghan drawdown related impacts. In total, it's about a $200 million year-over-year headwind. But now as I pivot to the plus side, one of the programs that's ramping up year-over-year is one of those in the, I'd call it, competitive category that we talked about. It's the next-generation interceptor, where we're doing about $200 million in revenue in 2021. We expect to do about $600 million of revenue in 2022. We have a lot of growth, as we mentioned, within our classified activity. A lot of that activity is being done in our Skunk Works organization within Aeronautics. That work is going to be growing about $400 million year-over-year. And the final large program of record growth is in the CH-53K heavy lift where we'd expect to see $300 million year-over-year growth. So on balance, it's down. The headwind is removal of the AWE activity we were doing."

You saw those 2, you get the $875 million level of activity we saw probably higher than what you might have remembered because you had a lot of wrap-up associated activity that took place, but it was $875 million in 2021 that won't recur. And maybe what I'll do is do a high level sort of around the horn of how those -- the headwinds and tailwinds play out by segment. I mean, the first segment we talked about is Aeronautics. As we look ahead to '22, we're expecting low single-digit growth rates in Aeronautics with a slight increase in margins think of it in the 10, 20 basis point range. 
Within Missiles and Fire Control, we're actually expecting a slight decline, although -- think of it as a low single-digit decline with margins slightly lower than 2021 levels at, again, 10 to 20 basis points. If you go to RMS, we're expecting a low single-digit decline as well with margins maybe up to 40 basis points below what we're going to end up with in 2021. And then finally, at Space, we're expecting mid-single-digit declines. Obviously, that's where the reduction takes place with margins kind of comparable to what we're expecting for 2021."

So in 2022, it's kind of a wash between, let's call it, those 2 programs. And then similarly, we get combat rescue helicopter upside, maybe $100 million, but probably VH will -- the plan is VH-92A production down about $100 million to $150 million. They offset. You might remember that we were part of the Australian Future conventional sub program. Well, that's gotten deferred into nuclear submarine propulsion option. And we're going to compete for that, but it's going to be a while before that kicks in. So there's another 150. So there are puts and takes in every BA, if you will, and it's part of, again, new administration, some changes in priorities, changes in alliances, I think they all settle out to the good, but it's going to take a couple of years to get through all that kind of maneuvering and we're going to do the best we can in the next couple of years to make sure that if there's a flattish period for our company as far as revenue. We're going to really double down or triple down on returning cash to shareholders because we've got it. And the other thing I'd say, George, real quick to add on to something that John said earlier, we are voluntarily continuing our acceleration of payments to supply chain. This is something for the good of the industry, for the good of the customer. And we want to contribute as all of us in our own ways in this country to recovering from COVID.

I mean they're supplying to both commercial aerospace and defense. So if we're looking at parts of the supply chain that are strictly defense, they're probably not nearly as stressed financially as our dual-use suppliers, people that are -- they'll make landing gear for us and they'll make landing gear for commercial aircraft, they make brakes. And -- those are the suppliers that have fixed operating costs that have seen substantial revenue decreases on the commercial supply side that have really cut into their operating cash flow. And we think -- It's the right thing to do. We have access to capital. We have access to cash at extremely good rates. We generate a lot of cash flow. It's -- and as Jim said, it's in the industry's interest, it's in our customers' interest. And frankly, there is an element of self-preservation here. We need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful. So while it's voluntary, it's not 100% altruistic. I mean we need to make commitments, we need, especially our dual-use vendors and partners or supply chain partners to be successful for the long term."

Well, when you're running a business, Ron, in a dynamic industry with changing government when the government is a major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy of the company. We're going",755,"Yes. Well, when you're running a business, Ron, in a dynamic industry with changing government when the government is a major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy of the company. We're going to deliver on our programs and record. We're going to drive operational excellence, but we're driving it towards a mission-oriented paradigm at the end of the day at Lockheed Martin versus a product paradigm, which we've been operating under since at least before World War 2. So that paradigm is still there. We're working towards it. In the meantime, we got to deliver for you all as the shareholders financially, and we've got to deliver for our customers operationally. But I'm getting -- I'd like to think tremendous traction with senior government officials in the U.S. and elsewhere that understand that while our industry and their purchase of our products and services over the years has been effective. It's largely effective in the physical world, if you will, in the [indiscernible] world. We're really good at technologies like hypersonics, space travel, precision weapons, et cetera. Those are in the new Tony and world. We're really good at that as an industry and our customer knows how to buy that stuff. We're not as good as we need to be in the defense industry is merging that excellence in the physical world that we can bring to National Defense, but merging that with the developments -- the accelerated developments in the digital world, by companies that have specialized in things like 5G and AI and distributed computing and networking because if we merge those 2 things together and the ways that we're forecasting and we're building technology road maps to do, we will increase the effectiveness of our current set of platforms in a faster and more robust way than can be done just using the physical attributes in the physical world technologies. We're going to keep doing all that, but we can actually turn on an afterburner for mission capability for our customers by accelerating those digital technologies into our space, and that is our strategy. The benefit of that is, in addition to having a more effective national defense at a relatively efficient cost is that it will make our platforms more attractive than relative to other OEMs platforms because we intend to build the architecture first with pathfinders with some of our platforms and bringing others as we get some success. So that is the strategy of the company. It has not changed in iota, but our capital allocation strategies have not changed because of dynamic situation that we find ourselves in externally. And our M&A approach has had to evolve because there's not that much supply out there in our industry as far as acquisition candidates of any scale and the regulatory environment is also shifting a bit. So we're shifting with it, and we're saying, okay, we still got our baseline strategy, 21st Century Warfare is where we need to end up down the road with our customer. We wanted to get there partly through acquisition, like Aerojet Rocketdyne and i3 to get the technologies mainly in the physical world that we need to move those things forward. But the M&A window isn't that open right now for valuation, availability and regulatory regime. So we're just being and doing the things that you have to do when you're running an actual business in the real world, which is be agile. The one thing I want to add to that because there may be some misconception about, Ron, thank you for the question, by the way, it opens up. I want to make absolutely clear that our M&A approach does not and has not included the acquisition of major commercial technology or telecom companies. We're not trying to become that. We want to use their IP, their people to accelerate that kind of technology, that digital technology into our world. So our approach is to partner with industry leaders in those spaces via commercial agreements, licensing, joint teaming and participation in standards bodies to accelerate those capabilities into our technology road maps. We have no intention of acquiring and merging with any of those major commercial sector companies. So yes, you got to be dynamic and agile when you run a business this big in the real world, and that's what we're up to, and we still have our target being the path finder towards 21st Century National Defense."

We've got a lot of really bright creative scientists and engineers, but we don't have to invent the solution to every single problem. And historically, we struggled with some level of not invented here, which is probably may come as no surprise to some of you. So what Jim has been stressing and our team is getting is we need to identify and partner with whoever does have the best solution in an industry agnostic manner. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of that in our Ventures investment fund where we're going to startups and seeing the art of the possible, we're starting to get pull demand from the business areas for some of these technologies, which I personally view is a huge step in the right direction. And he's driving that mindset, the openness to technology across the entire R&D and engineering community. So I haven't seen a change, and I appreciate the direction from an internal perspective."

Our excess cash balances would allow us to do the $6 billion we're talking about and still have enough liquidity to run the business. So that's point one. this $6 billion is is just deploying what would otherwise have been set in my bank account earning 25 basis points. That's point one. Point two, with ARD, our original expectation was we would probably finance, call it, $3 billion of the $4.5 billion and use cash for the other $1.5 billion. I'm leaning now towards, especially given how low financing rates are maybe financing the entire acquisition. But kind of more broadly, the way I think about acquisitions, and I know Jim and I are absolutely in a 100% violent agreement on this, if you can find M&A that has the right operational fit, the right culture fit and the right strategic fit, M&A pays for itself. I mean it's free, you have to finance them upfront. But if it's a good deal, you're going to get your money back very quickly. So I view like Jim does M&A is not a drain on your balance sheet. Our balance sheet, as you know, is single A. Our metrics would support a higher rating were A- for the 2 that do use the A scale. Conversations I've been having was it's hard to justify why we're an A- instead of a flat -- The punchline is we've got a tremendous amount of firepower.

But when I look at where F-35 is today, 1 of the big challenges there is an integration program, and it's been tech refresh 3 that I think by any measure, has not gone the way it has been hoped. Can you talk about where Tech Refresh 3, the move to Block IV stands today, what risks that may pose for F-35 rates going forward. But then also, if you extrapolate that. And if I am to think about doing broader systems architectures across domains, how do I get confident that the integration capabilities you have are the best to deliver on that. So it's the combination of both the F-35 situation and taking that to a long-term strategy."

TR3 gives you and I supply these jets similar ones at least. It gives you a better pit display, more processing for data in the airplane and more data storage in the airplane. All good things for a 21st century worker. Although they are not essential to be getting the journey into networking that jet more closely with other systems and other platforms. So we are doing those 2 things in parallel because I think they're independent. TR3 has also been delayed a bit. We're working with the GPO. We feel we're on a common schedule now. We've got some significant supply chain issues that we've had to embed our own engineers into our suppliers to try to get them to perform. We're counting on them. That's important. But it's not going to turn or defer us from our goal of really developing the F-35 platform to be the aeronautic cornerstone of our architecture for 21st Century Warfare because, yes, once TR3 is in, it will take another leapfrog up in data storage and data processing capabilities and networking capabilities, which we will add. But we're already demonstrating how to do that with a hybrid base station that we actually fly in a U2 that provides that connectivity today with the [indiscernible] equipment on the jet. So these things are related, but not differential or coterminous. They don't be coterminous. We will get both of these jobs done. And in the broader program here, what we've I think derived by working with our government customers so far and understanding contracts and things is that there won't be a overarching at C2 of any kind. What there will be is in reality in this business, and I think in our customer construct, is that technology road map and this has been developed more since maybe the last time you and I talked about this, Doug. But is going to be a technology road map, which is platform-by-platform connectivity using open architecture set of standards and protocols that the whole industry could share. And we're going to be doing that one stage at a time. And what I want to do and I have to talk to our customers about at the most senior level is to provide every 6 to 12 months a mission capability by implementing this technology road map, mission by mission. Now we've got 14 missions and we've got 14 technologies coincidentally, that we have completed 3 of those missions, which happened to be counter air surface warfare and integrated air and missile defense. We're showing customers those road maps and getting feedback on what platforms we should be tying together first and getting those sensors decision-making command and control systems and actual effectors connected in the most optimal way every 6 to 12 months. So we're moving out on both fronts. TR3 is, again, associated, but not essential for moving out on the 21st Century Warfare front."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. In a few moments, John will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But",1274,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. In a few moments, John will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But first, I will provide a 5-year sales outlook and discuss our plans for accelerating capabilities to our customers and driving per share value to our shareholders over that time horizon.
Last month, I led our executive leadership team as we completed our annual strategic and financial planning process. Given the scope of changes in our operating environment over the past year, we conducted a more in-depth and extended assessment of our financial forecast. Based on these strategic and financial reviews and the information available to us today, our current expectation is that sales in 2022 will decline slightly from our expected 2021 sales level. 
We then anticipate sales will increase slightly in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. This sales trajectory reflects a number of factors, including the continuing effects of the ongoing COVID pandemic and extended delivery time lines across our supply chain, moderating growth rates in the U.S. defense budget, shifts in customer priorities driven by recent events such as the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and the renationalization of the AWE program in the U.K. and our recently completed agreement with the F-35 joint program office on a rebaselining of aircraft deliveries under our production program. I'll address this significant agreement a little later in my remarks. 
As with all forward projections, our performance on current programs, our ability to win highly competitive new starts, the size of future defense budgets and the global geopolitical landscape will all influence our ultimate growth rate over the coming 5 years. But as we look ahead, there are 4 primary areas that underpin our longer-term growth forecast. The first of these future growth areas is within our hypersonics portfolio. 
We are currently performing on 6 hypersonic programs across the company and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity, multiple programs are expected to enter production between 2023 and 2026. The second growth area is within our classified activity. 3 of our 4 business areas are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs, we expect to begin the transition from development to production again between 23 and 26. 
The third area of expected growth lies in our current programs of record. Our portfolio is very well aligned with our customers' mission requirements. And as a result, we have multiple programs from each business area entering growth stages. This includes the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, F-35 sustainment activity, increased PAC-3 production rates and the modernization and enhancements to the fleet ballistic missile. 
And finally, we're in competition for several significant new business awards, including the future vertical lift and FARA competitions, the next-generation interceptor program, and the KC-Y Tanker program. These represent meaningful opportunities to accelerate our projected top line growth profile with new long-term projects that are critical to our national defense.
Now I'd like to discuss our strategy for driving strong returns for our shareholders in the near term while remaining well positioned for our expected return to growth in 2023. The central tenet of our value creation strategy is using a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. We will first reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers' requirements and drive organic growth.
Concurrently, we will continue pursuing actionable inorganic growth opportunities that strengthen our core business. And we will return cash to shareholders through increasing dividend payments and a significantly expanded share repurchase program. 
To drive sustainable organic growth, we will continue making significant investments in our business area. These investments include nearly $2 billion of annual capital expenditures and approximately $1.5 billion in independent research and development spending each year. These investments are being made in our signature platforms and systems to provide our customers with the high-value solutions they're going to need to execute their missions of deterring if necessary, to feeding the pacing threats across all the domains of operations. 
Additionally, we are transforming our internal operations with a model-based engineering and enterprise architecture and we are building digital factories of the future. These investments in state-of-the-art engineering, manufacturing and sustainment tools and techniques will ensure our business areas can continue delivering outstanding performance levels on current programs while also positioning us to prevail in upcoming campaigns. 
After making these significant investments in our business to support our customers and drive organic growth, we expect to have substantial free cash flows available to return to you to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last month, the Board increased our quarterly dividend by $0.20 or approximately 8% to $2.80 per share and now $11.20 per share annually, providing shareholders, especially our yield investors with strong returns. This action marks the 20th consecutive year that the Board has increased Lockheed Martin's quarterly dividend.
Along with making an increased quarterly dividend payment, we will also provide additional value to shareholders by returning excess cash to them through a greatly expanded share repurchase program. As discussed in today's press release, we've already repurchased $2 billion of our shares through the first 3 quarters of 2021. 
And last month, on my recommendation, the Board increased our remaining share repurchase authority by $5 billion, bringing our current total share repurchase authority to approximately $6 billion. With our stock trading at the level well below what we calculate as the company's intrinsic value, we have significantly increased our planned share buybacks, and I anticipate that we will repurchase up to $6 billion of our shares over the next 12 to 18 months if conditions warrant.
As a final note on shareholder value, we are going to dynamically allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, prioritizing investments that lead to growing free cash flow per share. That's our new metric. We will remain opportunistic in pursuing accretive bolt-on acquisitions, evaluate additional increases to our current share repurchase authorization and continue to reinvest capital into our business to drive long-term growth.
We have the balance sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue multiple avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders. We built this balance sheet to use it, and we will do so, consistent with our focus on long-term shareholder value creation. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the capability to close on the Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction, provide robust returns to shareholders and continue to invest in our portfolio to support our customers and drive future growth.
The Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction continues moving through the regulatory approval process and we now anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to highlight the efforts of the entire F-35 organization, including the government's joint program office, our teammates and suppliers, our aeronautics organization and our international partners for establishing a new aircraft production baseline and delivery profile that will provide industry, government, partner countries and FMS customers as well as you, the investor community with important visibility well into the future.
The program is strong and stable, and we have opportunities ahead of us to add to that strength. The program has delivered over 700 production aircraft out of a plan of record of over 3,300 jets, including to all 3 U.S. services and 9 international customers so far, and we look forward to continuing the successful program for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to John and I'll rejoin you to answer your questions."
285827,1684273589,2413191,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of third quarter activity. Starting with sales, we repo",1646,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of third quarter activity. Starting with sales, we reported revenue of $16 billion. This result was below our expectation as we realized larger-than-anticipated supply chain impacts across Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and Space. These impacts span multiple suppliers, and our expectation is that we will incrementally recover from these disruptions over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Despite this reduction in sales volume, our segment operating profit increased year-over-year to $1.9 billion on strong operational performance across the enterprise. Our earnings per share of $2.21 included a noncash charge of $4.72 related to our previously announced pension transaction. We generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations and continued our practice of accelerating payments to our supply chain with $1.5 billion in accelerated payments at quarter end.
The supply chain disruptions we experienced during the third quarter underscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic. In addition, we continue to return substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchase activity. And we have provided trending data for 2022, which we will discuss further in a few minutes.
Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. As we noted in our earnings release, our third quarter sales are below 2020 levels, primarily because of the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program in our space business area. Our third quarter sales also reflect recent supply chain delays, most notably on the F-35 production activity and on several production programs within both Missiles and Fire Control and Space. 
Despite this reduction in sales volume, our third quarter segment operating profit is up from last year as strong operational performance resulted in significant risk retirements across all 4 business areas. 
Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the quarter. Our earnings per share of $2.21 incorporates a $4.72 noncash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer we completed back in August. On an adjusted basis, our pre-transaction earnings per share of $6.93 and was 11% higher than our 2020 results due to improved segment operating margins, reduced share count and another quarter of mark-to-market gains across our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio. 
While future volatility associated with investments in early-stage companies as expected, the significant gains realized across multiple holdings in our ventures portfolio, reinforce the value of investing in and partnering with companies focused on cutting-edge technologies. 
On Chart 6, we will look at our year-to-date cash generation and deployment. Subtracting our capital expenditures from almost $5 billion of cash from operations, our year-to-date free cash flow is greater than $4 billion. We've repurchased $2 billion of shares year-to-date, including $500 million during the third quarter and have made more than $2 billion in dividend payments. In total, our balanced cash deployment of nearly $4.2 billion represents over 100% of free cash flow returned to our shareholders year-to-date. And we will continue these shareholder-friendly actions going forward as evidenced by our recent dividend increase and share repurchase program announcements. 
Moving on to Chart 7 and our 2021 guidance update. We've lowered our 2021 outlook for sales and segment operating profit to reflect the previously discussed supply chain impacts that emerged in August and September. We've reduced our outlook for cash from operations primarily to reflect our updated plan to maintain our current $1.5 billion level of accelerated payments to our supply chain. We plan to continue supporting our suppliers as they recover from pandemic-related impacts, especially small and medium businesses, both across the country and internationally, to help maintain program schedules and customer missions.  The full year outlook for earnings per share has increased $0.35 from the midpoint of last quarter's range driven by Lockheed Martin Ventures investment gains in several nonoperational items. 
Now turning to Chart 8. We take a closer look at the current year revisions to 2021 sales by business area. As discussed, Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and Space have all been affected by lower-than-anticipated activity coming through our supply chain. The level of reduction in supply chain activity over the past 2 months is higher than what we've been experiencing since the beginning of the pandemic, and our 2021 sales outlook assumes that we will see a return to more normal activity levels in the fourth quarter. In addition, our sales outlook for 2021 and our trending information for 2022 excludes any potential impacts associated with the recent executive order on safety protocols for federal contractors.
On Chart 9, we see segment operating profit tracking with the reduction in expected sales volume and our expected segment operating margin outlook remains at 11%. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our initial trending information for 2022. We've estimated 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion, a decline of 1.5% from our projected 2021 results. As a reminder, the renationalization of our work in support of the United Kingdom's Atomic Weapons Establishment earlier this year creates a headwind of just under $900 million on a year-over-year basis. 
We are expecting segment operating margins to remain at approximately 11%, and we are projecting growth in cash from operations year-over-year to greater than or equal to $8.4 billion. This outlook assumes there will be no increase in tax payments related to capitalizing R&D costs. If current legislation is not amended, our cash from operations outlook could be reduced by up to $2 billion. 
Also, given we continue experiencing impacts across our supply chain, we now anticipate maintaining accelerated payments at the current $1.5 billion level through year-end 2022. Our prior multiyear cash forecast assume there would no longer be a need to accelerate payments to our supply chain beyond 2021. We are currently assuming a statutory corporate tax rate of 21% and we have not included any financial projections associated with closing the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, which, as Jim mentioned, is now expected to occur during the first quarter of 2022, subject to required regulatory approval. 
Turning to pension-related assumptions. Interest rates have increased since year-end 2020. Our year-to-date actual returns have been higher than previously expected and we've lowered our long-term rate of return to 6.5%. And in response to investors asking for additional information on pension trends, we have included 2 charts on this topic in the appendix. These trends include no required pension contributions through 2025 based on current assumptions. 
On Chart 11, we outlined our expected capital deployment activities for 2022. We anticipate spending approximately $2 billion on capital projects next year, which represents an increase of approximately $300 million over expected 2021 levels. In addition, we anticipate investing approximately $1.5 billion on independent research and development activities, which represents a $200 million increase over planned 2021 levels. These investments are being made to enhance our delivery of critical systems and products to our customers as they execute their national security missions while ensuring we are well positioned to compete for new business opportunities. 
We will be making over $3 billion in dividend payments next year based on a recently announced $0.20 per share increase to our quarterly dividend rate. And as Jim shared earlier, we will also continue to strategically buy back shares when we believe they are trading below intrinsic value as they are now. We are planning to opportunistically repurchase up to $6 billion in shares over the next 12 to 18 months. We are confident we have the balance sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue all avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders.
On Chart 12, we provide some additional detail on our expected long-term trajectory for F-35 sales. As Jim commented earlier, we recently reached agreement with the joint program office on our expected F-35 delivery plan. This joint plan represents the best intersection of production operations and supply chain capabilities, technology insertion in support of increasing mission requirements and both the timing and quantity of anticipated new production aircraft award decisions. We are very pleased with the outcome of this joint production replan as it provides stability and predictability across all key elements of this program.
Deliveries are expected to grow to 156 aircraft by 2023 and will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. We are projecting F-35 production sales in 2022 will be lower than 2021 levels and sales will also decline slightly in 2023. Revenues are expected to remain around 2023 levels throughout the balance of the forecasted time frame. As we've previously discussed, the growth in F-35 sales volume will primarily be driven by sustainment activity as the number of deployed aircraft and associated flight hours grows rapidly while we continue to aggressively pursue cost takeout in partnership with our customer. Finally, we are also projecting modest growth in development activity as our customers continue seeking further advancements and capabilities for our unrivaled 5th generation aircraft. 
To conclude, on Chart 14, we have our summary. We've reduced our 2021 outlook based on the higher-than-expected supply chain impacts we experienced during the third quarter. The supply chain and related production impacts, along with our updated F-35 production plan and the other factors Jim mentioned, have shaped our outlook for 2022 and our future expectations. Our strong balance sheet and cash generation give us multiple options to deploy cash. And to echo Jim, we will prioritize investments, which will grow free cash flow per share. And with our broad portfolio, dedicated employees, strong balance sheet and a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy, we remain focused on our customers' mission and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A."

What's the baseline budget that you're assuming in your guide? And specifically, if the plus ups to the President's request from HaaS and SaaS were included, did that imply some upside to your '22 guide? Or is it just too late for fiscal '22 funding to have an impact? 
And the second part to my question is, so you lowered your cash from operations guide for '22. I want to know if you could discuss a bit more about what you think cash flow looks like beyond '22 and what you're assuming along with that."

I'll take both parts of that 2-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budgetary based on, we're using the President's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trendin",489,"Yes. Thanks, Rich. It's John. I'll take both parts of that 2-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budgetary based on, we're using the President's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trending information we've given you. I'd say we're encouraged about the direction of the various committee markups as they reflect really good support for a number of our programs. 
And to your question about how much -- if any of this will come through in 2022, the answer to that question is going to be based on how much incremental funding is actually appropriated, how long it takes for that appropriated funding to end up getting on contract with us and us flowing that down to our supply chain. And then the third factor is what specific programs the incremental appropriations are applied to. It's easier, obviously, to maintain programs at current run rates than it is to accelerate program. 
So any programs that we're planning sort of a trend down would be really good candidates for being able to see opportunities in 2022 related to increased appropriations. And I'll kind of finish this section by saying obviously, by the time we're in January, when we've given you an updated outlook for 2022, we should have a lot more clarity in and around the budgetary trends. 
Now turning to your -- the second part, which I had to do with -- we've previously given multiyear cash -- operating cash flow guidance. And of course, all these metrics are going to be assuming the R&D tax change does not go into effect. Our prior guidance was like $8.9 billion, $9 billion and $9.1 billion. You've seen we've got our guidance now at $8.3 billion for this year and $8.4 billion for next year. And I'll say we anticipate higher than $8.4 billion operating cash flow guidance as we look ahead to 2023. But really, the only factor that's changed since the multiyear guidance we gave before is in the level and the duration of the accelerated payments we're planning to make to our supply chain. 
I think I mentioned in the script, we have previously in that $8.9 billion, $9 billion and $9.1 billion track assume we would be accelerating $1.2 billion worth of accelerated -- of payments to the supply chain at year-end -- at the end of this year. But then the assumption was the pandemic would be behind us in 2022. We'd unwind that program. We'd end 2022 with no accelerated payments being made through our supply chain. Our current forecast, the $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion assumes $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of this year and $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of 2022. So if the pandemic impacts are behind us before we end year-end 2022, our guide of $8.4 billion would increase by that $1.5 billion."

The 4 categories that Jim mentioned in his scripted remarks, hypersonics classified growth and programs of record and competitive new starts. When I look",373,"Yes, absolutely. So Rob, I mean just to kind of footstop what Jim was saying to give a little color. The 4 categories that Jim mentioned in his scripted remarks, hypersonics classified growth and programs of record and competitive new starts. When I look at that subset of revenue for those 4 categories in 2021 is sort of in the neighborhood of $17 billion. Over the period going out through, for the next 5 years, that set of activity, assuming we hit our operational marks, assuming these  programs continue on their programs of record, and we win our share of these competitive new business opportunities that we've talked about. That $17 billion worth of program revenue today will grow at about a 9% compound annual growth rate, which gives me some level of comfort that the longer-term trends that Jim has talked about will hold.
Just to reiterate, we're expecting a slight decline in '22, a bounce back in 2023. And then I would say, increasing growth and increasing growth rates going forward. Now -- yes, on the topic of margins, I think 11% is a good working target for us given the evolution in our portfolio and the activity that we see going forward. I just highlighted the 4 categories that we'll be seeing growth. A lot of those are new start programs. There is going to be some growth in programs of record, which we would hope to turn into accretive margin programs. But there is a lot of growth in new start areas, developmental areas. 
The good news is we will get -- there will be cost reimbursable contracts. We'll have assurance of recovery of the costs we're incurring, but they, by definition, will be lower margin activities moving forward. And I should mention, and this is just to get this on the record early, there are certain classified activities that we can't talk about. But if those programs continue to progress along the track that they're on. My expectation is we will be making investments in some of those programs out in the '23, '24, '25 time frame that will be dilutive to margins. But I think in balance, an 11% operating margin is a good metric for us."

And then maybe now as good a time as any to talk specifically about sort of what we're seeing moving from '21 to '22 and the headwinds. But",993,"Yes, sure, Mike. It's John. I'll take and I'll talk thematically first through the 4 buckets and growth over time. And then maybe now as good a time as any to talk specifically about sort of what we're seeing moving from '21 to '22 and the headwinds. But the 4 big buckets, the first one is hypersonic activity. Today, we're doing about $1.5 billion worth of revenue in that area. If we are able to move a number of those activities into a -- from development into production, which we fully expect will happen. We're making great progress on a number of them that are visible and are being reported on today.
But our projection would be assuming a number of those activities proceed into a production environment that $1.5 billion to grow as high as $3 billion by 2026. The second area classified in -- I'll say upfront, we hesitated even highlighting this given there's not a lot that we can say in general about classified activity. But because it is a large and growing component of our business, we thought it was important to at least give you a top-level trend information. And because like I said, we will be making investments in some of this activity downstream, which will have dilutive impacts, thought it was a good idea to talk about.
But in aggregate, our classified portfolio will grow, we expect at a rate above 5%. So that is a strong growing area for us. The programs of record, which, as Jim took through some of the big ones he mentioned would be CH-53K, F-35 sustainment, the PAC-3 program and an additional growth in the fleet ballistic missile and evolutions and new advances in that program. That portfolio today is worth about $8.5 billion. When we project out to 2026, over that period of time, the compound annual growth rate in that program set is like an 8%. And it's highlighted by CH-53K, where we will be delivering out to a program of record of 200 units. I think the final deliveries are made in 2032.
But just keeping that program on its program of record will go a long way towards us achieving that growth in the program of record and CAGR that I just talked about. And then the final area is the new business which are a set of sort of wildcards, you're going to get binary decisions in and around the FLRAA competition or the FARA competition. One of the new business areas that Jim talked about is next-generation interceptor. We've successfully moved into a down select where there's ourselves and one other competitor. We're making great progress. We've achieved a number of important program milestones recently. We feel good about where we're heading.
But that will be a down select and then sort of the wildcard in the bunch and opportunity we're very excited about is the KC-Y tanker program, where we've announced that we will be teaming with Airbus, who we think has a very capable frame for doing this mission. I think we bring extensive experience in the mission capabilities that would go on to that airframe. I think we make a very formidable team. We're very excited about that opportunity. 
And depending on outcomes, I mean, obviously, as we're doing next to nothing in either -- any of those programs besides the next-generation interceptor, that growth rate could be explosive. If we prevail on FLRAA and FARA, which we think we're very well positioned to do, if we're down selected on NGI and tanker program is awarded to us, there will be substantial growth in that bucket. And the headwinds, I guess, like I said, now let's tactically kind of walk through the 2021 outlook of roughly $67 billion and how that translates as we look ahead to 2022.
Obviously, you look at the map, and we're down about $1 billion. The obvious large year-to-year headwind is related to the AWE renationalization, which I believe either Jim or I talked about in our script as being a headwind of just under $900 million. The second headwind you'll see on our F-35 revenue chart, we're projecting a decrease in F-35 production-related revenue of about $400 million moving from '21 to '22. 
And then we have 2 programs that are sort of in their natural life cycle evolution, very successful programs, but they've delivered out, and that's the Black Hawk helicopter program. And by delivered out, I mean moving down from the peak. The number of helicopters we're going to deliver this year will be cut in half by the time we're 2 years out. And then our highly successful next-generation OPIR program. Both of those programs moving from '21 to '22, if you combine the downtick in revenue, it aggregates to about $600 million.
And then one of the other external factors was the recently announced and executed withdrawal of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. The primary impact to us is in a contract -- special ops logistics support program. We had some other Afghan drawdown related impacts. In total, it's about a $200 million year-over-year headwind. But now as I pivot to the plus side, one of the programs that's ramping up year-over-year is one of those in the, I'd call it, competitive category that we talked about. It's the next-generation interceptor, where we're doing about $200 million in revenue in 2021. We expect to do about $600 million of revenue in 2022.
We have a lot of growth, as we mentioned, within our classified activity. A lot of that activity is being done in our Skunk Works organization within Aeronautics. That work is going to be growing about $400 million year-over-year. And the final large program of record growth is in the CH-53K heavy lift where we'd expect to see $300 million year-over-year growth. So on balance, it's down. The headwind is removal of the AWE activity we were doing."

So if you go back to like our first and second quarter press releases, and we probably have it in the year-to-date, AWE first quarter activity this year was $440 million.

You sum those 2, you get the $875 million level of activity we saw probably higher than what you might have remembered because you had a lot of wrap-up associated activity that took place, but it was $875 million in 2021 that won't recur. 
And maybe what I'll do is do a high level sort of around the horn of how those -- the headwinds and tailwinds play out by segment. I mean, the first segment we talked about is Aeronautics. As we look ahead to '22, we're expecting low single-digit growth rates in Aeronautics with a slight increase in margins think of it in the 10, 20 basis point range. 
Within Missiles and Fire Control, we're actually expecting a slight decline, although -- think of it as a low single-digit decline with margins slightly lower than 2021 levels at, again, 10 to 20 basis points. If you go to RMS, we're expecting a low single-digit decline as well with margins maybe up to 40 basis points below what we're going to end up with in 2021. And then finally, at Space, we're expecting mid-single-digit declines. Obviously, that's where the AWE reduction takes place with margins kind of comparable to what we're expecting for 2021."

So in 2022, it's kind of a watch between, let's call it, those 2 programs. And then similarly, we get combat rescue helicopter upside, maybe $100 million, but probably VH will -- the plan is VH-92A production down about $100 million to $150 million and they offset.
You might remember that we were part of the Australian Future conventional sub program. Well, that's gotten deferred into nuclear submarine propulsion option. And we're going to compete for that, but it's going to be a while before that kicks in. So there's another $150 million. So there are puts and takes in every BA, if you will, and it's part of, again, new administration, some changes in priorities, changes in alliances, I think they all settle out to the good, but it's going to take a couple of years to get through all that kind of maneuvering and we're going to do the best we can in the next couple of years to make sure that if there's a flattish period for our company as far as revenue, we're going to really double down or triple down on returning cash to shareholders because we've got it.
And the other thing I'd say, George, real quick to add on to something that John said earlier, we are voluntarily continuing our acceleration of payments to supply chain. This is something for the good of the industry, for the good of the customer. And we want to contribute as all of us in our own ways in this country to recovering from COVID. And again when -- as John said, when COVID subsides, we will get that cash flow number back to where you thought it was going to be in the first place.

And -- those are the suppliers that have fixed operating costs that have seen substantial revenue decreases on the commercial supply side that have really cut into their operating cash flow.
And we think -- It's the right thing to do. We have access to capital. We have access to cash at extremely good rates. We generate a lot of cash flow. It's -- and as Jim said, it's in the industry's interest, it's in our customers' interest. And frankly, there is an element of self-preservation here. We need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful. So while it's voluntary, it's not 100% altruistic.

Well, when you're running a business, Ron, in a dynamic industry with changing government when the government is a major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy of the company. We're going",751,"Yes. Well, when you're running a business, Ron, in a dynamic industry with changing government when the government is a major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy of the company. We're going to deliver on our programs and record. We're going to drive operational excellence, but we're driving it towards a mission-oriented paradigm at the end of the day at Lockheed Martin versus a product paradigm, which we've been operating under since at least before World War 2.
So that paradigm is still there. We're working towards it. In the meantime, we got to deliver for you all as the shareholders financially, and we've got to deliver for our customers operationally. But I'm getting -- I'd like to think tremendous traction with senior government officials in the U.S. and elsewhere that understand that while our industry and their purchase of our products and services over the years has been effective. It's largely effective in the physical world, if you will, in the Newtonian world.
We're really good at technologies like hypersonics, space travel, precision weapons, et cetera. Those are in the Newtonian world. We're really good at that as an industry and our customer knows how to buy that stuff. We're not as good as we need to be in the defense industry is merging that excellence in the physical world that we can bring to National Defense, but merging that with the developments -- the accelerated developments in the digital world, by companies that have specialized in things like 5G and AI and distributed computing and networking because if we merge those 2 things together and the ways that we're forecasting and we're building technology road maps to do, we will increase the effectiveness of our current set of platforms in a faster and more robust way than can be done just using the physical attributes in the physical world technologies.
We're going to keep doing all that, but we can actually turn on an afterburner for mission capability for our customers by accelerating those digital technologies into our space, and that is our strategy. The benefit of that is, in addition to having a more effective national defense at a relatively efficient cost is that it will make our platforms more attractive than relative to other OEMs platforms because we intend to build the architecture first with pathfinders with some of our platforms and bringing others as we get some success. So that is the strategy of the company. It has not changed in iota, but our capital allocation strategies have not changed because of dynamic situation that we find ourselves in externally.
And our M&A approach had to evolve because there's not that much supply out there in our industry as far as acquisition candidates of any scale and the regulatory environment is also shifting a bit. So we're shifting with it, and we're saying, okay, we still got our baseline strategy, 21st Century Warfare is where we need to end up down the road with our customer. We wanted to get there partly through acquisition, like Aerojet Rocketdyne and i3 to get the technologies mainly in the physical world that we need to move those things forward. But the M&A window isn't that open right now for valuation, availability and regulatory regime.
So we're just being and doing the things that you have to do when you're running an actual business in the real world, which is being agile. The one thing I want to add to that because there may be some misconception about, Ron, thank you for the question, by the way, it opens up. I want to make absolutely clear that our M&A approach does not and has not included the acquisition of major commercial technology or telecom companies. We're not trying to become that. We want to use their IP, their people to accelerate that kind of technology, that digital technology into our world.
So our approach is to partner with industry leaders in those spaces via commercial agreements, licensing, joint teaming and participation in standards bodies to accelerate those capabilities into our technology road maps. We have no intention of acquiring and merging with any of those major commercial sector companies. So yes, you got to be dynamic and agile when you run a business this big in the real world, and that's what we're up to, and we still have our target being the pathfinder towards 21st Century National Defense."

If you look at our operating cash flow and free cash flow, our net debt retirements over the -- I'll stick to the first 3 years of the plan. Our excess cash balances would allow us to do the $6 billion we're talking about and still have enough liquidity to run the business. So that's point one. This $6 billion is just deploying what would otherwise have been set in my bank account earning 25 basis points. That's point one. 
Point two, with AJRD, our original expectation was we would probably finance, call it, $3 billion of the $4.5 billion and use cash for the other $1.5 billion. I'm leaning now towards, especially given how low financing rates are maybe financing the entire acquisition. But kind of more broadly, the way I think about acquisitions, and I know Jim and I are absolutely in a 100% violent agreement on this, if you can find M&A that has the right operational fit, the right culture fit and the right strategic fit, M&A pays for itself. 
I mean it's free, you have to finance them upfront. But if it's a good deal, you're going to get your money back very quickly. So I view like Jim does M&A is not a drain on your balance sheet. Our balance sheet, as you know, is single A. Our metrics would support a higher rating where A minus for the 2 to do, use the A minus scale. Conversations I've been having was it's hard to justify why we're an A minus instead of a flat -- The punchline is we've got a tremendous amount of firepower. If, as Jim talked about, the discipline and dynamic capital allocation process says we need to put additional resources in here, there or wherever, we're going to have the ability to do that."

Out -- for government fiscal year '23, '24, '25 and out. I see that as a center point again, if we're able though to prevail in competition, I see a path for us to grow faster than that rate. We need to perform on our programs. We need to deliver helicopters and airplanes on our committed schedules. And if we do that, I see upside to the 2% growth that's in the President's budget."

But it's going to go up a couple of hundred million dollars. And then again, if you do puts and takes that special ops logistics support program itself was doing quite better. So in MFC, just that 1 program takes away all the PAC-3 growth year-over-year into '22. And then we had probably not as well known, but for MFC a significant cancellation in the U.K. There's a Warrior armored vehicle program that was canceled by the U.K. government, and that was another $100 million downdraft.
And then that is sort of tailing off a little bit too now in production rates, not much but another $100 million. So you really have to dig into the details in each BA to see why '21, '22, '23 effects are happening. But we really are focusing on 23 -- 2023 plus, so to speak or beyond 2023 because all of these programmatic effects will be known by then. We've got those 4 big areas where we assume and expect that there's going to be material upside. We'll understand that way better at that point. 
And then we'll have some of those new starts that we -- if the competition stay on time, we may know some decisions in those 2. So yes, there's going to be some puts and takes of Lockheed Martin specific in the next couple of years, but we're positioning ourselves to weather this period and get through with a lower share count materially, I think, lower share count by the end of it.  And then a growth vector that has an inclination to it post 2023.

That's -- in the period where you still have an overlap between development and production, that's where you're going to start seeing some bulge. 
And that kind of transition ties into the discussion -- probably through extended discussion I had with Miles about if you look out to 2023 or you cume the 3 years, why you're slightly down from the last guide. I think we're going to be successful. We're going to need to bridge those programs to maintain their critical schedules. So we're going to carry a financial backstop against them.
But there is absolutely no doubt the growth is going to come out of hypersonics, classified and growth in the programs of record. I mean Jim mentioned PAC-3 growing $200 million going from '21 to '22. In '21, we're going to deliver 350 ramps. We're going to be delivering 500 ramps in 2023 and 550 ramps in 2025.

But when I look at where F-35 is today, 1 of the big challenges there is an integration program, and it's been Tech Refresh 3 that I think by any measure, has not gone the way it has been hoped. 
Can you talk about where Tech Refresh 3, the move to Block 4 stands today, what risks that may pose for F-35 rates going forward. But then also, if you extrapolate that. And if I am to think about doing broader systems architectures across domains, how do I get confident that the integration capabilities you have are the best to deliver on that.

TR3 gives you and -- and I used to fly these jets, similar ones at least. It gives you a better cockpit display, more processing for data in the airplane and more data storage in the airplane. All good things for a 21st century warfare. Although they are not essential to be getting the journey into networking that jet more closely with other systems and other platforms. So we are doing those 2 things in parallel because I think they're independent. 
TR3 has also been delayed a bit. We're working with the JPO. We feel we're on a common schedule now. We've got some significant supply chain issues that we've had to embed our own engineers into our suppliers to try to get them to perform. We're counting on them. That's important. But it's not going to turn or defer us from our goal of really developing the F-35 platform to be the aeronautic cornerstone of our architecture for 21st Century Warfare because, yes, once TR3 is in, it will take another leapfrog up in data storage and data processing capabilities and networking capabilities, which we will add.
But we're already demonstrating how to do that with a hybrid base station that we actually fly in a U-2 that provides that connectivity today with the Tech Refresh 2 equipment on the jet. So these things are related, but not differential or coterminous. They don't be coterminous. We will get both of these jobs done. And in the broader program here, what we've I think derived by working with our government customers so far and understanding contracts and things is that there won't be a overarching JADC2C2 of any kind. What there will be is in reality in this business, and I think in our customer construct, is that technology road map and this has been developed more since maybe the last time you and I talked about this, Doug.
But is going to be a technology road map, which is platform-by-platform connectivity using an open architecture set of standards and protocols that the whole industry could share. And we're going to be doing that one stage at a time. And what I want to do and I have to talk to our customers about at the most senior level is to provide every 6 to 12 months a mission capability by implementing this technology road map, mission by mission.
Now we've got 14 missions and we've got 14 technologies coincidentally, that we have completed 3 of those missions, which happened to be counterair surface warfare and integrated air and missile defense. We're showing customers those road maps and getting feedback on what platforms we should be tying together first and getting those sensors decision-making command and control systems and actual effectors connected in the most optimal way every 6 to 12 months. So we're moving out on both fronts. TR3 is, again, associated, but not essential for moving out on the 21st Century Warfare front."
