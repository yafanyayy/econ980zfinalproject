It's nice to be with you as we wrap up 2020. I want to share comments regarding the fourth quarter of the year, but more importantly, provide our 2021 financial outlook, as noted in our earnings release today. Following my comments, Sonia will then share her perspective, followed by Q&A. 
We're very pleased with our progress on our path to our sustainable economic model, which I outlined at our Investor Day in October. Let's talk first about some key accomplishments from 2020 that put us well on our path to achieving our Power Plan 2023. 
First, we remain very pleased with the performance of Old Navy and Athleta, which grew 5% and 29%, respectively, in Q4. Old Navy gained share to become the #2 apparel brand in the U.S., second to Nike, and that's let us surpass $1 billion in sales and grew 16% for the full year despite the pandemic. Combined, they represented 63% of company sales in 2020, on the way to our target of 70% by the end of 2023. Their standout sales performance reflected gains in market share during the fourth quarter, led by their brand strength, omnichannel offerings and relevant product categories. Sonia will talk more about how they compete to win a bit later. 
There is meaningful progress in Gap brand, while total sales for Gap brand global were down in Q4, significantly impacted by pandemic-related market closures and restrictions in international markets. GAAP North America delivered a 1% comp. This underscores the progress the brand is making in the product and operations of its core business. 
We're pleased to have new leadership at Banana Republic. Sandra Stangl and her team will be focused on repositioning Banana Republic for a post-COVID world with relevant marketing and product. 
We are becoming digitally dominant. Our online business grew 54% in 2020 and closed the year at about 45% of total company sales, up from 25% at the end of last year. At over $6 billion, our online channel is ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales. And when leveraged with our well-located fleet, is a strategic advantage in serving our customers through the omnichannel lens. 
Our fleet rationalization is on track and driving significant economic value. In 2020, we closed 228 net Gap and Banana Republic stores globally, ahead of our 225 store closure target. These closures, along with lease negotiations and rent abatement settlements as well as higher online sales, contributed to over 400 basis points of ROD leverage in Q4. 
We are progressing on our goal of improving the profitability of Gap brand as we partner to amplify through asset-light models. The Yeezy partnership is on track for launch in the latter part of the first half of 2021, and we continue to be excited by the creativity that partnership will bring to the brand. 
Our strategic review of Europe market is underway, and we are in process on several licensing deals that we believe will provide great extensions to the brand. We have driven meaningful improvements in product margins with good pricing discipline. And while freight and shipping costs as well as pandemic headwinds have persisted, this margin expansion has provided a partial offset against these rising costs. Several expense levers, strategic store closures and a reduction in force early in the year helped us weather pandemic-related costs this year such as meaningful health and safety costs, and allowed us to lean into demand-generating investments such as marketing. 
Marketing has been a strategic investment this year as we leverage this dislocated apparel market to gain market share. We've undertaken a strategic review of our Intermix business as we continue to focus on our 4 $1 billion brands to drive a more profitable portfolio. And we have generated meaningful free cash flow in the quarter, ending the year with $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
Our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet will enable us to continue investing in growth in 2021 through capital expenditures, while also returning to our long-standing practice of returning cash to shareholders through paying the previously approved dividend in the first quarter and initiating a new dividend in the second quarter. Recognizing the COVID-related challenges faced during 2020, I am very proud of our team and how we remain focused on driving these strategic initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As we look to 2021, despite the significant uncertainty that remains related to the COVID pandemic, we are pleased to provide a 2021 outlook today. For 2021, we expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.35. I will provide more context regarding this range in a moment, but it's important to note that the 2021 guidance range we are providing today was fully contemplated in our Power Plan 2023 and in the 2023 estimated 10% operating margin target we provided in our October investor event. 
So let me move on to a recap of fourth quarter results, starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter were $4.4 billion, down 5% to last year and below our previous outlook. Fourth quarter sales were impacted by a mid-quarter resurgence in the COVID pandemic that resulted in unplanned mandated store closures and restrictions across Canada, Japan, China and Europe as well as new U.S. stay-at-home orders in select densely populated regions such as California and the Northeast, which impacted store traffic. 
The pandemic-related impact to fourth quarter sales is estimated to be approximately 4 percentage points. In addition, the sales decline related to strategically planned permanent store closures had an estimated impact of about 5 percentage points. 
Overall, store sales in Q4 were down 28% as a result of slower traffic in select U.S. markets, COVID-related closures and the strategic closures related to the company's store rationalization initiative. Online sales grew 49% and contributed 46% of the sales in the quarter. We leveraged our omnichannel capabilities such as BOPIS and ship-from-store to serve the customer even as the pandemic surged. Comparable sales were flat in the quarter. Comp sales by brand are in our earnings press release. 
Turning to gross margin. On a reported basis, fourth quarter gross profit totaled $1.7 billion, and gross margin rate was 37.7%, nearly 200 basis points ahead of both last year and the guidance we provided last quarter. Our year-over-year margin expansion is as follows: ROD leveraged 400 basis points from rent and occupancy savings as online sales increased and as we continue to close unprofitable stores, favorably settle lease liabilities and derive benefit from rent negotiations and rent abatement resolutions; merchandise margins deleveraged 210 basis points driven by 300 basis points of higher shipping costs associated with increased online sales and carrier surcharges, offset by higher product margin due to lower promotional activities despite increases in airfreight costs; air costs were incurred in the quarter to navigate the port delays that mounted because of COVID-imposed restrictions. 
Turning to SG&A. Fourth quarter operating expenses were $1.5 billion and 34.7% of sales, leveraging 640 basis points versus last year. Recall that last year had $501 million in onetime SG&A costs primarily related to flagship impairments as well as costs for previously planned separation from Old Navy. We have initiated a strategic review of our Intermix business as we reshape the profitability of our portfolio of brands. As a result, fourth quarter operating expenses include a $56 million trademark and long-term asset impairment charge related to the Intermix business. Excluding this impairment charge, on an adjusted basis, fourth quarter total operating expenses were 33.4% of sales, in line with our previous guidance for SG&A for the quarter of 33% to 34% of sales. When normalizing for the intermix impairment this year and the flagship impairment charges last year, fourth quarter SG&A dollars increased $60 million versus last year. Notably, store expense savings largely offset the investment in demand generation with nominal increase in expenses over last year being mostly driven by real estate termination fees and higher distribution center costs. 
Consistent with our strategy, we generated store expense savings of approximately $133 million related to store closures and productivity efforts, partially offset by $40 million in higher health and safety costs to keep our employees and customers safe. These safety costs are likely to stay with us for the first half of 2021, but we are closely monitoring vaccination progress and infection rates, and we'll continue to invest in the safety of our customers and employees as long as necessary. 
We invested in marketing as we pursue market share growth during this highly disrupted time in the apparel market. Marketing dollars were up $66 million year-over-year and deleveraged 150 basis points. As a result, Gap Inc. gained 0.7 points in market share in Q4, ending the quarter at 6% of total U.S. market share for the company. And we grew our customer file to 183 million global known customers. 
We incurred $19 million of costs in the quarter associated with strategic store closures. Although from an earnings standpoint, these costs were essentially offsetting gross margin through lower rent and occupancy. 
Turning to EBIT on a reported basis, fourth quarter operating income totaled $134 million. Operating margin of 3% leveraged 820 basis points versus last year's reported operating margin due to the material year ago flagship store impairments and costs associated with the previously planned Old Navy separation. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income totaled $190 million with operating margin of 4.3%. 
Moving to taxes and interest. The effective tax rate was negative 204% for the quarter. Taxes were highly favorable in the quarter, reflecting changes in the estimated benefit associated with the enactment of the CARES Act and the impact of the nonrecurring income tax benefit related to legal entity structure changes. These tax items in the quarter delivered an EPS benefit of approximately $0.45. For the year, the effective tax rate was 40%, and fourth quarter net interest expense was $57 million. 
Turning to EPS for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter reported earnings per share was $0.61 versus a loss of $0.49 in the prior year, including a current year benefit of approximately $0.45 from nonrecurring tax items and approximately $0.12 in charges related to the impairment of the Intermix business as a result of the strategic review. 
Now let me provide some perspective on inventory. Total inventory was up 14% versus fourth quarter of last year. Despite the higher year-over-year inventory, markdown inventory is below last year, and we're pleased with the current inventory composition. We are confident that first half assortments and the quality of the inventory composition will enable product margins in the first half of 2021 to be above last year's levels. 
There were 3 main drivers of the year-over-year increase, with the first 2 associated with the timing of inventory ownership. First, about 10 percentage points of the increase resulted from inventory the company strategically held back in the first half of fiscal year 2020 due to COVID-related store closures that will be reintroduced for sale during the first half of fiscal year 2021. While this does drive a temporary increase in our inventory balance, it was contemplated in our first half receipt plans, which were adjusted accordingly. Second, new COVID-related U.S. port congestion and impacts on shipping lanes were unforeseen and contributed to higher year-over-year in-transit inventory levels. And third, we continue to sell COVID-related safety products such as masks and hand sanitizers in the near-term and owned this new category of inventory at year-end. We also ended the year with inventory levels above our prior guidance. In addition to the impact from port congestion, the second driver of this increase is from longer living seasonless styles and basics that we purposely held at shallow promotions within Q4 to improve product margins while we balance deeper discounts on seasonally reliable products. While this did increase our year-end inventory levels of nonliable and basic products, we will leverage our responsive supply chain to adjust replenishment within the first half of fiscal year '21 and believe this strategy will enable us to maximize gross margin over the life of these products. 
Looking forward, we expect inventory levels to decrease as we reach the end of the first half and to end Q2 with inventory up high single digits. This inventory outlook includes the expectation of continued port delays causing higher in-transit balances as well as set up inventory to support the Q3 launch of Old Navy Plus product, a strategic growth initiative the brand is proud to launch. 
Moving to real estate and store closures. Regarding our previously announced real estate restructure program, our discussions with landlords have progressed quite well, and we are making quick and effective progress on our real estate goals. During the year, we closed 228 Gap and Banana stores globally, in line with our guidance of 225. 
In fiscal 2020, we incurred cash outlays of about $75 million related to closures. In 2021, we expect to meet our closure target of 75 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America and estimate net cash outlays of about $135 million. We are still targeting to close about 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023, and we continue to expect total cash outlays of the program as shared during our October investor meeting to be about $210 million. 
For the full program, as of the end of 2023, we continue to expect annualized pretax savings of about $100 million. This estimate does not include our strategic review of our Europe market. 
Fiscal 2020 capital expenditures were $392 million, below our normal levels of investment as we responded to the pandemic impact on cash flows. Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, fiscal year 2020 free cash flow was negative $155 million compared with positive $709 million last year. Notably, following the challenges of the COVID pandemic earlier in the year, free cash flow during the last 3 quarters of the year was approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. We are committed to the uses of cash we laid out at our Investor Day: number one, invest in growth through capital expenditures; number two, return cash to shareholders, largely through a competitive dividend; and number three, evaluate how we use excess cash to delever over time. In light of the continued pandemic uncertainty, we remain prudent in our approach to cash management with a balance between return of capital to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility to invest in the business. And our ending share count was 374 million shares. 
So before I turn it over to Sonia, let me touch on our financial outlook for 2021. While the biggest impact from the pandemic is likely largely behind us, we expect the lingering impacts as seen in the fourth quarter of international market closures and stay-at-home restrictions including in Canada, China, Japan and Europe as well as U.S. COVID case counts to persist, particularly in the first half of 2021. However, as vaccines roll out and stimulus checks begin, we currently view the second half of 2021 favorably, reflecting a likely return to a more normalized prepandemic level. With that in mind, I would like to provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2021. Excluding costs associated with strategic reviews we are conducting in Europe or with our Intermix business, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.35. 
Now let me provide you with some additional guidance metrics for 2021. We anticipate full year net sales growth to be in the range of mid- to high teens versus fiscal year 2020. We expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 5% in 2021. The  outlook for 2021 is consistent with the company's Power Plan 2023 objective of achieving at least 10% EBIT margin by the end of 2023. We expect to open 30 to 40 Old Navy stores and 20 to 30 Athleta stores. And consistent with our strategy, we plan to close approximately 100 Gap and Banana Republic stores globally, including 75 closures in North America. This will put us at 75% of our targeted North America closures by the end of fiscal '21. We expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 25%. 
Our reliable cash generation and balance sheet remains strong. As we look to 2021, our capital allocation philosophy and priorities remain consistent. First and foremost, we plan to invest adequately but responsibility -- responsibly in the business to drive growth. With that, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be about $800 million. 
We will shift our capital spend to higher ROIC projects as we distort our investments towards higher returning customer-facing growth initiatives such as digital, customer acquisition programs like loyalty, DC capacity to accommodate online growth and store growth for Old Navy and Athleta. Second, we remain committed to returning to paying a dividend. With that, we will pay the previously declared and deferred Q1 fiscal '20 dividend of just over $0.24 per share in Q1 of fiscal '21. In addition, the company expects to initiate a new dividend in Q2 of 2021 at a level that balances the return of capital to shareholders with the financial flexibility to face continued uncertainty and invest in growth. 
In light of the current uncertainty related to the pandemic recovery, we do not anticipate share repurchases in the first half of 2021. We believe this outlook reflects the company's progress even amidst a challenging 2020 and as we transition to a strong 2021. And most importantly, is consistent with the strategic objectives and long-term goals we shared with you during our October investor meeting including improving our cost structure, particularly through store fleet rationalization, strongly supporting the growth of our brands and returning cash to shareholders. 
Looking forward, we remain on track to delivering our 2023 EBIT margin target of about 10%. Our progress in 2020 and our guidance for 2021 continued to provide important milestones of progress on our journey towards that goal. Continued improvements beyond 2021 will be accomplished by progressing the following initiatives: one, completing our North America store closure plan; two, sunsetting COVID costs such as health and safety; three, completing strategic reviews of select international markets and domestic businesses; four, making meaningful progress on engineering fixed operating costs; five, launching sourcing logic and inventory initiatives targeted at growing gross margins as we look to defray growing pressures from the continued shift into online; and six, leveraging increases in marketing from 2020 and 2021 we made to proactively gain share. 
And so with that, I will turn the call over to Sonia."

And alongside our employees, our customers, our communities",2297,"Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we look ahead, I want to take a minute to reflect on 2020. COVID-19 presented the biggest crisis our company our industry has ever faced. And alongside our employees, our customers, our communities and the rest of the world, we faced challenges that defined a new path for every one of us. 
It's also true that every crisis is an opportunity, and this one met Gap Inc. at a crucial pivot point. We used this opportunity to lead with our competitive advantages, while embracing the values this company was founded on to emerge in a place of strength and with a clear path forward. 
Our teams showed resiliency and the ability to try fast, learn fast and think big to meet customers' needs. First, we gained meaningful market share quarter-over-quarter by investing in growth across our purpose-led brands during this period of market dislocation. We grew our global known customer file by 14% in 2020 to over 183 million and introduced convenient new ways for them to shop with us by expanding our buy online, pick up in store capabilities to curbside pickup, and launching new payment methods like Afterpay and introducing our loyalty program. 
Our online business reached over $6 billion in sales and delivered 54% annual sales growth leveraging our powerful omnichannel platform. Following the shutdown, we reopened our fleet of more than 3,000 stores quickly while permanently closing a group of over 20 -- 200 unprofitable stores as part of our fleet rationalization strategy. 
With the increased casualization of style, we played into our product category strength with disproportionate sales coming from Active and Fleece, Sleep and kids and baby. We also quickly pivoted to produce masks, a new top category, which represented 3% of sales in 2020 and drove new customer growth. We met our customers' e-commerce shipping expectations at scale with on-time delivery of approximately 130 million products, well above the industry average. 
And finally, we helped develop the gold standard in health and safety practices, allowing employees and customers to feel confident working and shopping in our stores. 
Now as we turn the page to 2021, we're pleased with the traction we're seeing in the business. However, we understand retail is fully volatile. And that we will continue to face challenges that we will remain agile in the face of. 
I recently had the honor to speak with President Biden, Vice President Harris and other members of the new administration, alongside several other CEOs. I represented our business and broader industry, discussing the urgent actions required to recover from this crisis and rebuild an equitable and inclusive economy. And while uncertainty remains, I'm confident in our ability to Gap Inc.'s speed and flexibility and does all that will serve us well. Through it all, we understand this is a long game. And are squarely focused on executing against our Power Plan 2023 and delivering profitable growth in 2021. 
Let me walk you through how our brand strategy will show up this year, starting with the power of our brands. Each of our brands are poised to deliver growth through world-class branding, relevant product and unbeatable experiences that will inspire our customers to become loyalists. Each with a distinct point of view, deeply rooted in value. 
Let me first talk about Old Navy. Old Navy's results were very strong in Q4, driving 5% sales growth year-over-year while also delivering margin expansion. According to NPV Group, Old Navy has made continuous market share gains each quarter year-to-date on a trailing 12-month basis. The brand's strong value proposition, leadership in key categories like Active and Fleece and kids and baby and commitment to leading with values has allowed Old Navy to win in today's dislocated market, and they will lean on these strengths moving forward. The future looks bright for Old Navy, and we're confident in their ability to grow to $10 billion over the next 3 years. This year, Old Navy will deliver on the democracy of style through its commitment to inclusivity and the rollout of Plus to the entire store fleet later this year. They will focus on democratizing service through a differentiated experience powered by new and highly scaled omnicapabilities, as well as their Navyist loyalty program that will accelerate value creation for both our customers and for our business. 
Next, Gap. Gap stands for modern American optimism, and we have seen customers respond well over the last year to a more consistent point of view as we've leaned into relevant product and culture-defining conversations and creative. We are positioning Gap to win for the long term by creating a profitable store fleet, a shift to digital and by delivering effortless style and quality and market share gaining categories and partnering to amplify brand reach. This transformation is well underway, and we're excited to build upon it this year. 
The #1 question mark gets asked and I, as well is about our Yeezy Gap partnership. We are on track to launch in the first half of this year, and I'm impressed with how the team is unleashing their creativity and innovation in both the development of the product and the experience for the customer. We cannot wait to share it with you. Additionally, we're excited about the licensing work underway with IMG and are set to deliver new categories like Gap Home and Baby Gap gear later this year. 
Moving to Banana Republic. Since the appointment of Sandra Stangl as Head of Banana Republic in December, the team is moving fast to position the brand for health by redefining affordable luxury and building a road map for growth that meets customer needs today and in the future. We're excited to see how this comes to life later this year. 
In January, we launched BR Standard, a collection of luxe performance wear and elevated essentials for every day, more in line with current customer trends as well as creative repositioning in February that is beautiful and right for brand. The team is also highly focused on the store experience, from transforming allocation of inventory to better align with our customer, improving digital merchandising and transforming our field culture from operational to one of style and service. 
And finally, Athleta. With 29% sales growth in Q4, yes, 29%, we have never been more confident in Athleta's path forward and its ability to reach $2 billion by 2023. Athleta is our highest margin business, and like Old Navy, has made continuous market share gains each quarter year-to-date. The brand's position in the growing active category and its powerful mission to support confident women and girls gives the team permission to grow in multiple directions. Across product categories, digital and physical locations, internationally and through distributed commerce by leveraging the power of our platform and portfolio. 
Athleta had 2 exciting product launches in January. First, they brought Freeport to the market using a rapid customer-centric product innovation approach that they will apply to other opportunities going forward. This will develop with the customer at the center. 
Next, to bring life to its mission of inclusivity, Athleta announced the expansion into inclusive sizing. For spring 2021, 70% of the athletic collection will be available in sizes 1x to 3x now. As part of this, Athleta launched a new holistic brand campaign entitled All Powerful, a multi-platform celebration of the beauty and power in all women. We believe both of these product expansions will be major growth drivers in 2021. 
Our vision is to grow our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands. And as Katrina mentioned earlier, in line with our strategy, we have performed a strategic review of our Intermix business. This move allows us to prioritize our strategic focus and resources behind the brands with the most potential and that generate the most sales and profit. 
Next, the power of our portfolio. Together, our brands have huge reach, targeting approximately 80% of the $200 billion addressable apparel market. The power of our portfolio is extending that reach to new customers. Each brand playing their part too through creative differentiation, pricing segmentation and product expansions like teen, plus and sleep. It's also leveraging the brand's collective power to make big product bets like we did last year with mask. 
We're also using that collective power to grow our customer file. I'm so excited about this. We've welcomed new customers and are building stronger relationships with the ones we have. As I've said before, it is our goal to turn every customer into a loyalist. We launched our Navyist, Gap Good, Banana Republic and Athleta Rewards at the end of September. And in Q4 alone, enrolled 6.4 million new loyalists across the company into the program. 
One of the biggest value drivers for us in 2021 will be the full implementation and integration of our loyalty program across all of our brands this summer. We know members of our loyalty program outspend nonloyalty customers by more than 80%. And this integrated program will offer our loyalists, benefits across our entire portfolio, while still providing unique and emotional brand connections. If we can get a customer from a single transaction to multiple transactions to multiple channels and to multiple brands, we see value accretion at every step. 
Another focus across the portfolio is the profitability of our store fleet. We are on track with our fleet restructuring efforts across Gap and Banana Republic, while we're opening stores across Old Navy and Athleta to fuel growth. Additionally, we are moving forward with the strategic review of our Europe business, and we'll have more to share later this year. 
Finally, the power of our platform. Powering our brands is the strength of our platform and capabilities at scale. At #2 in the U.S. apparel e-commerce sales of $6 billion, we believe Gap Inc. is uniquely advantaged to win in digital. Our online business grew 54% in 2020 and closed the year at about 45% of total company sales. 
To meet the rising demand of online shopping and our target of increasing digital penetration to 50% by 2023, we're focused on personalization at scale and enhancing capabilities across mobile, all supported by a highly automated fulfillment network. 
Mobile has become our customers' preferred way to shop with us online, and we know it can deliver further degrees of personalization and inspiration as well as enable the entire omnishopping journey. We now have over 50% of traffic and 75% of sales annually through mobile. 
With mobile as the primary engagement platform, we're working quickly to create frictionless mobile shopping and new digital experiences as devices, network and customer preferences evolve. Fueling the growth of our online business is our investment in distribution center capacity. Last month, we announced plans to open a new state of the art DC in Texas to support Old Navy's growing online business. By delivering inventory faster and more efficiently to customers across the country, this new campus will allow us to meet the rising customer demand for online shopping. 
Key elements of our Power Plan will also take shape in our thousands of stores by making customer-facing improvements that will also help us reduce store operating costs. We will apply automation to key customer touch points that will enable greater levels of service and engagement with our shoppers, including exploring the introduction of self-checkout later this year. We will begin work on optimizing our store operating model, starting with Old Navy by leaning on lessons and talent from our distribution centers. 
Through store closures, strategic reviews and our focus on reducing fixed operating costs, we are building a virtuous cycle where productivity can fuel demand generation. Pointedly, our investments in technology and marketing. As Katrina mentioned, we are making progress against SG&A, and our effort to systemize and digitize our operations will be the rocket fuel for growth across our brands. 
As America's largest clothing company with reach around the world and a collection of purpose-led lifestyle brand, we're proud to create product experiences our customers love while doing right by our employees, communities and planet. We are led by our purpose, inclusive by design. And in the coming year, are steadfast in delivering on our commitments to racial equality and increasing representation at all levels of the company. 
We fundamentally believe the diversity of experience, thought and perspective increases creativity and innovation, promote high-quality decisions and enhances business growth, not to mention a deeper reflection of our customers. Today, we announced that Salaam Coleman Smith has been elected to serve on the Gap Inc. Board of Directors. Salaam is a proven creator and innovator, bringing more than 20 years of leadership experience from top brands in entertainment including Walt Disney Company, Comcast NBCUniversal and Viacom. She has the perfect blend of art and science, balancing creative vision with strong business insight. Salaam connects deeply to Gap Inc.'s values having hired and led one of the most diverse and inclusive management teams in her industry. We look forward to her energy, guidance and leadership as we work to serve and represent the voices and interest of millions of customers. 
Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to thank the team. A year ago, I was asked to lead this incredible company, and I could not be prouder of what our nearly 120,000 employees along with the 2 million around the world in our value chain have accomplished together. This year allowed us to unleash our potential, and we're ready to deliver the next phase of work ahead. Through the power of our brands, our portfolio and our platform, we are ready to deliver profitable growth, value for our shareholders and the future we can all be proud of. 
With that, I will open it up for questions."

It's been a strong response to the product offering through 2020. And we think we've distorted into the winning categories with excellent execution. And we're investing in digital and traditional marketing with more to come. Strong active business, so maybe seen phenomenal growth there, and we're very well positioned to meet the rising demand for active and casual products over last year. 
And kids and baby, another very bright spot for the brand as the Old Navy achieved the rank of #1 the kids baby brand in the segment. And this is a particularly distressed sector outside of our business, and so we are consolidating market share aggressively here. 
The brand has evolved their product offering, and we expect to launch of synthesizing across the assortment this later this year. The test results have been really positive. So proud of the work that the team is doing to give our customers what they're asking for and confident in the sustained momentum against our Power Plan 2023.

I mean, what I would add is a couple of things. So as Sonia said, they're advantaged in their value space and with their democracy of style, positioning and then their creative execution has been excellent, and they offer the products customers want like active and kids and baby. And then as we look forward, we are launching the Plus business in the back half of this year, which we think is really squarely appropriate for acquiring new customers and servicing better the existing customers and also the loyalty capability that we look to launch in the back half of the year as we look forward to driving more lifetime value with a multi-tender loyalty customer. 
And then to add to your question about margins, I would say the right product with a relevant brand and strong execution has allowed the team to really pull back on promotions. And use the strength of the brand and the marketing to drive the sell-through on the inventory. And structurally, we feel like there's nothing really holding them back from continuing to deliver that. And then I think you heard Sonia say in her prepared remarks, we're also looking at the store productivity as it relates to self-checkout and other mechanisms where we can start driving more productivity in stores. 
So I guess, all to say, we have great confidence in how Old Navy has executed and what the future holds for them this year and beyond."

If you think about just at the highest level, a model change on Europe.

But importantly, the SG&A, the rent and occupancy and really the cost of operating that business will be meaningfully less. And so they should have a profit impact that is favorable to the company.

There's all the momentum that Sonia spoke to as far as the underlying health in our brands, the incremental growth that we're getting from our file, the margin momentum we're seeing, but we're also still navigating COVID, and we said in our prepared remarks that the front half of the year likely have some of that still in it. Whereas, the back half will return to the prepandemic levels. So I'll let you sort of model Q1 and Q2 based on that. But overwhelmingly feeling like so far, so good.

Certainly, at the bottom of the funnel, our digital marketing investments we manage by the hour, by the day, by the week and have a lot of fluidity in being able to turn that on and off based on return on that investment. And at the top of the funnel, in terms of brand affinity and brand building, we've been really pleased with the creative clarity that we're seeing from our brands and the values-based marketing has given us some of the highest ad spots that we've seen in the history of the company this past year. So that combination and the momentum that we're building creatively, the talent that we're adding to the teams and unleashing the full creative potential of our team is giving me more and more confidence that leaning into marketing in the time of dislocated disruption is even more critical than ever as we look to consolidate market share from a position of strength."

I think, as you said, we said our markdown inventory was below last year, heading into the year. The teams did an incredible job of really balancing the choices that they made around pricing to get higher AURs, lower markdown inventory levels and then are highly focused on maximizing the margin on the inventory we have in the front half of the year. I'm not going to comment specifically as it relates to 2019, but certainly, our aspirations as a company is to continue to build momentum through relevance in our brands and better product to drive incrementally better margins year-over-year, especially as we look to offset some of the structural changes that happen in the business when you shift into online.

So listen, a 1% North America comp in Q4 is -- that reflects the positive momentum in the brand. And they've done so much hard work this year, restructuring their unprofitable fleet segments of it, while investing in their stores. I mean, we refreshed 70 of our go-forward stores. We intend to get to the rest by mid-year. And I was in a store in New Jersey recently, and the customer stopped in her tracks and said, ""This is light, bright and happy."" I mean, what's a better statement than that for -- to hear from our customers. We're seeing a really nice pickup in Net Promoter Score as a result of our refreshed plan. 
So the restructure of the stores, the improvement of the go-forward fleet, the leaning out of the SG&A, and this is a lean, mean effective team now that is wired and has a culture oriented to winning. They're attracting new customers, their team launch, for example, there are -- is now representing about 17% of the kids business. And they're centered grounded in sustainable product offerings. So really pleased to see their overall discounting reduced. 
And then the partnership. Partnerships are important part of the future of the brand. We have a big launch coming up with Yeezy Gap. And I spoke to Yeezy last night, he's very, very focused on  this incredible opportunity. We're both very excited about it. And he and Mark and the entire Gap team are heads down and believe this to be a very big potential for us and look forward to sharing more with you as we launch in the first half. 
And then our licensing program, that plan that we signed last year, we expect some big launches in multi categories across lifestyle coming up here, later part of this year. So lots of levers to drive the momentum in Gap while dealing with the structural issues that have plagued the brand. And what makes me the happiest, honestly, is to see the fact that the brand is trending. It's trending with the younger customers. It's trending on TikTok. The new spring launch is incredibly relevant, and we're seeing massive impressions, whether it was Kornacki's Khakis during the election or what we're seeing today, the brand is back in the conversation at the zeitgeist of culture where it belongs. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to deliver excellent execution with discipline every day to live up to the promise of that brand's potential."

As we had said in our investor event, 2020 was COVID, 2021 is a return to profitable sales growth. But we do -- we have said that the first half still contemplates some of the COVID-related impacts. And so whether that's a little bit of weight on the sales driven by store traffic or market closures, whether it's health and safety costs. And the airfreight that we need to get around the port or whatever it is, there are incremental costs still in that 5% that are associated with having to navigate the pandemic. 
So as we pivot to getting out of the pandemic, one of the levers we'll have is to sunset those, as I talked about. And then as you said, some of the levers in our favor in the year are really reaping the benefits of the store closures as well as some of the productivity initiatives we've already put in place and some of the impact of moving towards the Old Navy and Athleta operating margin -- higher operating margin brands. 
And then to come, honestly, is a lot of the work we're going to do around partnering markets as well as really leaning into, as I said in my prepared remarks, really reengineering the fixed operating costs in the business more systematically through digitizing operations as well as some of the margin initiatives like inventory management and such that we think will start to help offset the impact of shifting to online. So more to come on that, but the 5%, again, is very much on the path that we expected. And still, unfortunately, have some of the COVID-related costs in it."

I want to share comments regarding the fourth quarter of the year, but more importantly, provide our 2021 financial outlook, as noted in our earnings release today. Following my comments, Sonia will then share her perspective, followed by Q&A.
We're very pleased with our progress on our path to our sustainable economic model, which I outlined at our Investor Day in October. Let's talk first about some key accomplishments from 2020 that put us well on our path to achieving our Power Plan 2023.
First, we remain very pleased with the performance of Old Navy and Athleta, which grew 5% and 29%, respectively, in Q4. Old Navy gained share to become the #2 apparel brand in the U.S., second to Nike. And Athleta surpassed $1 billion in sales and grew 16% for the full year despite the pandemic. Combined, they represented 63% of company sales in 2020, on the way to our target of 70% by the end of 2023. Their standout sales performance reflected gains in market share during the fourth quarter, led by their brand strength, omnichannel offerings and relevant product categories. Sonia will talk more about how they compete to win a bit later. 
There is meaningful progress in Gap brand. While total sales for Gap Brand Global were down in Q4, significantly impacted by pandemic-related market closures and restrictions in international markets, Gap North America delivered a 1% comp. This underscores the progress the brand is making in the product and operations of its core business.
We're pleased to have new leadership at Banana Republic. Sandra Stangl and her team will be focused on repositioning Banana Republic for a post-COVID world with relevant marketing and product.
We are becoming digitally dominant. Our online business grew 54% in 2020 and closed the year at about 45% of total company sales, up from 25% at the end of last year. At over $6 billion, our online channel is ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales, and when leveraged with our well-located fleet, is a strategic advantage in serving our customers through the omnichannel lens.
Our fleet rationalization is on track and driving significant economic value. In 2020, we closed 228 net Gap and Banana Republic stores globally, ahead of our 225-store closure target. These closures, along with lease negotiations and rent abatement settlements as well as higher online sales, contributed to over 400 basis points of ROD leverage in Q4.
We are progressing on our goal of improving the profitability of Gap brand as we partner to amplify through asset-light models. The YEEZY partnership is on track for launch in the latter part of the first half of 2021, and we continue to be excited by the creativity that partnership will bring to the brand. Our strategic review of Europe market is underway, and we are in process on several licensing deals that we believe will provide great extensions to the brand. 
We have driven meaningful improvements in product margins with good pricing discipline. And while freight and shipping costs as well as pandemic headwinds have persisted, this margin expansion has provided a partial offset against these rising costs. 
Several expense levers, strategic store closures and a reduction in force early in the year helped us weather pandemic-related costs this year such as meaningful health and safety costs and allowed us to lean into demand-generating investments such as marketing. Marketing has been a strategic investment this year as we leverage this dislocated apparel market to gain market share. 
We've undertaken a strategic review of our Intermix business as we continue to focus on our 4 $1 billion brands to drive a more profitable portfolio. And we have generated meaningful free cash flow in the quarter, ending the year with $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet will enable us to continue investing in growth in 2021 through capital expenditures while also returning to our long-standing practice of returning cash to shareholders through paying the previously approved dividend in the first quarter and initiating a new dividend in the second quarter. 
Recognizing the COVID-related challenges faced during 2020, I am very proud of our team and how we remain focused on driving these strategic initiatives to drive long-term shareholder value. 
As we look to 2021, despite the significant uncertainty that remains related to the COVID pandemic, we are pleased to provide a 2021 outlook today. For 2021, we expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.35. I will provide more context regarding this range in a moment, but it's important to note that the 2021 guidance range we are providing today was fully contemplated in our Power Plan 2023 and in the 2023 estimated 10% operating margin target we provided in our October investor event.
So let me move on to a recap of fourth quarter results, starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter were $4.4 billion, down 5% to last year and below our previous outlook. Fourth quarter sales were impacted by a mid-quarter resurgence in the COVID pandemic that resulted in unplanned mandated store closures and restrictions across Canada, Japan, China and Europe as well as new U.S. stay-at-home orders in select densely populated regions such as California and the Northeast, which impacted store traffic. 
The pandemic-related impact to fourth quarter sales is estimated to be approximately 4 percentage points. In addition, the sales decline related to strategically planned permanent store closures had an estimated impact of about 5 percentage points.
Overall, store sales in Q4 were down 28% as a result of slower traffic in select U.S. markets, COVID-related closures and the strategic closures related to the company's store rationalization initiative. Online sales grew 49% and contributed 46% of the sales in the quarter. We leveraged our omnichannel capabilities such as BOPIS and Ship from Store to serve the customer even as the pandemic surged. Comparable sales were flat in the quarter. Comp sales by brand are in our earnings press release.
Turning to gross margin. On a reported basis, fourth quarter gross profit totaled $1.7 billion, and gross margin rate was 37.7%, nearly 200 basis points ahead of both last year and the guidance we provided last quarter. Our year-over-year margin expansion is as follows. ROD leveraged 400 basis points from rent and occupancy savings as online sales increased and as we continue to close unprofitable stores, favorably settle lease liabilities and derive benefit from rent negotiations and rent abatement resolutions. Merchandise margins deleveraged 210 basis points, driven by 300 basis points of higher shipping costs associated with increased online sales and carrier surcharges, offset by higher product margin due to lower promotional activities despite increases in airfreight costs. Air costs were incurred in the quarter to navigate the port delays that mounted because of COVID-imposed restrictions.
Turning to SG&A. Fourth quarter operating expenses were $1.5 billion and 34.7% of sales, leveraging 640 basis points versus last year. Recall that last year had $501 million in onetime SG&A costs primarily related to flagship impairments as well as costs for previously planned separation from Old Navy. We have initiated a strategic review of our Intermix business as we reshape the profitability of our portfolio of brands. As a result, fourth quarter operating expenses include a $56 million trademark and long-term asset impairment charge related to the Intermix business. Excluding this impairment charge, on an adjusted basis, fourth quarter total operating expenses were 33.4% of sales, in line with our previous guidance for SG&A for the quarter of 33% to 34% of sales. When normalizing for the Intermix impairment this year and the flagship impairment charges last year, fourth quarter SG&A dollars increased $60 million versus last year. 
Notably, store expense savings largely offset the investment in demand generation with nominal increase in expenses over last year being mostly driven by real estate termination fees and higher distribution center costs. Consistent with our strategy, we generated store expense savings of approximately $133 million related to store closures and productivity efforts, partially offset by $40 million in higher health and safety costs to keep our employees and customers safe. These safety costs are likely to stay with us for the first half of 2021, but we are closely monitoring vaccination progress and infection rates, and we'll continue to invest in the safety of our customers and employees as long as necessary.
We invested in marketing as we pursue market share growth during this highly disrupted time in the apparel market. Marketing dollars were up $66 million year-over-year and deleveraged 150 basis points. As a result, Gap Inc. gained 0.7 points in market share in Q4, ending the quarter at 6% of total U.S. market share for the company. And we grew our customer file to 183 million global known customers.
We incurred $19 million of costs in the quarter associated with strategic store closures, although from an earnings standpoint, these costs were essentially offset in gross margin through lower rent and occupancy. 
Turning to EBIT on a reported basis. Fourth quarter operating income totaled $134 million. Operating margin of 3% leveraged 820 basis points versus last year's reported operating margin due to the material year ago flagship store impairments and costs associated with the previously planned Old Navy separation. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income totaled $190 million with operating margin of 4.3%.
Moving to taxes and interest. The effective tax rate was negative 204% for the quarter. Taxes were highly favorable in the quarter, reflecting changes in the estimated benefit associated with the enactment of the CARES Act and the impact of the nonrecurring income tax benefit related to legal entity structure changes. These tax items in the quarter delivered an EPS benefit of approximately $0.45. For the year, the effective tax rate was 40%, and fourth quarter net interest expense was $57 million.
Turning to EPS for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter reported earnings per share was $0.61 versus a loss of $0.49 in the prior year, including a current year benefit of approximately $0.45 from nonrecurring tax items and approximately $0.12 in charges related to the impairment of the Intermix business as a result of the strategic review. 
Now let me provide some perspective on inventory. Total inventory was up 14% versus fourth quarter of last year. Despite the higher year-over-year inventory, markdown inventory is below last year, and we're pleased with the current inventory composition. We are confident that first half assortments and the quality of the inventory composition will enable product margins in the first half of 2021 to be above last year's levels.
There were 3 main drivers of the year-over-year increase, with the first 2 associated with the timing of inventory ownership. First, about 10 percentage points of the increase resulted from inventory the company strategically held back in the first half of fiscal year 2020 due to COVID-related store closures that will be reintroduced for sale during the first half of fiscal year 2021. While this does drive a temporary increase in our inventory balance, it was contemplated in our first half receipt plans, which were adjusted accordingly. Second, new COVID-related U.S. port congestion and impacts on shipping lanes were unforeseen and contributed to higher year-over-year in-transit inventory levels. And third, we continue to sell COVID-related safety products such as masks and hand sanitizers in the near term and owned this new category of inventory at year-end. We also ended the year with inventory levels above our prior guidance.
In addition to the impact from port congestion, the second driver of this increase is from longer living seasonless styles and basics that we purposely held at shallow promotions within Q4 to improve product margins while we balance deeper discounts on seasonally liable products. While this did increase our year-end inventory levels of nonliable and basic products, we will leverage our responsive supply chain to adjust replenishment within the first half of fiscal year '21 and believe this strategy will enable us to maximize gross margin over the life of these products.
Looking forward, we expect inventory levels to decrease as we reach the end of the first half and to end Q2 with inventory up high single digits. This inventory outlook includes the expectation of continued port delays causing higher in-transit balances as well as set up inventory to support the Q3 launch of Old Navy Plus product, a strategic growth initiative the brand is proud to launch.
Moving to real estate and store closures. Regarding our previously announced real estate restructure program, our discussions with landlords have progressed quite well, and we are making quick and effective progress on our real estate goals. During the year, we closed 228 Gap and Banana stores globally, in line with our guidance of 225.
In fiscal 2020, we incurred cash outlays of about $75 million related to closures. In 2021, we expect to meet our closure target of 75 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America and estimate net cash outlays of about $135 million. We are still targeting to close about 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023, and we continue to expect total cash outlays of the program, as shared during our October Investor Meeting, to be about $210 million.
For the full program, as of the end of 2023, we continue to expect annualized pretax savings of about $100 million. This estimate does not include our strategic review of our Europe market. Fiscal 2020 capital expenditures were $392 million, below our normal levels of investment as we responded to the pandemic impact on cash flows. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, fiscal year 2020 free cash flow was negative $155 million compared with positive $709 million last year. Notably, following the challenges of the COVID pandemic earlier in the year, free cash flow during the last 3 quarters of the year was approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. 
We are committed to the uses of cash we laid out at our Investor Day: number one, invest in growth through capital expenditures; number two, return cash to shareholders, largely through a competitive dividend; and number three, evaluate how we use excess cash to delever over time. In light of the continued pandemic uncertainty, we remain prudent in our approach to cash management with a balance between return of capital to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility to invest in the business. And our ending share count was 374 million shares.
So before I turn it over to Sonia, let me touch on our financial outlook for 2021. While the biggest impact from the pandemic is likely largely behind us, we expect the lingering impacts as seen in the fourth quarter of international market closures and stay-at-home restrictions including in Canada, China, Japan and Europe as well as U.S. COVID case counts to persist, particularly in the first half of 2021. However, as vaccines roll out and stimulus checks begin, we currently view the second half of 2021 favorably, reflecting a likely return to a more normalized prepandemic level.
With that in mind, I would like to provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2021. Excluding costs associated with strategic reviews we are conducting in Europe or with our Intermix business, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.35.
Now let me provide you with some additional guidance metrics for 2021. We anticipate full year net sales growth to be in the range of mid- to high teens versus fiscal year 2020. We expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 5% in 2021. The outlook for 2021 is consistent with the company's Power Plan 2023 objective of achieving at least 10% EBIT margin by the end of 2023. 
We expect to open 30 to 40 Old Navy stores and 20 to 30 Athleta stores. And consistent with our strategy, we plan to close approximately 100 Gap and Banana Republic stores globally, including 75 closures in North America. This will put us at 75% of our targeted North America closures by the end of fiscal '21. We expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 25%.
Our reliable cash generation and balance sheet remains strong. As we look to 2021, our capital allocation philosophy and priorities remain consistent. First and foremost, we plan to invest adequately but responsibility -- responsibly in the business to drive growth. With that, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be about $800 million. We will shift our capital spend to higher ROIC projects as we distort our investments towards higher-returning customer-facing growth initiatives such as digital, customer acquisition programs like loyalty, DC capacity to accommodate online growth and store growth for Old Navy and Athleta. 
Second, we remain committed to returning to paying a dividend. With that, we will pay the previously declared and deferred Q1 fiscal '20 dividend of just over $0.24 per share in Q1 of fiscal '21. In addition, the company expects to initiate a new dividend in Q2 of 2021 at a level that balances the return of capital to shareholders with the financial flexibility to face continued uncertainty and invest in growth. In light of the current uncertainty related to the pandemic recovery, we do not anticipate share repurchases in the first half of 2021. 
We believe this outlook reflects the company's progress even amidst a challenging 2020 and as we transition to a strong 2021, and most importantly, is consistent with the strategic objectives and long-term goals we shared with you during our October Investor Meeting including improving our cost structure, particularly through store fleet rationalization, strongly supporting the growth of our brands and returning cash to shareholders.
Looking forward, we remain on track to delivering our 2023 EBIT margin target of about 10%. Our progress in 2020 and our guidance for 2021 continued to provide important milestones of progress on our journey towards that goal. Continued improvements beyond 2021 will be accomplished by progressing the following initiatives: one, completing our North America store closure plan; two, sunsetting COVID costs such as health and safety; three, completing strategic reviews of select international markets and domestic businesses; four, making meaningful progress on engineering fixed operating costs; five, launching sourcing logic and inventory initiatives targeted at growing gross margins as we look to defray growing pressures from the continued shift into online; and six, leveraging increases in marketing from 2020 and 2021 we made to proactively gain share.
And so with that, I will turn the call over to Sonia."

COVID-19 presented the biggest crisis our company -- our industry has ever faced. And alongside our employees, our customers, our communities and the rest of the world, we faced challenges that defined a new path for every one of us.
It's also true that every crisis is an opportunity, and this one met Gap Inc. at a crucial pivot point. We used this opportunity to lead with our competitive advantages while embracing the values this company was founded on to emerge in a place of strength and with a clear path forward. Our teams showed resiliency and the ability to try fast, learn fast and think big to meet customers' needs. 
First, we gained meaningful market share quarter-over-quarter by investing in growth across our purpose-led brands during this period of market dislocation. We grew our global known customer file by 14% in 2020 to over 183 million and introduced convenient new ways for them to shop with us by expanding our Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities to curbside pickup and launching new payment methods like Afterpay and introducing our loyalty program.
Our online business reached over $6 billion in sales and delivered 54% annual sales growth, leveraging our powerful omnichannel platform. Following the shutdown, we reopened our fleet of more than 3,000 stores quickly while permanently closing a group of over 20 -- 200 unprofitable stores as part of our fleet rationalization strategy.
With the increased casualization of style, we played into our product category strength with disproportionate sales coming from Active and Fleece and Kids and Baby. We also quickly pivoted to produce masks, a new top category, which represented 3% of sales in 2020 and drove new customer growth. We met our customers' e-commerce shipping expectations at scale with on-time delivery of approximately 130 million products, well above the industry average. And finally, we helped develop the gold standard in health and safety practices, allowing employees and customers to feel confident working and shopping in our stores.
Now as we turn the page to 2021, we're pleased with the traction we're seeing in the business. However, we understand retail is fully volatile and that we will continue to face challenges that we will remain agile in the face of.
I recently had the honor to speak with President Biden, Vice President Harris and other members of the new administration alongside several other CEOs. I represented our business and broader industry, discussing the urgent actions required to recover from this crisis and rebuild an equitable and inclusive economy. And while uncertainty remains, I'm confident in our agility, in Gap Inc.'s speed and flexibility and that all of that will serve us well. Through it all, we understand this is a long game and are squarely focused on executing against our Power Plan 2023 and delivering profitable growth in 2021.
Let me walk you through how our brand strategy will show up this year, starting with the power of our brands. Each of our brands are poised to deliver growth through world-class branding, relevant product and unbeatable experiences that will inspire our customers to become loyalists, each with a distinct point of view deeply rooted in value.
Let me first talk about Old Navy. Old Navy's results were very strong in Q4, driving 5% sales growth year-over-year while also delivering margin expansion. According to NPD Group, Old Navy has made continuous market share gains each quarter year-to-date on a trailing 12-month basis. The brand's strong value proposition, leadership in key categories like Active and Fleece and Kids and Baby and commitment to leading with values has allowed Old Navy to win in today's dislocated market, and they will lean on these strengths moving forward. 
The future looks bright for Old Navy, and we're confident in their ability to grow to $10 billion over the next 3 years. This year, Old Navy will deliver on the democracy of style through its commitment to inclusivity and the rollout of Plus to the entire store fleet later this year. They will focus on democratizing service through a differentiated experience powered by new and highly scaled omnicapabilities as well as their Navyist loyalty program that will accelerate value creation for both our customers and for our business.
Next, Gap. Gap stands for modern American optimism, and we have seen customers respond well over the last year to a more consistent point of view as we've leaned into relevant product and culture-defining conversations and creative. We are positioning Gap to win for the long term by creating a profitable store fleet, a shift to digital and by delivering effortless style and quality and market share gaining categories and partnering to amplify brand reach. This transformation is well underway, and we're excited to build upon it this year.
The #1 question mark gets asked, and I as well, is about our YEEZY Gap partnership. We are on track to launch in the first half of this year, and I'm impressed with how the team is unleashing their creativity and innovation in both the development of the product and the experience for the customer. We cannot wait to share it with you. Additionally, we're excited about the licensing work underway with IMG and are set to deliver new categories like Gap Home and Baby Gap Gear later this year.
Moving to Banana Republic. Since the appointment of Sandra Stangl as Head of Banana Republic in December, the team is moving fast to position the brand for health by redefining affordable luxury and building a road map for growth that meets customer needs today and in the future. We're excited to see how this comes to life later this year.
In January, we launched BR Standard, a collection of luxe performance wear and elevated essentials for every day, more in line with current customer trends, as well as creative repositioning in February that is beautiful and right for brand. The team is also highly focused on the store experience, from transforming allocation of inventory to better align with our customer, improving digital merchandising and transforming our field culture from operational to one of style and service.
And finally, Athleta. With 29% sales growth in Q4, yes, 29%, we have never been more confident in Athleta's path forward and its ability to reach $2 billion by 2023. Athleta is our highest margin business, and like Old Navy, has made continuous market share gains each quarter year-to-date. The brand's position in the growing active category and its powerful mission to support confident women and girls gives the team permission to grow in multiple directions: across product categories, digital and physical locations, internationally and through distributed commerce by leveraging the power of our platform and portfolio.
Athleta had 2 exciting product launches in January. First, they brought sleepwear to the market using a rapid customer-centric product innovation approach that they will apply to other opportunities going forward. This will develop with the customer at the center.
Next, to bring life to its mission of inclusivity, Athleta announced the expansion into inclusive sizing. For spring 2021, 70% of the Athleta collection will be available in sizes 1x to 3x now. As part of this, Athleta launched a new holistic brand campaign entitled All Powerful, a multi-platform celebration of the beauty and power in all women. We believe both of these product expansions will be major growth drivers in 2021.
Our vision is to grow our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands. And as Katrina mentioned earlier, in line with our strategy, we have performed a strategic review of our Intermix business. This move allows us to prioritize our strategic focus and resources behind the brands with the most potential and that generate the most sales and profit.
Next, the power of our portfolio. Together, our brands have huge reach, targeting approximately 80% of the $200 billion addressable apparel market. The power of our portfolio is extending that reach to new customers, each brand playing their part, too, through creative differentiation, pricing segmentation and product expansions like teen, plus and sleep. It's also leveraging the brand's collective power to make big product bets like we did last year with masks.
We're also using that collective power to grow our customer file. I'm so excited about this. We've welcomed new customers and are building stronger relationships with the ones we have. As I've said before, it is our goal to turn every customer into a loyalist. We launched our Navyist, Gap Good, Banana Republic and Athleta Rewards at the end of September, and in Q4 alone, enrolled 6.4 million new loyalists across the company into the program.
One of the biggest value drivers for us in 2021 will be the full implementation and integration of our loyalty program across all of our brands this summer. We know members of our loyalty program outspend nonloyalty customers by more than 80%. This integrated program will offer our loyalists, benefits across our entire portfolio while still providing unique and emotional brand connections. If we can get a customer from a single transaction to multiple transactions, to multiple channels and to multiple brands, we see value accretion at every step.
Another focus across the portfolio is the profitability of our store fleet. We are on track with our fleet restructuring efforts across Gap and Banana Republic, while we're opening stores across Old Navy and Athleta to fuel growth. Additionally, we are moving forward with the strategic review of our Europe business, and we'll have more to share later this year.
Finally, the power of our platform. Powering our brands is the strength of our platform and capabilities at scale. At #2 in the U.S. apparel e-commerce sales of $6 billion, we believe Gap Inc. is uniquely advantaged to win in digital. Our online business grew 54% in 2020 and closed the year at about 45% of total company sales. To meet the rising demand of online shopping and our target of increasing digital penetration to 50% by 2023, we're focused on personalization at scale and enhancing capabilities across mobile, all supported by a highly automated fulfillment network.
Mobile has become our customers' preferred way to shop with us online, and we know it can deliver further degrees of personalization and inspiration as well as enable the entire omnishopping journey. We now have over 50% of traffic and 75% of sales annually through mobile. With mobile as the primary engagement platform, we're working quickly to create frictionless mobile shopping and new digital experiences as devices, network and customer preferences evolve. 
Fueling the growth of our online business is our investment in distribution center capacity. Last month, we announced plans to open a new state-of-the-art DC in Texas to support Old Navy's growing online business. By delivering inventory faster and more efficiently to customers across the country, this new campus will allow us to meet the rising customer demand for online shopping.
Key elements of our Power Plan will also take shape in our thousands of stores by making customer-facing improvements that will also help us reduce store operating costs. We will apply automation to key customer touch points that will enable greater levels of service and engagement with our shoppers, including exploring the introduction of self-checkout later this year. We will begin work on optimizing our store operating model, starting with Old Navy, by leaning on lessons and talent from our distribution centers.
Through store closures, strategic reviews and our focus on reducing fixed operating costs, we are building a virtuous cycle where productivity can fuel demand generation, pointedly, our investments in technology and marketing. As Katrina mentioned, we are making progress against SG&A, and our effort to systemize and digitize our operations will be the rocket fuel for growth across our brands.
As America's largest clothing company with reach around the world and a collection of purpose-led lifestyle brand, we're proud to create product experiences our customers love while doing right by our employees, communities and planet. We are led by our purpose, inclusive by design, and in the coming year, are steadfast in delivering on our commitments to racial equality and increasing representation at all levels of the company. We fundamentally believe the diversity of experience, thought and perspective increases creativity and innovation, promotes high-quality decisions and enhances business growth, not to mention a deeper reflection of our customers. 
Today, we announced that Salaam Coleman Smith has been elected to serve on the Gap Inc. Board of Directors. Salaam is a proven creator and innovator, bringing more than 20 years of leadership experience from top brands in entertainment including Walt Disney Company, Comcast NBCUniversal and Viacom. She has the perfect blend of art and science, balancing creative vision with strong business insight. Salaam connects deeply to Gap Inc.'s values, having hired and led one of the most diverse and inclusive management teams in her industry. We look forward to her energy, guidance and leadership as we work to serve and represent the voices and interests of millions of customers.
Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to thank the team. A year ago, I was asked to lead this incredible company. And I could not be prouder of what our nearly 120,000 employees, along with the 2 million around the world in our value chain, have accomplished together. This year allowed us to unleash our potential, and we're ready to deliver the next phase of work ahead. Through the power of our brands, our portfolio and our platform, we are ready to deliver profitable growth, value for our shareholders and a future we can all be proud of.
With that, I will open it up for questions."

There's been a strong response to the product offering through 2020. And we think we've distorted into the winning categories with excellent execution. And we're investing in digital and traditional marketing with more to come. 
Strong active business, so maybe seen phenomenal growth there, and we're very well positioned to meet the rising demand for active and casual products over last year. And kids and baby, another very bright spot for the brand as the Old Navy achieved the rank of #1 in the kids and baby brand in the segment. And this is a particularly distressed sector outside of our business, and so we are consolidating market share aggressively here. 
The brand has evolved their product offering, and we expect to launch extended sizing across the assortment later this year. The test results have been really positive. So proud of the work that the team is doing to give our customers what they're asking for and confident in the sustained momentum against our Power Plan 2023. 
I don't know if you would like to build on that."

So as Sonia said, they're advantaged in their value space and with their democracy of style positioning. And then their creative execution has been excellent, and they offer the products customers want like active and kids and baby. And then as we look forward, we are launching the Plus business in the back half of this year, which we think is really squarely appropriate for acquiring new customers and servicing better the existing customers and also the loyalty capability that we look to launch in the back half of the year as we look forward to driving more lifetime value with a multi-tender loyalty customer. 
And then to add to your question about margins, I would say the right product with a relevant brand and strong execution has allowed the team to really pull back on promotions and use the strength of the brand and the marketing to drive the sell-through on the inventory. And structurally, we feel like there's nothing really holding them back from continuing to deliver that. 
And then I think you heard Sonia say in her prepared remarks, we're also looking at the store productivity as it relates to self-checkout and other mechanisms where we can start driving more productivity in stores. So I guess all to say we have great confidence in how Old Navy has executed and what the future holds for them this year and beyond."

And so when you think about the huge reach of Old Navy and the sheer customer file and personalization continuing to progress and having the ability to optimize on product, on price, et cetera, the need for the historical discounting or methods of driving the business are fading as we move into these more sophisticated and consistent capabilities. It's a big part of our capital investment this coming year.

And when we talk specifically about marketing and the investments, we do expect those investments to continue. We feel good about the effectiveness of those investments. 
I can talk about at the high end of the funnel, top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel. Certainly, at the bottom of the funnel, our digital marketing investments, we manage by the hour, by the day, by the week and have a lot of fluidity in being able to turn that on and off based on return on that investment. And at the top of the funnel, in terms of brand affinity and brand building, we've been really pleased with the creative clarity that we're seeing from our brands and the values-based marketing has given us some of the highest ad spots that we've seen in the history of the company this past year. 
So that combination and the momentum that we're building creatively, the talent that we're adding to the team and unleashing the full creative potential of our team is giving me more and more confidence that leaning into marketing in the time of dislocated disruption is even more critical than ever as we look to consolidate market share from a position of strength."

And certainly, we wish everything could be here exactly on time. But fundamentally, the teams have developed an amount of agility around navigating the assortment timing. And so they are watching closely the timing of when the receipts hit, getting those into the stores, and then if there is lateness, adjusting receipts on the back end. And so we feel quite good that there's no margin impact of the port issues. It's really more about the timing of getting things offloaded and over here. So that's that piece. 
I think as you said, we said our markdown inventory was below last year heading into the year. The teams did an incredible job of really balancing the choices that they made around pricing to get higher AURs, lower markdown inventory levels and then are highly focused on maximizing the margin on the inventory we have in the front half of the year. 
I'm not going to comment specifically as it relates to 2019, but certainly, our aspirations as a company is to continue to build momentum through relevance in our brands and better products to drive incrementally better margins year-over-year, especially as we look to offset some of the structural changes that happen in the business when you shift into online. So anyway, we're focused on AUR. And as you said, we're focused on driving higher margins in the product space in the first half."

So listen, a 1% North America comp in Q4 is -- that reflects the positive momentum in the brand. And they've done so much hard work this year, restructuring their unprofitable fleet segments of it while investing in their stores. I mean we refreshed 70 of our go-forward stores. We intend to get to the rest by mid-year. And I was in a store in New Jersey recently, and the customer stopped in her tracks and said, ""This is light, bright and happy."" I mean what's a better statement than that for -- to hear from our customers. We're seeing a really nice pickup in Net Promoter Score as a result of our refresh plan.
So the restructure of the stores, the improvement of the go-forward fleet, the leaning out of the SG&A -- and this is a lean, mean effective team now that is wired and has a culture oriented to winning. They're attracting new customers. Their team launch, for example, there are -- is now representing about 17% of the kids business. And they're centered, grounded in sustainable product offerings. So really pleased to see their overall discounting reduced. 
And then the partnerships. Partnerships are important part of the future of the brand. We have a big launch coming up with YEEZY Gap. And I spoke to YEEZY last night. He's very, very focused on this incredible opportunity. We're both very excited about it. And he and Mark and the entire Gap team are heads down and believe this to be a very big potential for us and look forward to sharing more with you as we launch in the first half. 
And then our licensing program, that plan that we signed last year, we expect some big launches in multi-categories across lifestyle coming up here later part of this year. So lots of levers to drive the momentum in Gap while dealing with the structural issues that have plagued the brand. 
And what makes me the happiest, honestly, is to see the fact that the brand is trending. It's trending with the younger customers. It's trending on TikTok. The new spring launch is incredibly relevant. And we're seeing massive impressions, whether it was Kornacki's khakis during the election or what we're seeing today, the brand is back in the conversation at the zeitgeist of culture where it belongs. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to deliver excellent execution with discipline every day to live up to the promise of that brand's potential."

As we had said in our investor event, 2020 was COVID, 2021 is a return to profitable sales growth. But we do -- we have said that the first half still contemplates some of the COVID-related impacts. And so whether that's a little bit of weight on the sales driven by store traffic or market closures, whether it's health and safety costs or fulfillment costs based on the airfreight that we need to get around the port or whatever it is, there are incremental costs still in that 5% that are associated with having to navigate the pandemic. 
So as we pivot to getting out of the pandemic, one of the levers we'll have is to sunset those, as I talked about. And then as you said, some of the levers in our favor in the year are really reaping the benefits of the store closures as well as some of the productivity initiatives we've already put in place and some of the impact of moving towards the Old Navy and Athleta operating margin -- higher operating margin brands. 
And then to come, honestly, is a lot of the work we're going to do around partnering markets as well as really leaning into, as I said in my prepared remarks, really reengineering the fixed operating costs in the business more systematically through digitizing operations as well as some of the margin initiatives like inventory management and such that we think will start to help offset the impact of shifting to online. So more to come on that, but the 5%, again, is very much on the path that we expected and still, unfortunately, have some of the COVID-related costs in it."

We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings p",2631,"Thank you, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings per share. Our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands are competing well, gaining share and expanding gross margins, driven by strong product and creative execution and digital dominance. And we're making progress on our transformation initiatives that are critical to our goal of growing sales profitably and expanding operating margins. We're optimistic that the consumer will remain strong, particularly in the U.S. and that our iconic brands, well-located stores and digital advantage will remain relevant as consumers transition back to work and school. And while our business did benefit from stimulus spending in Q1 as well as a faster recovery due to accelerated vaccine deployment, we're very pleased with the way we leveraged our competitive advantages, our brands, our portfolio and our platform to win this quarter. 
With that, let me share a few highlights from the quarter that demonstrate our continued progress against our Power Plan 2023 strategy. Starting with delivering sales growth. First, our revenue grew 8% versus 2019. We're pleased with this strong performance, recognizing it includes nearly 5 points of impact from our strategic North America store closure plan over that time period, as well as roughly 2 points of impact from COVID-related store closures outside of the U.S. Our U.S. market share is the highest we've seen in recent years at 5.5%, up 90 basis points versus last year. At nearly $4 billion, this was the largest Q1 revenue in the company's history. 
We're happy with the standout performance of Old Navy and Athleta, which grew net sales 27% and 56% respectively in Q1 versus 2019. Combined Old Navy and Athleta represent sales in Q1, moving closer to our target of 70% by the end of 2023. Sonia will talk more about how they compete to win a little bit later. 
There's also a meaningful progress at Gap brand. Gap North America delivered a 9% comp versus 2019, underscoring the progress the brand is making in the product and operations of its core business. The brand has become more digitally led and is realizing the margin benefit of closing unprofitable stores, while also reinvigorating the brand with great creative and product execution. And lastly, we're excited about the changes occurring at Banana Republic, its updated product design, realigned pricing architecture, in-store experience and updated brand creative. While we aren't yet seeing growth at Banana Republic, the team is focused on regaining relevance and repositioning Banana Republic for a post-COVID world. 
Our commitment to becoming digitally-led company is paying off. At over $6 billion in sales in fiscal 2020, our online channel was ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales, and when leveraged with our well-located fleet, is a strategic advantage in serving our customers through an omnichannel lens. And in Q1, online momentum continued, with sales growth up 82% versus 2019, ending the quarter at 40% of total sales compared to 25% in 2019. 
Next, we're strategically driving down fixed costs and reallocating a portion to demand generation in support of our sales growth. Several expense levers, strategic store closures and productivity and operating expenses, especially in stores, have helped us weather pandemic-related costs in the quarter and allowed us to lean into demand-generating investments such as marketing and digital enhancements. Our strategic investment in marketing over the last several quarters has helped us gain market share in a dislocated apparel market and we're leveraging that share consolidation to drive growth now.
We've driven improvement in product margins over the last few quarters as customers have responded to our brand-building marketing. In addition, we've delivered creative execution and relevant product, supporting higher regular-priced selling and reduced discounts. While freight and shipping costs as well as pandemic-related supply chain headwinds persist, this margin expansion provided an offset against these rising costs. Our fleet rationalization is on track and driving significant economic value. I'll share more details in a moment, but we remain on track to closing 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023. Higher online sales, store closures, both in the quarter and last year, along with lease negotiations and abatement settlements contributed 430 basis points of ROD leverage in Q1 versus 2019. 
We're making progress on leveraging partnerships as a capital-efficient way to amplify our iconic brands and drive profitable sales, particularly at Gap brand. Yesterday, the brand announced an exclusive deal with Walmart.com to deliver Gap Home. Sonia will speak more about this later, but this is an example of how through partnerships, we can extend the reach of our brands to customers across product categories, markets and channels. 
Our strategic review of our European market presence is underway. We're evaluating options across France, Italy, the U.K. and Ireland. Gap Brand has a strong brand recognition in Europe and whether through a franchise model or online, we look forward to providing Gap products to our European customers. We'll share more progress on our evaluation as we move through the year. 
As part of our Power Plan 2023, we committed to profitably growing our $4 billion lifestyle brands. In support of this strategic initiative, we completed the sale of our Janie and Jack business in the first quarter and completed the sale of the Intermix business early in the second quarter. While these transactions won't materially affect EBIT, the brands together contributed approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. This change further enables management to focus on the core brands and remove fixed costs in the portfolio. 
And finally, we've generated meaningful free cash flow, ending the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet supports our investment for growth in 2021 through capital expenditures, while also resuming our long-standing practice of returning cash to shareholders. We initiated a new dividend in the second quarter and are returning to our program of share repurchases intended to offset dilution. We're also closely monitoring our debt position. Based on current market prices of our notes, we don't believe it's in the best interest of shareholders to repurchase or restructure at this time. While we're not planning any near-term actions related to our debt, we are actively watching the markets and interest rates so we can take action at the appropriate time. 
Before I move on to our revised 2021 outlook, I want to say I'm proud of how the team leaned into our competitive advantages, maximizing our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value. As we look to the balance of 2021, despite the remaining uncertainty related to the COVID pandemic, our first quarter performance gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook today. On a reported basis, the company now anticipates full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, we're raising our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75. 
So let me turn to our Q1 financials and starting with sales, net sales for the quarter were $4 billion, up 8% versus 2019. Comp sales were up 28% versus a year ago and up 13% versus 2019. While overall performance was quite good, Q1 sales were negatively impacted by the continued resurgence in the COVID pandemic that resulted in unplanned mandated store closures and restrictions across Canada, Japan, China and Europe. As noted, the pandemic-related impact to first quarter sales versus 2019 is estimated to be approximately 2 percentage points. In addition, the sales decline related to strategically planned permanent store closures had an estimated impact of about 5 percentage points versus 2019. Overall store sales in Q1 were down 16% versus 2019. The decline in store sales is attributable to an estimated 7 points of sales impact from permanent closures and an estimated 3 points of sales impact from international market COVID-mandated closures. Our online sales grew 82% versus 2019 and contributed 40% of sales in the quarter. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings release. 
Turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin rate was 40.8%, leveraging 450 basis points versus 2019. Our margin expansion is as follows: ROD leveraged 430 basis points versus 2019, due to the increase in online sales 2019, reflecting higher product margin due to lower promotional activities, offsetting approximately 200 basis points of higher shipping costs associated with increased online sales. 
Turning to SG&A, first quarter reported operating expenses were $1.4 billion and 34.8% of sales. Excluding $56 million in charges related to divestiture activity in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses were $1.3 billion or 33.4% of sales, deleveraging 60 basis points versus Q1 2019 adjusted SG&A. The 60 basis points of deleverage is due to the following dynamics: deleverage of 120 basis points due to elevated compensation costs as part of the company's pay for performance philosophy, higher distribution center costs of 40 basis points in support of the company's online expansion. And importantly, productivity and store expenses of 230 basis points were partially redeployed into demand generation as marketing investment was higher and deleveraged 140 basis points. The greater investment in demand generation resulted in 0.9 point of market share gain for Gap Inc. in Q1 versus a year ago, ending in the quarter at 5.5% of total U.S. apparel market share. 
Turning to operating margin, on a reported basis, first quarter total operating income was $240 million or 6% of sales. On an adjusted basis, first quarter operating income totaled $296 million with operating margin of 7.4%, expanding 390 basis points versus adjusted 2019 operating margin. 
Moving to taxes and interest, the reported effective tax rate was [ 11.2% ] for the first quarter. The lower first quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the onetime income tax benefit related to divestiture activity in the quarter. Excluding this impact, the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%.  And first quarter net interest expense was $53 million. 
Turning to EPS, our first quarter reported earnings per share was $0.43. Excluding charges related to divestiture activity, adjusted earnings per share was $0.48. To provide some perspective on inventory, total inventory was up 6% versus the first quarter of 2019 and up 7% versus the year ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to COVID-related U.S. port congestion and the impact on shipping lanes resulting in higher in-transit inventory levels. Importantly, we remain pleased with the content of our inventory, with markdown ownership below 2020 and 2019, and are confident in our ability to deliver product margins above last year's levels in Q2. We now expect Q2 inventory growth versus 2020 to be in the range of high single digits to mid-teens, acknowledging the volatility regarding COVID-related supply chain disruptions impacting in-transit inventory levels. 
Moving to real estate and store closures, in the first quarter, we closed 6 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America, consistent with our strategy of improving the profitability of our store fleet. We still anticipate closing approximately 75 stores in 2021, which will bring us to approximately 75% of our goal of closing 350 stores in North America by the end of 2023. We anticipate that store closures in 2021 will be weighted toward the back half of the year based on the timing of lease expirations. In addition, on a net basis, we opened 25 Old Navy and Athleta stores, consistent with our plans to expand their customer reach. 
During the quarter, we incurred store-related cash outlays of about $6 million for North America. In 2021, we continue to estimate cash outlays of about $135 million related to store closures. As noted previously, as of the end of 2023, we expect that the full store rationalization program will yield annualized pretax savings of about $100 million. This estimate does not include the strategic review of our Europe market, which remains in progress. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow was $216 million in the quarter. As a result of the company's strong cash flow performance, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company ended the quarter with 377 million shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to Sonia, let me touch on our financial outlook for 2021, which we are raising across all key measures. We believe the biggest domestic impact from the pandemic is largely behind us, with the U.S. market showing signs of strength, driven by stimulus in Q1 and a faster recovery from the accelerated vaccine rollout. While we are seeing a healthier macro environment in the U.S., we expect lingering impacts to continue globally as seen in market closures and stay-at-home restrictions in Canada, China, Japan and Europe. In addition, while our strategies are working and showing good results, we're also watching the evolving pressures on our supply chain from both COVID outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia as well as the ongoing raw material supply pressures. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide the following revised guidance for fiscal year 2021. On a reported basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Q1 charges associated with the divestiture activity, we now expect our earnings per share -- adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75, a $0.40 increase versus prior year outlook. Both our reported and adjusted outlook exclude the potential impact associated with ongoing strategic reviews in Europe. 
Now let me provide you with some additional guidance metrics for 2021. We are raising our sales outlook and now anticipate full year net sales growth to be in the range of low to mid-20% versus fiscal year 2020. Notably, this revised outlook reflects the lost revenue attributable to the recent sale of Janie and Jackson and Intermix, which combined on an annual basis, represented approximately 2% of company sales. 
Our reported and adjusted operating margin guidance is now approximately 6%, an increase from our previous guidance of about 5%. This reflects an acceleration of our progress towards reaching a 10% operating margin by the end of 2023. We anticipate a modestly higher level of SG&A spending as a percentage of sales in Q2 versus Q1. With a disproportionate advantage in back-to-school, primarily at Gap and Old Navy, we plan to invest more heavily in marketing and digital assets to drive market share during this important time. Additionally, the integrated launch of our loyalty program in the fall is supported by elevated investments in customer-facing technology. This modest increase in SG&A spend in Q2 is fully contemplated in the higher operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2021 of about 6%. 
And lastly, I want to note the company's focus on returning cash to shareholders. First, we announced earlier this month that the company will pay a Q2 dividend of $0.12 a share, recognizing the strength of our balance sheet and continuing a long history of paying regular dividends to shareholders. In addition, we'll resume share repurchases with the intent to offset dilution. Subject to market conditions and other considerations, the company expects to repurchase up to $200 million of shares under the program for the remainder of fiscal year 2021. 
In closing, our first quarter performance reflects a strong start to 2021, with profitable sales growth and operating margin expansion versus 2019. This strong start is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook, putting us on an accelerated path to our long-term goals. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sonia."

And as Katrina mentioned, our sales were up significantly year-over-year and exceeded our 2019 results. 
Our strong performance in Q1 can be attributed to 2 things. First, and most importantly, our Power Plan 2023 is taking hold. And second, the macro tailwinds, which included a third round of stimulus checks and increased vaccine distribution created an inflection point. Our teams are maniacally focused on growing our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands, and our customers are responding. The marketing investments we've made over the last several quarters to fuel demand coupled with the macro tailwinds are supercharging our business. The share we strategically took in 2020 during the consolidation in the apparel market drove outsized momentum in Q1, especially in Old Navy and Athleta, and we're feeling great about the health of Gap business in North America. 
According to NPD, our market share gains outpaced the industry average and as Katrina shared, were the highest we've seen in recent years. Customers are emerging from the pandemic with a new found appreciation for social connections and a chance to express their style. At the same time, customers are holding on to the comfort they found in the spaces and rituals created over the last year. As store's traffic rebounded, we sustained our digital dominance, with online growth up 61% year-over-year and 82% when compared to 2019. Growth in active and fleece continue to rise showing customers' hesitance to let go of the cozy mentality, while we saw a resurgence in dresses and summer fashion as customers also wish for a spring awakening. While these trends benefited the entire industry, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the And factor: joggers and dresses; digital and in-store; stepping out and staying in. Customers are embracing their own blend of And, which allows us to play to our strength. 
While we're pleased with the Q1 and we are seeing great progress in our U.S. market, we understand that the pandemic is far from over on a global scale. With the resurgence in cases in Canada, Europe, China and Japan, COVID impact on demand in international markets is still meaningful. And more critically, due to rising cases in countries we source from, like India, we are facing supply chain and raw material challenges. Still, agility and flexibility and scale have become a strong muscle across the team. And as we monitor and mitigate these headwinds, I'm confident we have the right levers to pull. We're on track and feel positive about the progress we're making against our Power Plan 2023. We are taking swift action as needed, while shifting investments to grow our iconic brands in new and profitable ways for the long term. 
Let me elaborate on some of Katrina's remarks and walk you through how this showed up this quarter, starting with the power of our brands. I'm particularly energized by how each of our brands are demonstrating brand power to compete and take profitable share. I attribute this to having trend-right product, purpose-led marketing and brand-amplifying creative partnerships resulting in improved brand health and stronger customer relevance. Across our brands, we are harnessing our pricing power, reducing promotions and directly investing to drive demand. 
Let me first talk about Old Navy. While the overall market has strengthened, Old Navy is taking share, outpacing the industry. The brand maintains its position as the #2 apparel brand in the U.S. and now sits as the #6 apparel retailer on a rolling 3-month basis according to NPD. The stimulus consumer optimism strong product acceptance and full funnel marketing drove a remarkable quarter. Old Navy stores delivered profitable growth even with COVID closures. And at the same time, our online growth continued to accelerate. Newly-acquired customers are spending more, thanks to marketing investments in brand-building storytelling like their Vintage Vibe campaign, which tapped into today's TikTok generation. In their most recent campaign, Old Navy teamed up with NBA Hall of Famer, Magic Johnson, to share the success stories of 3 inspiring graduates from our career skills and mentoring program, This Way Onward. 
Growth in key categories like active and fleece remains strong, while seasonal categories like dresses, shorts and denim are coming back. Strength in stores and the shift in product mix signal a new stage in pandemic recovery as vaccines rollout, enabling the return of family vacations and in-person learning. Old Navy anticipates distorted share acquisition in kids and baby from distressed retailers. And when paired with customer exuberance, sets us up for a strong back-to-school performance. 
Building on a successful sleepwear business, Old Navy extended into intimates in April to further deliver on the needs of our customers' whole lives. And since the launch has picked up 0.5 point of market share and moved into the top 20 intimates retailers. We're also looking forward to the brand's expansion of inclusive sizing to all stores later this year. With one of the broadest size ranges in the industry, but largely limited to online, this serves to further its commitment to the democracy of style and better serve our existing plus customers with a physical space to shop and engage with us. 
Next, Gap. Momentum accelerated in Q1 with modern American optimism coming to life through improved product, evolving and clear creative direction and overall sharper execution. While COVID-related closures in Asia and Europe impacted sales meaningfully in the quarter, Gap North America is growing, healthy and cool, delivering a positive 9% 2-year comp with margin expansion. The team is focused on building relevance in the U.S., which, in turn, gives us the power to explore that relevance globally. Gap's Generation Good campaign featured passionate teen activists and self-defined creators who are forging a positive and inclusive path forward, resonated deeply and that resonated deeply with customers. And they are responding to Gap's effortless style, driving lower discounting and giving the brand pricing power. 
Priority categories active, sleep and fleece accelerated, resulted in double-digit sales growth versus Q1 2019. And like Old Navy, kids and baby sales were strong as many kids returned to the classroom, they grew, and it all bodes well for a strong back-to-school season later this summer. Work is underway on the YEEZY Gap collaboration with Kanye West. Again, we're approaching this launch with deep intention, and we expect to share more with you in the next few months. 
And as we announced today, we're optimistic about our venture into home with the launch of Gap Home at Walmart.com this summer. $164 billion category in the U.S. alone, Home is a natural extension of apparel in a category where storytelling drives sales, both a natural fit as we build lifestyle brands, leveraging our model of partnering to amplify, the Gap and Walmart partnership is a capital-efficient alternative to acquiring capabilities in-house. The assortment is sustainably made, beautifully curated, incredibly priced, and we cannot wait to see Gap's modern American optimism translated to home and kids dorm rooms later this year. 
Turning to Banana Republic, the new team at Banana Republic is making progress laying the foundation for its transformation. Over the quarter, they've made strides in realigning their pricing architecture and yield management improving the physical in-store experience and updating brand creative. To restore brand relevance, the team has identified both target customer groups and the core cultural trends to inform our new brand positioning, our new product design and our customer engagement approach. Banana Republic showed off stunning floral windows to welcome spring ahead of the launch of a capsule collection by the emerging designer, Prep Curry, who mix the streetwear with bold florals and dual gender style. This collection largely sold out in under a week, showing the demand we can create through limited edition partnerships. Laying the path to the future will take time, and we are steadfast in our mission to reestablish Banana Republic's marketplace position as a leading affordable luxury lifestyle brand. 
Now what a quarter for Athleta. Athleta drove outsized digital growth while achieving record full-price sales through gains in performance lifestyle products, particularly warm weather shorts, dresses, swim and tanks. And it really differentiates us from the competition. Performance of inclusive sizing has grown steadily since its January launch, with 70% of the athletic collection now available in 1x to 3x. Athleta has some really major wins in its effort to raise brand awareness by amplifying our values. The All Powerful campaign drove overwhelmingly positive engagement at 2x the industry benchmark, with impressions across print and digital totaling over 160 million. And Athleta will have 2 gold metal athletes at the world stage in Tokyo this summer, who will amplify the brand's mission to empower women and girls. 
Simone Biles joins Allyson Felix as the brand's newest ambassador and will bring her personal story of unparalleled career achievement along with her journey of pushing through pain and adversity. These value-led partnerships are driving the awareness of Athleta. And in fact, when we announced our partnership with Simone Biles, Athleta had the highest non-holiday search result in their history. Investments in digital are paying off with app performance exceeding expectations and success in digital marketing is driving new customer growth to historic highs, pushing Athleta's total customer file to [ 4.5 million ] in Q1. Athleta also announced plans to open stores in Canada later this year, joining Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic. With an online site launch later this summer and 2 stores planned for fall, this moves as proof point in our strategy to extend customers' access through new entry points. 
Our vision to grow purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands is taking hold. And as Katrina mentioned earlier, we're transforming our brand portfolio to align with our Power Plan 2023. We successfully wound down [ Helsetti ] and divested Janie & Jack and Intermix. These moves allow us to focus and prioritize our strategic intent and put resources behind the brands with the most potential and that generate the most sales. 
Next, the power of our platform. Our digitally-led mindset is paying off with our dominant omnichannel strength and scaled operations. Online sales grew nearly 60% versus the first quarter of last year and represented approximately 40% of the total business, even as sales rebounded in stores. And our omni teams delivered the largest march on record, shipping 13 million packages to customers in North America. As I shared last quarter, one of our main priorities in 2021 is optimizing our mobile experience. We launched our Android native app in March, and we're excited to be engaging with our Android customers. And strong contribution from our alternative payment providers, PayPal and Afterpay, represented 20% of online spend in Q1. With our leading omni platform, whether in stores or on mobile, through curbside pickup or our self-checkout pilot coming later this year, we're pushing for convenience and engaging experiences across the entire customer journey. We are laser focused on our SG&A transformation through increased productivity, organizational capacity and demand-generating investments. We're on track to close North America stores across Gap and Banana Republic in line with our strategy of releasing unproductive sales and the strategic review of our European business is still underway. 
Finally, the power of our portfolio. We're using our brands collective power to grow our customer file and extend brand reach. I've shared several ways our brands are doing this through store growth, market expansion and product extensions. And we had 20 -- sorry, 62 million active customers globally. And we acquired over 60% more online customers than this time last year, and that is a really big deal. We're on a mission to create loyalists. We enrolled more than 5 million customers in our multi-tender loyalty program in Q1. And on average, they are spending far more than customers not in our program. This gives us confidence ahead of our integrated loyalty program launch this summer. 
We also announced a new credit card agreement with Barclays and Mastercard that will begin in May 2022. We feel that the level of technology and personalization capabilities that Barclays brings to the partnership fit perfectly with our strategy to use new and more effective ways to speak to our customers. 
The power of our portfolio also means our brands can drive sustainable change at scale. Old Navy's move to eliminate plastic shopping bags in the U.S. and Canada by 2023 is a meaningful step in our waste reduction efforts. Gap brand's latest Generation Good collection has the most sustainable tees and denim to date. More than 60% of Banana Republic's 2021 spring collection was manufactured using more sustainable fibers. And through its solar power purchase agreement, Athleta brought additional renewable energy to the grid that is helping offset more than 100% of the electricity it uses to power its stores. Finally, our freshly-branded company mailer will be made with 50% recycled content, leaving an optimistic first impression on our customer and further reducing our use of virgin plastic. We choose to see sustainability to an inclusion lens and these efforts demonstrate our deep belief in empowering women, enabling opportunity and enriching communities, all part of our purpose to be inclusive by design. 
Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to touch on our talented team because this is a team effort. We are creating a performance and owner culture for all with shared accountability in our business results. And I want to take a moment to acknowledge and honor a job well done over the last year and quarter, one that was particularly challenging for our frontline team members, 96% of whom maintained loyalty through furloughs and served as the lifeblood of our business through the acute COVID impact. 
When business is good, we believe vehemently that this is the time to push ourselves harder to strive for continuous improvement and to reach even further for growth across our brands. Momentum is on our side, and we intend to capitalize. History suggests a spurt of innovation comes out of every crisis and the strength of our brands, platform and portfolio, coupled with our creative audacity suggests an exciting road ahead. So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And I'm just wondering how you think about that number relative to other companies that have brands they tend to be a little bit higher than that? And then of that spend, how are you thinking about proportioning it among the different brands? 
And then for Katrina, can you give us either a line of sight of where Gap and BR are trending now for operating margin? Or alternatively, when you get to the 10% margin, what is the target for those 2 pieces of the business?"

I mean we'll see where revenue is. But that is -- it will be sort of lumpy by quarter. And as we said in the speech, we are going to lean a little bit more into Q2. We actually didn't hit the 6% marketing in Q1. And so we did sort of reserve some of that money for Q2 to invest in back-to-school, as we said, in the loyalty launch. So it's going to be lumpy, but I think 6% is about what we're thinking, and we'll see. Sonia may or may not have said a lot of our marketing is digital. We can read it week to week. It's very flexible. And so we'll lean in as appropriate. 
With regards to operating margin, we haven't broken those out by brand. I think we've acknowledged that Old Navy and Athleta are the highest operating margins. But certainly, the restructuring at Gap and Banana is intended to really pick out the lack of profitability at those brands and bring them back up. All of that's contemplated in various scenarios in the 10% operating margin goal, and we haven't really said more than that."

And on the bottom line, I guess how best to think about product margin expansion drivers as we think about the second quarter against pretty healthy expansion a year ago?"

So specific to Old Navy, they're really seeing strength on the distortion on product and the acceleration of comfort and cozy, whether it's the fleece and active dominance that they've seen and really big growth there, triple-digit growth. With the resurgence in the lifestyle products such as dresses and shorts, it's really the power of the And, right? The family is wanting all of these choices from Old Navy. So the product acceleration between those big And uses, then you couple it with the kids and baby [indiscernible] that it maybe has as the #1 brand in the kids and baby space. All of that yields really, really great execution on product. 
And then they've deployed excellent new pricing strategies this quarter as well that you'll see in stores and online with everyday magic pricing, which has allowed day in, day out pricing for about 20% of the assortment. It's -- we see this as growing. We see this as something customers are really responding to, and it's enabled the margin expansion on top of the product acceptance. And then the innovation that's happening in the site has really maintained our e-commerce momentum. As you know, technology investment is a big deal for us. That's manifesting in a stronger -- momentum in the e-commerce business. The loyalty enablement, we know how much more customers spend with loyalty. So those technology and loyalty investments are paying off and building. And then lastly, I'd say the stores recovery from the COVID time has been fantastic. And customers are loving the experience. They want a physical shopping space where the family can come and really have something that is human centered and that's what they're experiencing in the stores. They're happy to be back, and we're happy to have them."

So when I think about margin for the year, what I would say is the rent and occupancy leverage that we're seeing is largely on track based on the work we've done to shut the North America stores and get the lease renegotiations that we worked so hard on last year. And so I would say about 75% or 80% of that 430 bps we saw in Q1 would continue for the year and continue to add significant value to our margin expansion. 
And then on the product margin side, we're -- as Sonia said, we're really pleased with the way our brands are competing and whether that's the right product, the right creative, the right brand values, the right marketing, all of that is giving us the power to pull back on discounting. In Q1, that allowed us to offset shipping. And we'll see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But certainly, we expect product margins should continue to be higher on a year-over-year basis. 
What we're watching honestly on the margin side of things is what everyone, I think, has talked about, which is whether supply chain issues will require air freight in order to be able to continue to get inventory here whether there will be commodities pressures in the back half. We'll see how all that plays out. We've been navigating that closely and using our advantaged supply chain to help us mitigate what we can. But certainly, all of that's on our minds as we think about the back half of the year. But all those scenarios are reflected in the 6% operating margin. And I think as we said on the call, we had originally expected 5% this year. We're now guiding to 6%. And so all of that feels like we're accelerating towards our 10% plan, and we're proud of that."

And every day with customers and across social media, we see the hype building from speculation around the product to supposed launch dates. 
The YEEZY Gap is a work in progress and remains a significant opportunity for us. And will it be Q2 or Q3, we'll see. What I can tell you is that the creativity is through the roof and it's spilling over to the brand. And it's inspiring our teams more broadly. So we are very energized by what we're seeing, and we know our customers will be too. We're planning for a multiyear effect here, multiyear business. So we're confident in that potential.

We don't know yet how much we will or won't have to air in order to get that here or if there will be freight implications.

If you add them all up, it's a fairly sizable business now. Old Navy has seen some great success, particularly with their unique aesthetic, there -- they've introduced these great colorful undergarments that really stand out in the market. And I think we're seeing customer response to that. 
The average transaction volume in Old Navy has really grown. So that implies that we're not only expanding the basket for existing customers, but also the customer growth is there. So it's both. I would say it's the Ands that we spoke about in the script, we're seeing more customers and they're spending more of which -- the intimates being one of the drivers."

We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings p",2650,"Thank you, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings per share.
Our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands are competing well, gaining share and expanding gross margins, driven by strong product and creative execution and digital dominance. And we're making progress on our transformation initiatives that are critical to our goal of growing sales profitably and expanding operating margins. We're optimistic that the consumer will remain strong, particularly in the U.S. and that our iconic brands, well-located stores and digital advantage will remain relevant as consumers transition back to work and school. And while our business did benefit from stimulus spending in Q1 as well as a faster recovery due to accelerated vaccine deployment, we're very pleased with the way we leveraged our competitive advantages, our brands, our portfolio and our platform to win this quarter.
With that, let me share a few highlights from the quarter that demonstrate our continued progress against our Power Plan 2023 strategy, starting with delivering sales growth.
First, our revenue grew 8% versus 2019. We're pleased with this strong performance, recognizing it includes nearly 5 points of impact from our strategic North America store closure plan over that time period as well as roughly 2 points of impact from COVID-related store closures outside of the U.S. Our U.S. market share is the highest we've seen in recent years at 5.5%, up 90 basis points versus last year. At nearly $4 billion, this was the largest Q1 revenue in the company's history.
We're happy with the standout performance of Old Navy and Athleta, which grew net sales 27% and 56%, respectively, in Q1 versus 2019. Combined, Old Navy and Athleta represented 66% of company sales in Q1, moving closer to our target of 70% by the end of 2023. Sonia will talk more about how they compete to win a little bit later.
There's also a meaningful progress at Gap brand. Gap North America delivered a 9% comp versus 2019, underscoring the progress the brand is making in the product and operations of its core business. The brand has become more digitally led and is realizing the margin benefit of closing unprofitable stores while also reinvigorating the brand with great creative and product execution.
And lastly, we're excited about the changes occurring at Banana Republic: its updated product design, realigned pricing architecture, in-store experience and updated brand creative. While we aren't yet seeing growth at Banana Republic, the team is focused on regaining relevance and repositioning Banana Republic for a post-COVID world.
Our commitment to becoming a digitally led company is paying off. At over $6 billion in sales in fiscal 2020, our online channel was ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales and, when leveraged with our well-located fleet, gives us strategic advantage in serving our customers through an omnichannel lens. And in Q1, online momentum continued with sales growth up 82% versus 2019, ending the quarter at 40% of total sales compared to 25% in 2019.
Next, we're strategically driving down fixed costs and reallocating a portion to demand generation in support of our sales growth. Several expense levers, strategic store closures and productivity and operating expenses, especially in stores, have helped us weather pandemic-related costs in the quarter and allowed us to lean into demand-generating investments, such as marketing and digital enhancements. Our strategic investment in marketing over the last several quarters has helped us gain market share in the dislocated apparel market, and we're leveraging that share consolidation to drive growth now.
We've driven improvement in product margins over the last few quarters as customers have responded to our brand-building marketing. In addition, we've delivered creative execution and relevant product, supporting higher regular price selling and reduced discounts. While freight and shipping costs as well as pandemic-related supply chain headwinds persist, this margin expansion provided an offset against these rising costs.
Our fleet rationalization is on track and driving significant economic value. I'll share more details in a moment, but we remain on track to closing 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023. Higher online sales, store closures, both in the quarter and last year, along with lease negotiations and abatement settlements, contributed 430 basis points of ROD leverage in Q1 versus 2019.
We're making progress on leveraging partnerships as a capital-efficient way to amplify our iconic brands and drive profitable sales, particularly at Gap brand. Yesterday, the brand announced an exclusive deal with Walmart.com to deliver Gap Home. Sonia will speak more about this later, but this is an example of how, through partnerships, we can extend the reach of our brands to customers across product categories, markets and channels.
Our strategic review of our European market presence is underway. We're evaluating options across France, Italy, the U.K. and Ireland. Gap brand has a strong brand recognition in Europe and whether through a franchise model or online, we look forward to providing Gap products to our European customers. We'll share more progress on our evaluation as we move through the year.
As part of our Power Plan 2023, we committed to profitably growing our $4 billion lifestyle brand. In support of this strategic initiative, we completed the sale of our Janie and Jack business in the first quarter and completed the sale of the Intermix business early in the second quarter. While these transactions won't materially affect EBIT, the brands together contributed approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. This change further enables management to focus on the core brands and remove fixed costs in the portfolio.
And finally, we've generated meaningful free cash flow, ending the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet supports our investment for growth in 2021 through capital expenditures while also resuming our long-standing practice of returning cash to shareholders.
We initiated a new dividend in the second quarter and are returning to our program of share repurchases intended to offset dilution. We're also closely monitoring our debt position. Based on current market prices of our notes, we don't believe it's in the best interest of shareholders to repurchase or restructure at this time. While we're not planning any near-term actions related to our debt, we are actively watching the markets and interest rates so we can take action at the appropriate time.
Before I move on to our revised 2021 outlook, I want to say I'm proud of how the team leaned into our competitive advantages, maximizing our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value. As we look to the balance of 2021, despite the remaining uncertainty related to the COVID pandemic, our first quarter performance gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook today. On a reported basis, the company now anticipates full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, we're raising our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75.
So let me turn to our Q1 financials and starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter were $4 billion, up 8% versus 2019. The comp sales were up 28% versus a year ago and up 13% versus 2019. While overall performance was quite good, Q1 sales were negatively impacted by the continued resurgence in the COVID pandemic that resulted in unplanned mandated store closures and restrictions across Canada, Japan, China and Europe. As noted, the pandemic-related impact to first quarter sales versus 2019 is estimated to be approximately 2 percentage points. In addition, the sales decline related to strategically planned permanent store closures had an estimated impact of about 5 percentage points versus 2019.
Overall store sales in Q1 were down 16% versus 2019. The decline in store sales is attributable to an estimated 7 points of sales impact from permanent closures and an estimated 3 points of sales impact from international market, COVID-mandated closures. Our online sales grew 82% versus 2019 and contributed 40% of sales in the quarter. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings release.
Turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin rate was 40.8%, leveraging 450 basis points versus 2019. Our margin expansion is as follows. ROD leveraged 430 basis points versus 2019 due to the increase in online sales, coupled with savings from store closures and rent negotiations. Merchandise margins expanded 20 basis points versus 2019, reflecting higher product margin due to lower promotional activities, offsetting approximately 200 basis points of higher shipping costs associated with increased online sales.
Turning to SG&A. First quarter reported operating expenses were $1.4 billion and 34.8% of sales. Excluding $56 million in charges related to divestiture activity in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses were $1.3 billion or 33.4% of sales, deleveraging 60 basis points versus Q1 2019 adjusted SG&A. The 60 basis points of deleverage is due to the following dynamics: deleverage of 120 basis points due to elevated compensation costs as part of the company's pay-for-performance philosophy; higher distribution center costs of 40 basis points in support of the company's online expansion; and importantly, productivity and store expenses of 230 basis points were partially redeployed into demand generation as marketing investment was higher and deleveraged 140 basis points. The greater investment and demand generation resulted in 0.9 point of market share gain for Gap, Inc. in Q1 versus a year ago, ending the quarter at 5.5% of total U.S. apparel market share.
Turning to operating margin. On a reported basis, first quarter total operating income was $240 million or 6% of sales. On an adjusted basis, first quarter operating income totaled $296 million with operating margin of 7.4%, expanding 390 basis points versus adjusted 2019 operating margin.
Moving to taxes and interest. The reported effective tax rate was 11.2% for the first quarter. The lower first quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the onetime income tax benefit related to divestiture activity in the quarter. Excluding this impact, the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. And first quarter net interest expense was $53 million.
Turning to EPS. Our first quarter reported earnings per share was $0.43. Excluding charges related to divestiture activity, adjusted earnings per share was $0.48.
To provide some perspective on inventory. Total inventory was up 6% versus the first quarter of 2019 and up 7% versus the year ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to COVID-related U.S. port congestion and the impact on shipping lanes, resulting in higher in-transit inventory levels. Importantly, we remain pleased with the content of our inventory with markdown ownership below 2020 and 2019 and are confident in our ability to deliver product margins above last year's levels in Q2. We now expect Q2 inventory growth versus 2020 to be in the range of high single digits to mid-teens, acknowledging the volatility regarding COVID-related supply chain disruptions impacting in-transit inventory levels.
Moving to real estate and store closures. In the first quarter, we closed 6 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America, consistent with our strategy of improving the profitability of our store fleet. We still anticipate closing approximately 75 stores in 2021, which will bring us to approximately 75% of our goal of closing 350 stores in North America by the end of 2023. We anticipate that store closures in 2021 will be weighted towards the back half of the year based on the timing of lease expirations. In addition, on a net basis, we opened 25 Old Navy and Athleta stores, consistent with our plans to expand their customer reach.
During the quarter, we incurred store-related cash outlays of about $6 million for North America. In 2021, we continue to estimate cash outlays of about $135 million related to store closures. As noted previously, as of the end of 2023, we expect that the full store rationalization program will yield annualized pretax savings of about $100 million. This estimate does not include the strategic review of our Europe market, which remains in progress.
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow was $216 million in the quarter. As a result of the company's strong cash flow performance, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company ended the quarter with 377 million shares outstanding.
Before I turn it over to Sonia, let me touch on our financial outlook for 2021, which we are raising across all key measures. We believe the biggest domestic impact from the pandemic is largely behind us, with the U.S. market showing signs of strength driven by stimulus in Q1 and a faster recovery from the accelerated vaccine rollout. While we are seeing a healthier macro environment in the U.S., we expect lingering impacts to continue globally as seen in market closures and stay-at-home restrictions in Canada, China, Japan and Europe. In addition, while our strategies are working and showing good results, we're also watching the evolving pressures on our supply chain from both COVID outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia as well as the ongoing raw material supply pressures.
With that in mind, I'd like to provide the following revised guidance for fiscal year 2021. On a reported basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Q1 charges associated with the divestiture activity, we now expect our earnings per share -- adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75, a $0.40 increase versus prior year outlook. Both our reported and adjusted outlooks exclude the potential impact associated with ongoing strategic reviews in Europe.
Now let me provide you with some additional guidance metrics for 2021. We are raising our sales outlook and now anticipate full year net sales growth to be in the range of low to mid-20% versus fiscal year 2020. Notably, this revised outlook reflects the lost revenue attributable to the recent sale of Janie and Jack and Intermix which, combined on an annual basis, represented approximately 2% of company sales.
Our reported and adjusted operating margin guidance is now approximately 6%, an increase from our previous guidance of about 5%. This reflects an acceleration of our progress towards reaching a 10% operating margin by the end of 2023. We anticipate a modestly higher level of SG&A spending as a percentage of sales in Q2 versus Q1. With a disproportionate advantage in back-to-school, primarily at Gap and Old Navy, we plan to invest more heavily in marketing and digital assets to drive market share during this important time. Additionally, the integrated launch of our loyalty program in the fall is supported by elevated investments in customer facing technology. This modest increase in SG&A spend in Q2 is fully contemplated in the higher operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2021 of about 6%.
And lastly, I want to note the company's focus on returning cash to shareholders. First, we announced earlier this month that the company will pay a Q2 dividend of $0.12 a share, recognizing the strength of our balance sheet and continuing a long history of paying regular dividends to shareholders. In addition, we'll resume share repurchases with the intent to offset dilution. Subject to market conditions and other considerations, the company expects to repurchase up to $200 million of shares under the program for the remainder of fiscal year 2021.
In closing, our first quarter performance reflects a strong start to 2021 with profitable sales growth and operating margin expansion versus 2019. This strong start is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook, putting us on an accelerated path to our long-term goals.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Sonia."
274265,713888795,2303169,"The Gap, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everyone.

And as Katrina mentioned, our sales were up significantly year-over-year and exceeded our 2019 results.Our strong performance in Q1 can be a",2368,"Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to be here today to share our first quarter results. And as Katrina mentioned, our sales were up significantly year-over-year and exceeded our 2019 results.
Our strong performance in Q1 can be attributed to 2 things. First, and most importantly, our Power Plan 2023 is taking hold. And second, the macro tailwinds, which included a third round of stimulus checks and increased vaccine distribution, created an inflection point.
Our teams are maniacally focused on growing our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands, and our customers are responding. The marketing investments we've made over the last several quarters to fuel demand, coupled with the macro tailwinds, are supercharging our business. The share we strategically took in 2020 during the consolidation in the apparel market drove outsized momentum in Q1, especially in Old Navy and Athleta, and we're feeling great about the health of Gap business in North America. According to NPD, our market share gains outpaced the industry average and, as Katrina shared, were the highest we've seen in recent years.
Customers are emerging from the pandemic with a newfound appreciation for social connections and a chance to express their style. At the same time, customers are holding on to the comfort they found in the spaces and virtuals created over the last year. As store traffic rebounded, we sustained our digital dominance with online growth up 61% year-over-year and 82% when compared to 2019. Growth in active and fleece continued to rise, showing customers' hesitance to let go of the cozy mentality. While we saw a resurgence in dresses and summer fashion as customers also wish for a spring awakening.
While these trends benefited the entire industry, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the ""and"" factor: joggers and dresses, digital and in-store, stepping out and staying in. Customers are embracing their own blend of ""and"" which allows us to play to our strength.
While we're pleased with the Q1, and we are seeing great progress in our U.S. market, we understand that the pandemic is far from over on a global scale. With the resurgence in cases in Canada, Europe, China and Japan, COVID impact on demand in international markets is still meaningful. And more critically, due to rising cases in countries we source from, like India, we are facing supply chain and raw material challenges. Still, agility and flexibility and scale have become a strong muscle across the team. And as we monitor and mitigate these headwinds, I'm confident we have the right levers to pull.
We're on track and feel positive about the progress we're making against our Power Plan 2023. We are taking swift action as needed while shifting investments to grow our iconic brands in new and profitable ways for the long term.
Let me elaborate on some of Katrina's remarks and walk you through how this showed up this quarter, starting with the Power of our Brands. I'm particularly energized by how each of our brands are demonstrating brand power to compete and take profitable share. I attribute this to having trend-right product, purpose-led marketing and brand-amplifying creative partnerships, resulting in improved brand health and stronger customer relevance. Across our brands, we are harnessing our pricing power, we're reducing promotions and directly investing to drive demand.
Let me first talk about Old Navy. While the overall market has strengthened, Old Navy is taking share, outpacing the industry. The brand maintains its position as the #2 apparel brand in the U.S. and now sits as the #6 apparel retailer on a rolling 3-month basis according to NPD. The stimulus, consumer optimism, strong product acceptance and full funnel marketing drove a remarkable quarter. Old Navy stores delivered profitable growth even with COVID closures. And at the same time, our online growth continued to accelerate. Newly acquired customers are spending more, thanks to marketing investments in brand-building storytelling, like their Vintage Vibes campaign, which tapped into today's TikTok generation.
In their most recent campaign, Old Navy teamed up with NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson to share the success stories of 3 inspiring graduates from our career skills and mentoring program, This Way ONward. Growth in key categories like active and fleece remains strong, while seasonal categories like dresses, shorts and denim are coming back. Strength in stores and the shift in product mix signal a new stage in pandemic recovery as vaccines roll out, enabling the return of family vacations and in-person learning. Old Navy anticipates distorted share acquisition in kids and baby from distressed retailers and, when paired with customer exuberance, sets us up for a strong back-to-school performance.
Building on a successful sleepwear business, Old Navy extended into intimates in April to further deliver on the needs of our customers' full lives and, since the launch, has picked up 0.5 point of market share and moved into the top 20 intimates retailers. We're also looking forward to the brand's expansion of inclusive sizing to all stores later this year. With one of the broadest size ranges in the industry, but largely limited to online, this serves to further its commitment to the democracy of style and better serve our existing plus customers with a physical space to shop and engage with us.
Next, Gap. Momentum accelerated in Q1 with modern American optimism coming to life through improved product, evolving and clear creative direction and overall sharper execution. While COVID-related closures in Asia and Europe impacted sales meaningfully in the quarter, Gap North America is growing, healthy and cool, delivering a positive 9% 2-year comp with margin expansion. The team is focused on building relevance in the U.S. which, in turn, gives us the power to explore that relevance globally.
Gap's Generation Good campaign featured passionate teen activists and self-defined creators who are forging a positive and inclusive path forward, and that resonated deeply with customers. And they are responding to Gap's effortless style, driving lower discounting and giving the brand pricing power.
Priority categories active, sleep and fleece accelerated, resulting in double-digit sales growth versus Q1 2019. And like Old Navy, kids and baby sales were strong as many kids returned to the classroom, they grew, and it all bodes well for a strong back-to-school season later this summer.
Work is underway on the Yeezy Gap collaboration with Kanye West. Again, we're approaching this launch with deep intention, and we expect to share more with you in the next few months.
And as we announced today, we're optimistic about our venture into home with the launch of Gap Home at Walmart.com this summer. $164 billion category in the U.S. alone, home is a natural extension of apparel and a category where storytelling drives sales, a natural fit as we build lifestyle brands. Leveraging our model of partnering to amplify, the Gap and Walmart partnership is a capital-efficient alternative to acquiring capabilities in-house. The assortment is sustainably made, beautifully curated, incredibly priced, and we cannot wait to see Gap's modern American optimism translated to home and kids' dorm rooms later this year.
Turning to Banana Republic. The new team at Banana Republic is making progress, laying the foundation for its transformation. Over the quarter, they've made strides in realigning their pricing architecture and yield management, improving the physical in-store experience and updating brand creative. To restore brand relevance, the team has identified both target customer groups and the core cultural trends to inform our new brand positioning, our new product design and our customer engagement approach.
Banana Republic showed off stunning floral windows to welcome spring ahead of the launch of a capsule collection by the emerging designer, Prep Curry, who mixes streetwear with bold florals and dual-gender style. This collection largely sold out in under a week, showing the demand we can create through limited edition partnerships. Laying the path for the future will take time, and we are steadfast in our mission to reestablish Banana Republic's marketplace position as a leading, affordable luxury lifestyle brand.
Now what a quarter for Athleta. Athleta drove outsized digital growth while achieving record full price sales through gains in performance lifestyle products, particularly warm weather shorts, dresses, swim and tanks. And it really differentiates us from the competition. Performance of inclusive sizing has grown steadily since its January launch, with 70% of the athletic collection now available in 1X to 3X.
Athleta had some really major wins in its effort to raise brand awareness by amplifying our values. The All Powerful campaign drove overwhelmingly positive engagement at 2x the industry benchmarks with impressions across print and digital, totaling over 160 million. And Athleta will have 2 gold metal athletes at the world stage in Tokyo this summer who will amplify the brand's mission to empower women and girls. Simone Biles joins Allyson Felix as the brand's newest ambassador and will bring her personal story of unparalleled career achievement, along with her journey of pushing through pain and adversity. These value-led partnerships are driving the awareness of Athleta. And in fact, when we announced our partnership with Simone Biles, Athleta had the highest non-holiday search result in their history.
Investments in digital are paying off with app performance exceeding expectations, and success in digital marketing is driving new customer growth to historic highs, pushing Athleta's total customer file to $4.5 million in Q1. Athleta also announced plans to open stores in Canada later this year, joining Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic. With an online site launch later this summer and 2 stores planned for fall, this move is proof point in our strategy to extend customers' access through new entry points.
Our vision to grow purpose-led, billion-dollar lifestyle brands is taking hold. And as Katrina mentioned earlier, we're transforming our brand portfolio to align with our Power Plan 2023. We successfully wound down Hill City and divested Janie and Jack and Intermix. These moves allow us to focus and prioritize our strategic intent and put resources behind the brands with the most potential and that generate the most sales.
Next, the Power of our Platform. Our digitally-led mindset is paying off with our dominant omnichannel strength and scaled operations. Online sales grew nearly 60% versus the first quarter of last year and represented approximately 40% of the total business even as sales rebounded in stores. And our omni team delivered the largest March on record, shipping 13 million packages to customers in North America.
As I shared last quarter, one of our main priorities in 2021 is optimizing our mobile experience. We launched our Android native app in March, and we're excited to be engaging with our Android customers. And strong contribution from our alternative payment providers, PayPal and Afterpay, represented 20% of online spend in Q1.
With our leading omni platform, whether in stores or on mobile, through curbside pickup or our self-checkout pilot coming later this year, we're pushing for convenience and engaging experiences across the entire customer journey.
We are laser-focused on our SG&A transformation through increased productivity, organizational capacity and demand-generating investments. We're on track to close North America stores across Gap and Banana Republic, in line with our strategy of releasing unproductive sales. And the strategic review of our European business is still underway.
Finally, the Power of our Portfolio. We're using our brands' collective power to grow our customer file and extend brand reach. I've shared several ways our brands are doing this through store growth, market expansion and product extensions. And we have 62 million active customers globally, and we acquired over 60% more online customers than this time last year. And that is a really big deal. We're on a mission to create loyalists. We enrolled more than 5 million customers in our multi-tender loyalty program in Q1. And on average, they are spending far more than customers not in our program. This gives us confidence ahead of our integrated loyalty program launch this summer.
We also announced a new credit card agreement with Barclays and Mastercard that will begin in May 2022. We feel that the level of technology and personalization capabilities that Barclays bring to the partnership fit perfectly with our strategy to use new and more effective ways to speak to our customers.
The Power of our Portfolio also means our brands can drive sustainable change at scale. Old Navy's move to eliminate plastic shopping bags in the U.S. and Canada by 2023 is a meaningful step in our waste reduction efforts. Gap brand's latest Generation Good Collection has the most sustainable tees and denim to date. More than 60% of Banana Republic's 2021 Spring Collection was manufactured using more sustainable fibers. And through its solar power purchase agreement, Athleta brought additional renewable energy to the grid that is helping offset more than 100% of the electricity it uses to power its stores. Finally, our freshly branded company mailer will be made with 50% recycled content, leaving an optimistic first impression on our customer and further reducing our use of virgin plastic.
We choose to see sustainability through an inclusion lens, and these efforts demonstrate our deep belief in empowering women, enabling opportunities and enriching communities, all part of our purpose to be inclusive by design.
Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to touch on our talented team because this is a team effort. We are creating a performance and owner culture for all with shared accountability in our business results. And I want to take a moment to acknowledge and honor a job well done over the last year and quarter, one that was particularly challenging for our frontline team members, 96% of whom maintained loyalty through furloughs and served as a lifeblood of our business through the acute COVID- impacts.
When business is good, we believe vehemently that this is the time to push ourselves harder, to strive for continuous improvement and to reach even further for growth across our brands. Momentum is on our side, and we intend to capitalize. History suggests a spurt of innovation comes out of every crisis and the strength of our brands, platform and portfolio, coupled with our creative audacity, suggests an exciting road ahead.
So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

Sonia, a couple of questions. I guess my first question is on the advertising spend. I know that you're moving from kind of noncustomer-facing SG&A, shifting into kind of demand creation, and we should think about that as probably being in the 6 percentage sales range. And I'm just wondering how you think about that number relative to other companies that have brands that tend to be a little bit higher than that. And then of that spend, how are you thinking about proportioning it among the different brands?
And then for Katrina, can you give us either a line of sight of where Gap and BR are trending now for operating margin? Or alternatively, when you get to the 10% margin, what is the target for those 2 pieces of the business?"

I mean we'll see where revenue is. But that is -- it will be sort of lumpy by quarter. And as we said in the speech, we are going to lean a little bit more into Q2. We actually didn't hit the 6% marketing in Q1. And so we did sort of reserve some of that money for Q2 to invest in back-to-school, as we said, and the loyalty launch. So it's going to be lumpy, but I think 6% is about what we're thinking and we'll see. Sonia may or may not have said, a lot of our marketing is digital. We can read it week to week. It's very flexible, and so we'll lean in as appropriate.
With regards to operating margin, we haven't broken those out by brand. I think we've acknowledged that Old Navy and Athleta are the highest operating margins. But certainly, the restructuring at Gap and Banana is intended to really take out the lack of profitability at those brands and bring them back up. All of that's contemplated in various scenarios in the 10% operating margin goal, and we haven't really said more than that."

So specific to Old Navy, they're really seeing strength on the distortion on product and the acceleration of comfort and cozy, whether it's the fleece and active dominance that they've seen, and really big growth there, triple-digit growth. With the resurgence in the lifestyle products such as dresses and shorts, it's really this power of the ""and"", right? The family is wanting all of these choices from Old Navy. So the product acceleration between those big end uses, and you couple it with the kids and baby dominance that Old Navy has as the #1 brand in the kids and baby space, all of that yields really, really great execution on product.
And then they've deployed excellent new pricing strategies this quarter as well that you'll see in stores and online with Everyday Magic pricing, which has allowed day in/day out pricing for about 20% of the assortment. We see this as growing. We see this as something customers are really responding to, and it's enabled the margin expansion on top of the product acceptance. And then the innovation that's happening in the site has really maintained our e-commerce momentum. As you know, technology investment is a big deal for us. That's manifesting in a stronger momentum in the e-commerce business. The loyalty enablement, we know how much more customer spend with loyalty. So those technology and loyalty investments are paying off and building.
And then lastly, I'd say the stores' recovery from the COVID time has been fantastic, and customers are loving the experience. They want a physical shopping space where the family can come and really have something that is human centered, and that's what they're experiencing in the stores, so they're happy to be back, and we're happy to have them."

So when I think about margin for the year, what I would say is the rent and occupancy leverage that we're seeing is largely on track based on the work we've done to shut the North America stores and get the lease renegotiations that we worked so hard on last year. And so I would say about 75% or 80% of that 430 bps we saw in Q1 would continue for the year and continue to add significant value to our margin expansion.
And then on the product margin side, as Sonia said, we're really pleased with the way our brands are competing. And whether that's the right product, the right creative, the right brand values, the right marketing, all of that is giving us the power to pull back on discounting. In Q1, that allowed us to offset shipping. And we'll see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But certainly, we expect product margins should continue to be higher on a year-over-year basis.
What we're watching, honestly, on the margin side of things is what everyone I think has talked about, which is whether supply chain issues will require air freight in order to be able to continue to get inventory here, whether there will be commodity pressures in the back half. We'll see how all that plays out. We've been navigating that closely and using our advantaged supply chain to help us mitigate what we can. But certainly, all of that's on our minds as we think about the back half of the year. But all those scenarios are reflected in the 6% operating margin. And I think as we said on the call, we had originally expected 5% this year. We're now guiding to 6%. And so all of that feels like we're accelerating towards our 10% plan. And we're proud of that."

The Yeezy Gap is a work in progress and remains a significant opportunity for us. And will it be Q2 or Q3, we'll see. What I can tell you is that the creativity is through the roof, and it's spilling over to the brand. And it's inspiring our teams more broadly. So we are very energized by what we're seeing, and we know our customers will be, too. We're planning for a multiyear effect here, a multiyear business. So we're confident in that potential.

Honestly, what we don't know is as the vendors are more impacted by the COVID outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia and as those orders transpire and we start to see what happens there, we don't know yet how much we will or won't have to air in order to get that here or if there will be freight implications. So I can't say, honestly. Again, we're looking closely at all of that and working hard to do what we've been doing, which is use our pricing power to offset all of those issues.

We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings p",2648,"Thank you, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings per share. 
Our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands are competing well, gaining share and expanding gross margins, driven by strong product and creative execution and digital dominance. And we're making progress on our transformation initiatives that are critical to our goal of growing sales profitably and expanding operating margins. We're optimistic that the consumer will remain strong, particularly in the U.S. and that our iconic brands, well-located stores and digital advantage will remain relevant as consumers transition back to work and school. And while our business did benefit from stimulus spending in Q1 as well as a faster recovery due to accelerated vaccine deployment, we're very pleased with the way we leveraged our competitive advantages, our brands, our portfolio and our platform to win this quarter. 
With that, let me share a few highlights from the quarter that demonstrate our continued progress against our Power Plan 2023 strategy, starting with delivering sales growth. 
First, our revenue grew 8% versus 2019. We're pleased with this strong performance, recognizing it includes nearly 5 points of impact from our strategic North America store closure plan over that time period as well as roughly 2 points of impact from COVID-related store closures outside of the U.S. Our U.S. market share is the highest we've seen in recent years at 5.5%, up 90 basis points versus last year. At nearly $4 billion, this was the largest Q1 revenue in the company's history. 
We're happy with the standout performance of Old Navy and Athleta, which grew net sales 27% and 56%, respectively, in Q1 versus 2019. Combined, Old Navy and Athleta represented 66% of company sales in Q1, moving closer to our target of 70% by the end of 2023. Sonia will talk more about how they compete to win a little bit later. 
There's also a meaningful progress at Gap brand. Gap North America delivered a 9% comp versus 2019, underscoring the progress the brand is making in the product and operations of its core business. The brand has become more digitally led and is realizing the margin benefit of closing unprofitable stores while also reinvigorating the brand with great creative and product execution. 
And lastly, we're excited about the changes occurring at Banana Republic: its updated product design, realigned pricing architecture, in-store experience and updated brand creative. While we aren't yet seeing growth at Banana Republic, the team is focused on regaining relevance and repositioning Banana Republic for a post-COVID world. 
Our commitment to becoming a digitally led company is paying off. At over $6 billion in sales in fiscal 2020, our online channel was ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales and, when leveraged with our well-located fleet, gives us strategic advantage in serving our customers through an omnichannel lens. And in Q1, online momentum continued with sales growth up 82% versus 2019, ending the quarter at 40% of total sales compared to 25% in 2019. 
Next, we're strategically driving down fixed costs and reallocating a portion to demand generation in support of our sales growth. Several expense levers, strategic store closures and productivity and operating expenses, especially in stores, have helped us weather pandemic-related costs in the quarter and allowed us to lean into demand-generating investments, such as marketing and digital enhancements. Our strategic investment in marketing over the last several quarters has helped us gain market share in the dislocated apparel market, and we're leveraging that share consolidation to drive growth now. 
We've driven improvement in product margins over the last few quarters as customers have responded to our brand-building marketing. In addition, we've delivered creative execution and relevant product, supporting higher regular price selling and reduced discounts. While freight and shipping costs as well as pandemic-related supply chain headwinds persist, this margin expansion provided an offset against these rising costs. 
Our fleet rationalization is on track and driving significant economic value. I'll share more details in a moment, but we remain on track to closing 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023. Higher online sales, store closures, both in the quarter and last year; along with lease negotiations and abatement settlements, contributed 430 basis points of ROD leverage in Q1 versus 2019. 
We're making progress on leveraging partnerships as a capital-efficient way to amplify our iconic brands and drive profitable sales, particularly at Gap brand. Yesterday, the brand announced an exclusive deal with Walmart.com to deliver Gap Home. Sonia will speak more about this later, but this is an example of how, through partnerships, we can extend the reach of our brands to customers across product categories, markets and channels. 
Our strategic review of our European market presence is underway. We're evaluating options across France, Italy, the U.K. and Ireland. Gap brand has a strong brand recognition in Europe and whether through a franchise model or online, we look forward to providing Gap products to our European customers. We'll share more progress on our evaluation as we move through the year. 
As part of our Power Plan 2023, we committed to profitably growing our $4 billion lifestyle brand. In support of this strategic initiative, we completed the sale of our Janie and Jack business in the first quarter and completed the sale of the Intermix business early in the second quarter. While these transactions won't materially affect EBIT, the brands together contributed approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. This change further enables management to focus on the core brands and remove fixed costs in the portfolio. 
And finally, we've generated meaningful free cash flow, ending the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet supports our investment for growth in 2021 through capital expenditures while also resuming our long-standing practice of returning cash to shareholders. 
We initiated a new dividend in the second quarter and are returning to our program of share repurchases intended to offset dilution. We're also closely monitoring our debt position. Based on current market prices of our notes, we don't believe it's in the best interest of shareholders to repurchase or restructure at this time. While we're not planning any near-term actions related to our debt, we are actively watching the markets and interest rates so we can take action at the appropriate time. 
Before I move on to our revised 2021 outlook, I want to say I'm proud of how the team leaned into our competitive advantages, maximizing our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value. As we look to the balance of 2021, despite the remaining uncertainty related to the COVID pandemic, our first quarter performance gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook today. On a reported basis, the company now anticipates full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, we're raising our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75. 
So let me turn to our Q1 financials and starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter were $4 billion, up 8% versus 2019. Comp sales were up 28% versus a year ago and up 13% versus 2019. While overall performance was quite good, Q1 sales were negatively impacted by the continued resurgence in the COVID pandemic that resulted in unplanned mandated store closures and restrictions across Canada, Japan, China and Europe. As noted, the pandemic-related impact to first quarter sales versus 2019 is estimated to be approximately 2 percentage points. In addition, the sales decline related to strategically planned permanent store closures had an estimated impact of about 5 percentage points versus 2019. 
Overall store sales in Q1 were down 16% versus 2019. The decline in store sales is attributable to an estimated 7 points of sales impact from permanent closures and an estimated 3 points of sales impact from international market, COVID-mandated closures. Our online sales grew 82% versus 2019 and contributed 40% of sales in the quarter. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings release. 
Turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin rate was 40.8%, leveraging 450 basis points versus 2019. Our margin expansion is as follows. ROD leveraged 430 basis points versus 2019 due to the increase in online sales, coupled with savings from store closures and rent negotiations. Merchandise margins expanded 20 basis points versus 2019, reflecting higher product margin due to lower promotional activities, offsetting approximately 200 basis points of higher shipping costs associated with increased online sales. 
Turning to SG&A. First quarter reported operating expenses were $1.4 billion and 34.8% of sales. Excluding $56 million in charges related to divestiture activity in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses were $1.3 billion or 33.4% of sales, deleveraging 60 basis points versus Q1 2019 adjusted SG&A. This 60 basis points of deleverage is due to the following dynamics: deleverage of 120 basis points due to elevated compensation costs as part of the company's pay-for-performance philosophy; higher distribution center costs of 40 basis points in support of the company's online expansion; and importantly, productivity and store expenses of 230 basis points were partially redeployed into demand generation as marketing investment was higher and deleveraged 140 basis points. The greater investment and demand generation resulted in 0.9 point of market share gain for Gap, Inc. in Q1 versus a year ago, ending the quarter at 5.5% of total U.S. apparel market share. 
Turning to operating margin. On a reported basis, first quarter total operating income was $240 million or 6% of sales. On an adjusted basis, first quarter operating income totaled $296 million with operating margin of 7.4%, expanding 390 basis points versus adjusted 2019 operating margin. 
Moving to taxes and interest. The reported effective tax rate was 11.2% for the first quarter. The lower first quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the onetime income tax benefit related to divestiture activity in the quarter. Excluding this impact, the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. And first quarter net interest expense was $53 million. 
Turning to EPS. Our first quarter reported earnings per share was $0.43. Excluding charges related to divestiture activity, adjusted earnings per share was $0.48. 
To provide some perspective on inventory, total inventory was up 6% versus the first quarter of 2019 and up 7% versus the year ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to COVID-related U.S. port congestion and the impact on shipping lanes, resulting in higher in-transit inventory levels. Importantly, we remain pleased with the content of our inventory, with markdown ownership below 2020 and 2019, and are confident in our ability to deliver product margins above last year's levels in Q2. We now expect Q2 inventory growth versus 2020 to be in the range of high single digits to mid-teens, acknowledging the volatility regarding COVID-related supply chain disruptions impacting in-transit inventory levels. 
Moving to real estate and store closures. In the first quarter, we closed 6 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America, consistent with our strategy of improving the profitability of our store fleet. We still anticipate closing approximately 75 stores in 2021, which will bring us to approximately 75% of our goal of closing 350 stores in North America by the end of 2023. We anticipate that store closures in 2021 will be weighted towards the back half of the year based on the timing of lease expirations. In addition, on a net basis, we opened 25 Old Navy and Athleta stores, consistent with our plans to expand their customer reach. 
During the quarter, we incurred store-related cash outlays of about $6 million for North America. In 2021, we continue to estimate cash outlays of about $135 million related to store closures. As noted previously, as of the end of 2023, we expect that the full store rationalization program will yield annualized pretax savings of about $100 million. This estimate does not include the strategic review of our Europe market, which remains in progress. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow was $216 million in the quarter. As a result of the company's strong cash flow performance, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company ended the quarter with 377 million shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to Sonia, let me touch on our financial outlook for 2021, which we are raising across all key measures. We believe the biggest domestic impact from the pandemic is largely behind us, with the U.S. market showing signs of strength driven by stimulus in Q1 and a faster recovery from the accelerated vaccine rollout. While we are seeing a healthier macro environment in the U.S., we expect lingering impacts to continue globally as seen in market closures and stay-at-home restrictions in Canada, China, Japan and Europe. In addition, while our strategies are working and showing good results, we're also watching the evolving pressures on our supply chain from both COVID outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia as well as the ongoing raw material supply pressures. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide the following revised guidance for fiscal year 2021. On a reported basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Q1 charges associated with the divestiture activity, we now expect our earnings per share -- adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75, a $0.40 increase versus prior year outlook. Both our reported and adjusted outlooks exclude the potential impact associated with ongoing strategic reviews in Europe. 
Now let me provide you with some additional guidance metrics for 2021. We are raising our sales outlook and now anticipate full year net sales growth to be in the range of low to mid-20% versus fiscal year 2020. Notably, this revised outlook reflects the lost revenue attributable to the recent sale of Janie and Jack and Intermix which, combined on an annual basis, represented approximately 2% of company sales. 
Our reported and adjusted operating margin guidance is now approximately 6%, an increase from our previous guidance of about 5%. This reflects an acceleration of our progress towards reaching a 10% operating margin by the end of 2023. We anticipate a modestly higher level of SG&A spending as a percentage of sales in Q2 versus Q1. With a disproportionate advantage in back-to-school, primarily at Gap and Old Navy, we plan to invest more heavily in marketing and digital assets to drive market share during this important time. Additionally, the integrated launch of our loyalty program in the fall is supported by elevated investments in customer-facing technology. This modest increase in SG&A spend in Q2 is fully contemplated in the higher operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2021 of about 6%. 
And lastly, I want to note the company's focus on returning cash to shareholders. First, we announced earlier this month that the company will pay a Q2 dividend of $0.12 a share, recognizing the strength of our balance sheet and continuing a long history of paying regular dividends to shareholders. In addition, we'll resume share repurchases with the intent to offset dilution. Subject to market conditions and other considerations, the company expects to repurchase up to $200 million of shares under the program for the remainder of fiscal year 2021. 
In closing, our first quarter performance reflects a strong start to 2021 with profitable sales growth and operating margin expansion versus 2019. This strong start is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook, putting us on an accelerated path to our long-term goals. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Sonia."

And as Katrina mentioned, our sales were up significantly year-over-year and exceeded our 2019 results. 
Our strong performance in Q1 can be attributed to 2 things. First, and most importantly, our Power Plan 2023 is taking hold. And second, the macro tailwinds, which included a third round of stimulus checks and increased vaccine distribution, created an inflection point. 
Our teams are maniacally focused on growing our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands, and our customers are responding. The marketing investments we've made over the last several quarters to fuel demand, coupled with the macro tailwinds, are supercharging our business. The share we strategically took in 2020 during the consolidation in the apparel market drove outsized momentum in Q1, especially in Old Navy and Athleta, and we're feeling great about the health of Gap business in North America. According to NPD, our market share gains outpaced the industry average and, as Katrina shared, were the highest we've seen in recent years. 
Customers are emerging from the pandemic with a newfound appreciation for social connections and a chance to express their style. At the same time, customers are holding on to the comfort they found in the spaces and rituals created over the last year. As store traffic rebounded, we sustained our digital dominance with online growth up 61% year-over-year and 82% when compared to 2019. Growth in active and fleece continued to rise, showing customers' hesitance to let go of the cozy mentality, while we saw a resurgence in dresses and summer fashion as customers also wish for a spring awakening. 
While these trends benefited the entire industry, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the ""and"" factor: joggers and dresses, digital and in-store, stepping out and staying in. Customers are embracing their own blend of ""and"" which allows us to play to our strength. 
While we're pleased with the Q1, and we are seeing great progress in our U.S. market, we understand that the pandemic is far from over on a global scale. With the resurgence in cases in Canada, Europe, China and Japan, COVID impact on demand in international markets is still meaningful. And more critically, due to rising cases in countries we source from, like India, we are facing supply chain and raw material challenges. Still, agility and flexibility and scale have become a strong muscle across the team. And as we monitor and mitigate these headwinds, I'm confident we have the right levers to pull. 
We're on track and feel positive about the progress we're making against our Power Plan 2023. We are taking swift action as needed while shifting investments to grow our iconic brands in new and profitable ways for the long term. 
Let me elaborate on some of Katrina's remarks and walk you through how this showed up this quarter, starting with the Power of our Brands. I'm particularly energized by how each of our brands are demonstrating brand power to compete and take profitable share. I attribute this to having trend-right product, purpose-led marketing and brand-amplifying creative partnerships, resulting in improved brand health and stronger customer relevance. Across our brands, we are harnessing our pricing power, we're reducing promotions and directly investing to drive demand. 
Let me first talk about Old Navy. While the overall market has strengthened, Old Navy is taking share, outpacing the industry. The brand maintains its position as the #2 apparel brand in the U.S. and now sits as the #6 apparel retailer on a rolling 3-month basis according to NPD. The stimulus, consumer optimism, strong product acceptance and full funnel marketing drove a remarkable quarter. Old Navy stores delivered profitable growth even with COVID closures. And at the same time, our online growth continued to accelerate. Newly acquired customers are spending more, thanks to marketing investments in brand-building storytelling, like their Vintage Vibes campaign, which tapped into today's TikTok generation. 
In their most recent campaign, Old Navy teamed up with NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson to share the success stories of 3 inspiring graduates from our career skills and mentoring program, This Way ONward. Growth in key categories like active and fleece remains strong, while seasonal categories like dresses, shorts and denim are coming back. Strength in stores and the shift in product mix signal a new stage in pandemic recovery as vaccines roll out, enabling the return of family vacations and in-person learning. Old Navy anticipates distorted share acquisition in kids and baby from distressed retailers and, when paired with customer exuberance, sets us up for a strong back-to-school performance. 
Building on a successful sleepwear business, Old Navy extended into intimates in April to further deliver on the needs of our customers' full lives and, since the launch, has picked up 0.5 point of market share and moved into the top 20 intimates retailers. We're also looking forward to the brand's expansion of inclusive sizing to all stores later this year. With one of the broadest size ranges in the industry, but largely limited to online, this serves to further its commitment to the democracy of style and better serve our existing plus customers with a physical space to shop and engage with us. 
Next, Gap. Momentum accelerated in Q1 with modern American optimism coming to life through improved product, evolving and clear creative direction and overall sharper execution. While COVID-related closures in Asia and Europe impacted sales meaningfully in the quarter, Gap North America is growing, healthy and cool, delivering a positive 9% 2-year comp with margin expansion. The team is focused on building relevance in the U.S. which, in turn, gives us the power to export that relevance globally. 
Gap's Generation Good campaign featured passionate teen activists and self-defined creators who are forging a positive and inclusive path forward, and that resonated deeply with customers. And they are responding to Gap's effortless style, driving lower discounting and giving the brand pricing power. 
Priority categories active, sleep and fleece accelerated, resulting in double-digit sales growth versus Q1 2019. And like Old Navy, kids and baby sales were strong as many kids returned to the classroom, they grew, and it all bodes well for a strong back-to-school season later this summer. 
Work is underway on the Yeezy Gap collaboration with Kanye West. Again, we're approaching this launch with deep intention, and we expect to share more with you in the next few months. 
And as we announced today, we're optimistic about our venture into home with the launch of Gap Home at Walmart.com this summer. $164 billion category in the U.S. alone, home is a natural extension of apparel and a category where storytelling drives sales, both a natural fit as we build lifestyle brands. Leveraging our model of partnering to amplify, the Gap and Walmart partnership is a capital-efficient alternative to acquiring capabilities in-house. The assortment is sustainably made, beautifully curated, incredibly priced, and we cannot wait to see Gap's modern American optimism translated to home and kids' dorm rooms later this year. 
Turning to Banana Republic. The new team at Banana Republic is making progress, laying the foundation for its transformation. Over the quarter, they've made strides in realigning their pricing architecture and yield management, improving the physical in-store experience and updating brand creative. To restore brand relevance, the team has identified both target customer groups and the core cultural trends to inform our new brand positioning, our new product design and our customer engagement approach. 
Banana Republic showed off stunning floral windows to welcome spring ahead of the launch of a capsule collection by the emerging designer, Prep Curry, who mixes streetwear with bold florals and dual-gender style. This collection largely sold out in under a week, showing the demand we can create through limited edition partnerships. Laying the path for the future will take time, and we are steadfast in our mission to reestablish Banana Republic's marketplace position as a leading, affordable luxury lifestyle brand. 
Now what a quarter for Athleta. Athleta drove outsized digital growth while achieving record full-price sales through gains in performance lifestyle products, particularly warm weather shorts, dresses, swim and tanks. And it really differentiates us from the competition. Performance of inclusive sizing has grown steadily since its January launch, with 70% of the Athleta collection now available in 1X to 3X. 
Athleta had some really major wins in its effort to raise brand awareness by amplifying our values. The All Powerful campaign drove overwhelmingly positive engagement at 2x the industry benchmarks with impressions across print and digital totaling over 160 million. And Athleta will have 2 gold metal athletes at the world stage in Tokyo this summer who will amplify the brand's mission to empower women and girls. Simone Biles joins Allyson Felix as the brand's newest ambassador and will bring her personal story of unparalleled career achievement, along with her journey of pushing through pain and adversity. These value-led partnerships are driving the awareness of Athleta. And in fact, when we announced our partnership with Simone Biles, Athleta had the highest non-holiday search result in their history. 
Investments in digital are paying off with app performance exceeding expectations, and success in digital marketing is driving new customer growth to historic highs, pushing Athleta's total customer file to 4.5 million in Q1. Athleta also announced plans to open stores in Canada later this year, joining Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic. With an online site launch later this summer and 2 stores planned for fall, this move is proof point in our strategy to extend customers' access through new entry points. 
Our vision to grow purpose-led, billion-dollar lifestyle brands is taking hold. And as Katrina mentioned earlier, we're transforming our brand portfolio to align with our Power Plan 2023. We successfully wound down Hill City and divested Janie and Jack and Intermix. These moves allow us to focus and prioritize our strategic intent and put resources behind the brands with the most potential and that generate the most sales. 
Next, the Power of our Platform. Our digitally-led mindset is paying off with our dominant omnichannel strength and scaled operations. Online sales grew nearly 60% versus the first quarter of last year and represented approximately 40% of the total business even as sales rebounded in stores. And our omni team delivered the largest March on record, shipping 13 million packages to customers in North America. 
As I shared last quarter, one of our main priorities in 2021 is optimizing our mobile experience. We launched our Android native app in March, and we're excited to be engaging with our Android customers. And strong contribution from our alternative payment providers, PayPal and Afterpay, represented 20% of online spend in Q1. 
With our leading omni platform, whether in stores or on mobile, through curbside pickup or our self-checkout pilot coming later this year, we're pushing for convenience and engaging experiences across the entire customer journey. 
We are laser-focused on our SG&A transformation through increased productivity, organizational capacity and demand-generating investments. We're on track to close North America stores across Gap and Banana Republic, in line with our strategy of releasing unproductive sales. And the strategic review of our European business is still underway. 
Finally, the Power of our Portfolio. We're using our brands' collective power to grow our customer file and extend brand reach. I've shared several ways our brands are doing this through store growth, market expansion and product extensions. And we have 62 million active customers globally, and we acquired over 60% more online customers than this time last year. And that is a really big deal. We're on a mission to create loyalists. We enrolled more than 5 million customers in our multi-tender loyalty program in Q1. And on average, they are spending far more than customers not in our program. This gives us confidence ahead of our integrated loyalty program launch this summer. 
We also announced a new credit card agreement with Barclays and Mastercard that will begin in May 2022. We feel that the level of technology and personalization capabilities that Barclays bring to the partnership fit perfectly with our strategy to use new and more effective ways to speak to our customers. 
The Power of our Portfolio also means our brands can drive sustainable change at scale. Old Navy's move to eliminate plastic shopping bags in the U.S. and Canada by 2023 is a meaningful step in our waste reduction efforts. Gap brand's latest Generation Good Collection has the most sustainable tees and denim to date. More than 60% of Banana Republic's 2021 Spring Collection was manufactured using more sustainable fibers. And through its solar power purchase agreement, Athleta brought additional renewable energy to the grid that is helping offset more than 100% of the electricity it uses to power its stores. Finally, our freshly branded company mailer will be made with 50% recycled content, leaving an optimistic first impression on our customer and further reducing our use of virgin plastic. 
We choose to see sustainability through an inclusion lens, and these efforts demonstrate our deep belief in empowering women, enabling opportunities and enriching communities, all part of our purpose to be inclusive by design. 
Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to touch on our talented team because this is a team effort. We are creating a performance and owner culture for all with shared accountability in our business results. And I want to take a moment to acknowledge and honor a job well done over the last year and quarter, one that was particularly challenging for our frontline team members, 96% of whom maintained loyalty through furloughs and served as a lifeblood of our business through the acute COVID impact. 
When business is good, we believe vehemently that this is the time to push ourselves harder, to strive for continuous improvement and to reach even further for growth across our brands. Momentum is on our side, and we intend to capitalize. History suggests a spurt of innovation comes out of every crisis and the strength of our brands, platform and portfolio, coupled with our creative audacity, suggests an exciting road ahead. 
So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And I'm just wondering how you think about that number relative to other companies that have brands that tend to be a little bit higher than that. And then of that spend, how are you thinking about proportioning it among the different brands? 
And then for Katrina, can you give us either a line of sight of where Gap and BR are trending now for operating margin? Or alternatively, when you get to the 10% margin, what is the target for those 2 pieces of the business?"

But we're learning, and we'll continue to see what we hear back from customers on some of those investments. Right now, we're seeing a really great virtuous cycle with the investments in marketing allowing us to improve our price realization across all of our brands."

I mean we'll see where revenue is. But that is -- it will be sort of lumpy by quarter. And as we said in the speech, we are going to lean a little bit more into Q2. We actually didn't hit the 6% marketing in Q1. And so we did sort of reserve some of that money for Q2 to invest in back-to-school, as we said, and the loyalty launch. So it's going to be lumpy, but I think 6% is about what we're thinking and we'll see. Sonia may or may not have said, a lot of our marketing is digital. We can read it week to week. It's very flexible, and so we'll lean in as appropriate. 
With regards to operating margin, we haven't broken those out by brand. I think we've acknowledged that Old Navy and Athleta are the highest operating margins. But certainly, the restructuring at Gap and Banana is intended to really take out the lack of profitability at those brands and bring them back up. All of that's contemplated in various scenarios in the 10% operating margin goal, and we haven't really said more than that."

So specific to Old Navy, they're really seeing strength on the distortion on product and the acceleration of comfort and cozy, whether it's the fleece and active dominance that they've seen, and really big growth there, triple-digit growth. With the resurgence in the lifestyle products such as dresses and shorts, it's really this power of the ""and"", right? The family is wanting all of these choices from Old Navy. So the product acceleration between those big end uses, and you couple it with the kids and baby dominance that Old Navy has as the #1 brand in the kids and baby space, all of that yields really, really great execution on product. 
And then they've deployed excellent new pricing strategies this quarter as well that you'll see in stores and online with Everyday Magic pricing, which has allowed day in/day out pricing for about 20% of the assortment. We see this as growing. We see this as something customers are really responding to, and it's enabled the margin expansion on top of the product acceptance. And then the innovation that's happening in the site has really maintained our e-commerce momentum. As you know, technology investment is a big deal for us. That's manifesting in a stronger momentum in the e-commerce business. The loyalty enablement, we know how much more customer spend with loyalty. So those technology and loyalty investments are paying off and building. 
And then lastly, I'd say the stores' recovery from the COVID time has been fantastic, and customers are loving the experience. They want a physical shopping space where the family can come and really have something that is human centered, and that's what they're experiencing in the stores, so they're happy to be back, and we're happy to have them."

So when I think about margin for the year, what I would say is the rent and occupancy leverage that we're seeing is largely on track based on the work we've done to shut the North America stores and get the lease renegotiations that we worked so hard on last year. And so I would say about 75% or 80% of that 430 bps we saw in Q1 would continue for the year and continue to add significant value to our margin expansion. 
And then on the product margin side, as Sonia said, we're really pleased with the way our brands are competing. And whether that's the right product, the right creative, the right brand values, the right marketing, all of that is giving us the power to pull back on discounting. In Q1, that allowed us to offset shipping. And we'll see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But certainly, we expect product margins should continue to be higher on a year-over-year basis. 
What we're watching, honestly, on the margin side of things is what everyone I think has talked about, which is whether supply chain issues will require air freight in order to be able to continue to get inventory here, whether there will be commodity pressures in the back half. We'll see how all that plays out. We've been navigating that closely and using our advantaged supply chain to help us mitigate what we can. But certainly, all of that's on our minds as we think about the back half of the year. But all those scenarios are reflected in the 6% operating margin. And I think as we said on the call, we had originally expected 5% this year. We're now guiding to 6%. And so all of that feels like we're accelerating towards our 10% plan. And we're proud of that."

And every day with customers and across social media, we see the hype building from speculation around the product to supposed launch dates. 
The Yeezy Gap is a work in progress and remains a significant opportunity for us. And will it be Q2 or Q3, we'll see. What I can tell you is that the creativity is through the roof, and it's spilling over to the brand. And it's inspiring our teams more broadly. So we are very energized by what we're seeing, and we know our customers will be, too. We're planning for a multiyear effect here, a multiyear business. So we're confident in that potential.

So I can't say, honestly. Again, we're looking closely at all of that and working hard to do what we've been doing, which is use our pricing power to offset all of those issues.

We're very pleased with our first quarter results and especially pleased that our performance is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook on sales, operating margin and earnings per share. 
Our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands are competing well, gaining share and expanding gross margins, driven by strong product and creative execution and digital dominance. And we're making progress on our transformation initiatives that are critical to our goal of growing sales profitably and expanding operating margins. We're optimistic that the consumer will remain strong, particularly in the U.S. and that our iconic brands, well-located stores and digital advantage will remain relevant as consumers transition back to work and school. And while our business did benefit from stimulus spending in Q1 as well as a faster recovery due to accelerated vaccine deployment, we're very pleased with the way we leveraged our competitive advantages, our brands, our portfolio and our platform to win this quarter. 
With that, let me share a few highlights from the quarter that demonstrate our continued progress against our Power Plan 2023 strategy, starting with delivering sales growth. 
First, our revenue grew 8% versus 2019. We're pleased with this strong performance, recognizing it includes nearly 5 points of impact from our strategic North America store closure plan over that time period as well as roughly 2 points of impact from COVID-related store closures outside of the U.S. Our U.S. market share is the highest we've seen in recent years at 5.5%, up 90 basis points versus last year. At nearly $4 billion, this was the largest Q1 revenue in the company's history. 
We're happy with the standout performance of Old Navy and Athleta, which grew net sales 27% and 56%, respectively, in Q1 versus 2019. Combined, Old Navy and Athleta represented 66% of company sales in Q1, moving closer to our target of 70% by the end of 2023. Sonia will talk more about how they compete to win a little bit later. 
There's also a meaningful progress at Gap brand. Gap North America delivered a 9% comp versus 2019, underscoring the progress the brand is making in the product and operations of its core business. The brand has become more digitally led and is realizing the margin benefit of closing unprofitable stores while also reinvigorating the brand with great creative and product execution. 
And lastly, we're excited about the changes occurring at Banana Republic: its updated product design, realigned pricing architecture, in-store experience and updated brand creative. While we aren't yet seeing growth at Banana Republic, the team is focused on regaining relevance and repositioning Banana Republic for a post-COVID world. 
Our commitment to becoming a digitally led company is paying off. At over $6 billion in sales in fiscal 2020, our online channel was ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales and, when leveraged with our well-located fleet, gives us strategic advantage in serving our customers through an omnichannel lens. And in Q1, online momentum continued with sales growth up 82% versus 2019, ending the quarter at 40% of total sales compared to 25% in 2019. 
Next, we're strategically driving down fixed costs and reallocating a portion to demand generation in support of our sales growth. Several expense levers, strategic store closures and productivity and operating expenses, especially in stores, have helped us weather pandemic-related costs in the quarter and allowed us to lean into demand-generating investments, such as marketing and digital enhancements. Our strategic investment in marketing over the last several quarters has helped us gain market share in the dislocated apparel market, and we're leveraging that share consolidation to drive growth now. 
We've driven improvement in product margins over the last few quarters as customers have responded to our brand-building marketing. In addition, we've delivered creative execution and relevant product, supporting higher regular price selling and reduced discounts. While freight and shipping costs as well as pandemic-related supply chain headwinds persist, this margin expansion provided an offset against these rising costs. 
Our fleet rationalization is on track and driving significant economic value. I'll share more details in a moment, but we remain on track to closing 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023. Higher online sales, store closures, both in the quarter and last year; along with lease negotiations and abatement settlements, contributed 430 basis points of ROD leverage in Q1 versus 2019. 
We're making progress on leveraging partnerships as a capital-efficient way to amplify our iconic brands and drive profitable sales, particularly at Gap brand. Yesterday, the brand announced an exclusive deal with Walmart.com to deliver Gap Home. Sonia will speak more about this later, but this is an example of how, through partnerships, we can extend the reach of our brands to customers across product categories, markets and channels. 
Our strategic review of our European market presence is underway. We're evaluating options across France, Italy, the U.K. and Ireland. Gap brand has a strong brand recognition in Europe and whether through a franchise model or online, we look forward to providing Gap products to our European customers. We'll share more progress on our evaluation as we move through the year. 
As part of our Power Plan 2023, we committed to profitably growing our $4 billion lifestyle brand. In support of this strategic initiative, we completed the sale of our Janie and Jack business in the first quarter and completed the sale of the Intermix business early in the second quarter. While these transactions won't materially affect EBIT, the brands together contributed approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. This change further enables management to focus on the core brands and remove fixed costs in the portfolio. 
And finally, we've generated meaningful free cash flow, ending the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet supports our investment for growth in 2021 through capital expenditures while also resuming our long-standing practice of returning cash to shareholders. 
We initiated a new dividend in the second quarter and are returning to our program of share repurchases intended to offset dilution. We're also closely monitoring our debt position. Based on current market prices of our notes, we don't believe it's in the best interest of shareholders to repurchase or restructure at this time. While we're not planning any near-term actions related to our debt, we are actively watching the markets and interest rates so we can take action at the appropriate time. 
Before I move on to our revised 2021 outlook, I want to say I'm proud of how the team leaned into our competitive advantages, maximizing our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value. As we look to the balance of 2021, despite the remaining uncertainty related to the COVID pandemic, our first quarter performance gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook today. On a reported basis, the company now anticipates full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, we're raising our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75. 
So let me turn to our Q1 financials and starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter were $4 billion, up 8% versus 2019. Comp sales were up 28% versus a year ago and up 13% versus 2019. While overall performance was quite good, Q1 sales were negatively impacted by the continued resurgence in the COVID pandemic that resulted in unplanned mandated store closures and restrictions across Canada, Japan, China and Europe. As noted, the pandemic-related impact to first quarter sales versus 2019 is estimated to be approximately 2 percentage points. In addition, the sales decline related to strategically planned permanent store closures had an estimated impact of about 5 percentage points versus 2019. 
Overall store sales in Q1 were down 16% versus 2019. The decline in store sales is attributable to an estimated 7 points of sales impact from permanent closures and an estimated 3 points of sales impact from international market, COVID-mandated closures. Our online sales grew 82% versus 2019 and contributed 40% of sales in the quarter. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings release. 
Turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin rate was 40.8%, leveraging 450 basis points versus 2019. Our margin expansion is as follows. ROD leveraged 430 basis points versus 2019 due to the increase in online sales, coupled with savings from store closures and rent negotiations. Merchandise margins expanded 20 basis points versus 2019, reflecting higher product margin due to lower promotional activities, offsetting approximately 200 basis points of higher shipping costs associated with increased online sales. 
Turning to SG&A. First quarter reported operating expenses were $1.4 billion and 34.8% of sales. Excluding $56 million in charges related to divestiture activity in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses were $1.3 billion or 33.4% of sales, deleveraging 60 basis points versus Q1 2019 adjusted SG&A. This 60 basis points of deleverage is due to the following dynamics: deleverage of 120 basis points due to elevated compensation costs as part of the company's pay-for-performance philosophy; higher distribution center costs of 40 basis points in support of the company's online expansion; and importantly, productivity and store expenses of 230 basis points were partially redeployed into demand generation as marketing investment was higher and deleveraged 140 basis points. The greater investment and demand generation resulted in 0.9 point of market share gain for Gap, Inc. in Q1 versus a year ago, ending the quarter at 5.5% of total U.S. apparel market share. 
Turning to operating margin. On a reported basis, first quarter total operating income was $240 million or 6% of sales. On an adjusted basis, first quarter operating income totaled $296 million with operating margin of 7.4%, expanding 390 basis points versus adjusted 2019 operating margin. 
Moving to taxes and interest. The reported effective tax rate was 11.2% for the first quarter. The lower first quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the onetime income tax benefit related to divestiture activity in the quarter. Excluding this impact, the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. And first quarter net interest expense was $53 million. 
Turning to EPS. Our first quarter reported earnings per share was $0.43. Excluding charges related to divestiture activity, adjusted earnings per share was $0.48. 
To provide some perspective on inventory, total inventory was up 6% versus the first quarter of 2019 and up 7% versus the year ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to COVID-related U.S. port congestion and the impact on shipping lanes, resulting in higher in-transit inventory levels. Importantly, we remain pleased with the content of our inventory, with markdown ownership below 2020 and 2019, and are confident in our ability to deliver product margins above last year's levels in Q2. We now expect Q2 inventory growth versus 2020 to be in the range of high single digits to mid-teens, acknowledging the volatility regarding COVID-related supply chain disruptions impacting in-transit inventory levels. 
Moving to real estate and store closures. In the first quarter, we closed 6 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America, consistent with our strategy of improving the profitability of our store fleet. We still anticipate closing approximately 75 stores in 2021, which will bring us to approximately 75% of our goal of closing 350 stores in North America by the end of 2023. We anticipate that store closures in 2021 will be weighted towards the back half of the year based on the timing of lease expirations. In addition, on a net basis, we opened 25 Old Navy and Athleta stores, consistent with our plans to expand their customer reach. 
During the quarter, we incurred store-related cash outlays of about $6 million for North America. In 2021, we continue to estimate cash outlays of about $135 million related to store closures. As noted previously, as of the end of 2023, we expect that the full store rationalization program will yield annualized pretax savings of about $100 million. This estimate does not include the strategic review of our Europe market, which remains in progress. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow was $216 million in the quarter. As a result of the company's strong cash flow performance, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company ended the quarter with 377 million shares outstanding. 
Before I turn it over to Sonia, let me touch on our financial outlook for 2021, which we are raising across all key measures. We believe the biggest domestic impact from the pandemic is largely behind us, with the U.S. market showing signs of strength driven by stimulus in Q1 and a faster recovery from the accelerated vaccine rollout. While we are seeing a healthier macro environment in the U.S., we expect lingering impacts to continue globally as seen in market closures and stay-at-home restrictions in Canada, China, Japan and Europe. In addition, while our strategies are working and showing good results, we're also watching the evolving pressures on our supply chain from both COVID outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia as well as the ongoing raw material supply pressures. 
With that in mind, I'd like to provide the following revised guidance for fiscal year 2021. On a reported basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70. On an adjusted basis, excluding the Q1 charges associated with the divestiture activity, we now expect our earnings per share -- adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.75, a $0.40 increase versus prior year outlook. Both our reported and adjusted outlooks exclude the potential impact associated with ongoing strategic reviews in Europe. 
Now let me provide you with some additional guidance metrics for 2021. We are raising our sales outlook and now anticipate full year net sales growth to be in the range of low to mid-20% versus fiscal year 2020. Notably, this revised outlook reflects the lost revenue attributable to the recent sale of Janie and Jack and Intermix which, combined on an annual basis, represented approximately 2% of company sales. 
Our reported and adjusted operating margin guidance is now approximately 6%, an increase from our previous guidance of about 5%. This reflects an acceleration of our progress towards reaching a 10% operating margin by the end of 2023. We anticipate a modestly higher level of SG&A spending as a percentage of sales in Q2 versus Q1. With a disproportionate advantage in back-to-school, primarily at Gap and Old Navy, we plan to invest more heavily in marketing and digital assets to drive market share during this important time. Additionally, the integrated launch of our loyalty program in the fall is supported by elevated investments in customer-facing technology. This modest increase in SG&A spend in Q2 is fully contemplated in the higher operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2021 of about 6%. 
And lastly, I want to note the company's focus on returning cash to shareholders. First, we announced earlier this month that the company will pay a Q2 dividend of $0.12 a share, recognizing the strength of our balance sheet and continuing a long history of paying regular dividends to shareholders. In addition, we'll resume share repurchases with the intent to offset dilution. Subject to market conditions and other considerations, the company expects to repurchase up to $200 million of shares under the program for the remainder of fiscal year 2021. 
In closing, our first quarter performance reflects a strong start to 2021 with profitable sales growth and operating margin expansion versus 2019. This strong start is giving us confidence to raise our full year outlook, putting us on an accelerated path to our long-term goals. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Sonia."
274265,713888795,2353360,"The Gap, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to be here today to share our first quarter results. And as Katrina mentioned, our sales were up significantly year-over-year and exceeded our 2019 results. Our strong performance in Q1 can be",2368,"Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to be here today to share our first quarter results. And as Katrina mentioned, our sales were up significantly year-over-year and exceeded our 2019 results. 
Our strong performance in Q1 can be attributed to 2 things. First, and most importantly, our Power Plan 2023 is taking hold. And second, the macro tailwinds, which included a third round of stimulus checks and increased vaccine distribution, created an inflection point. 
Our teams are maniacally focused on growing our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands, and our customers are responding. The marketing investments we've made over the last several quarters to fuel demand, coupled with the macro tailwinds, are supercharging our business. The share we strategically took in 2020 during the consolidation in the apparel market drove outsized momentum in Q1, especially in Old Navy and Athleta, and we're feeling great about the health of Gap business in North America. According to NPD, our market share gains outpaced the industry average and, as Katrina shared, were the highest we've seen in recent years. 
Customers are emerging from the pandemic with a newfound appreciation for social connections and a chance to express their style. At the same time, customers are holding on to the comfort they found in the spaces and rituals created over the last year. As store traffic rebounded, we sustained our digital dominance with online growth up 61% year-over-year and 82% when compared to 2019. Growth in active and fleece continued to rise, showing customers' hesitance to let go of the cozy mentality, while we saw a resurgence in dresses and summer fashion as customers also wish for a spring awakening. 
While these trends benefited the entire industry, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the ""and"" factor: joggers and dresses, digital and in-store, stepping out and staying in. Customers are embracing their own blend of ""and"" which allows us to play to our strength. 
While we're pleased with the Q1, and we are seeing great progress in our U.S. market, we understand that the pandemic is far from over on a global scale. With the resurgence in cases in Canada, Europe, China and Japan, COVID impact on demand in international markets is still meaningful. And more critically, due to rising cases in countries we source from, like India, we are facing supply chain and raw material challenges. Still, agility and flexibility and scale have become a strong muscle across the team. And as we monitor and mitigate these headwinds, I'm confident we have the right levers to pull. 
We're on track and feel positive about the progress we're making against our Power Plan 2023. We are taking swift action as needed while shifting investments to grow our iconic brands in new and profitable ways for the long term. 
Let me elaborate on some of Katrina's remarks and walk you through how this showed up this quarter, starting with the Power of our Brands. I'm particularly energized by how each of our brands are demonstrating brand power to compete and take profitable share. I attribute this to having trend-right product, purpose-led marketing and brand-amplifying creative partnerships, resulting in improved brand health and stronger customer relevance. Across our brands, we are harnessing our pricing power, we're reducing promotions and directly investing to drive demand. 
Let me first talk about Old Navy. While the overall market has strengthened, Old Navy is taking share, outpacing the industry. The brand maintains its position as the #2 apparel brand in the U.S. and now sits as the #6 apparel retailer on a rolling 3-month basis according to NPD. The stimulus, consumer optimism, strong product acceptance and full funnel marketing drove a remarkable quarter. Old Navy stores delivered profitable growth even with COVID closures. And at the same time, our online growth continued to accelerate. Newly acquired customers are spending more, thanks to marketing investments in brand-building storytelling, like their Vintage Vibes campaign, which tapped into today's TikTok generation. 
In their most recent campaign, Old Navy teamed up with NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson to share the success stories of 3 inspiring graduates from our career skills and mentoring program, This Way ONward. Growth in key categories like active and fleece remains strong, while seasonal categories like dresses, shorts and denim are coming back. Strength in stores and the shift in product mix signal a new stage in pandemic recovery as vaccines roll out, enabling the return of family vacations and in-person learning. Old Navy anticipates distorted share acquisition in kids and baby from distressed retailers and, when paired with customer exuberance, sets us up for a strong back-to-school performance. 
Building on a successful sleepwear business, Old Navy extended into intimates in April to further deliver on the needs of our customers' full lives and, since the launch, has picked up 0.5 point of market share and moved into the top 20 intimates retailers. We're also looking forward to the brand's expansion of inclusive sizing to all stores later this year. With one of the broadest size ranges in the industry, but largely limited to online, this serves to further its commitment to the democracy of style and better serve our existing plus customers with a physical space to shop and engage with us. 
Next, Gap. Momentum accelerated in Q1 with modern American optimism coming to life through improved product, evolving and clear creative direction and overall sharper execution. While COVID-related closures in Asia and Europe impacted sales meaningfully in the quarter, Gap North America is growing, healthy and cool, delivering a positive 9% 2-year comp with margin expansion. The team is focused on building relevance in the U.S. which, in turn, gives us the power to export that relevance globally. 
Gap's Generation Good campaign featured passionate teen activists and self-defined creators who are forging a positive and inclusive path forward, and that resonated deeply with customers. And they are responding to Gap's effortless style, driving lower discounting and giving the brand pricing power. 
Priority categories active, sleep and fleece accelerated, resulting in double-digit sales growth versus Q1 2019. And like Old Navy, kids and baby sales were strong as many kids returned to the classroom, they grew, and it all bodes well for a strong back-to-school season later this summer. 
Work is underway on the Yeezy Gap collaboration with Kanye West. Again, we're approaching this launch with deep intention, and we expect to share more with you in the next few months. 
And as we announced today, we're optimistic about our venture into home with the launch of Gap Home at Walmart.com this summer. $164 billion category in the U.S. alone, home is a natural extension of apparel and a category where storytelling drives sales, both a natural fit as we build lifestyle brands. Leveraging our model of partnering to amplify, the Gap and Walmart partnership is a capital-efficient alternative to acquiring capabilities in-house. The assortment is sustainably made, beautifully curated, incredibly priced, and we cannot wait to see Gap's modern American optimism translated to home and kids' dorm rooms later this year. 
Turning to Banana Republic. The new team at Banana Republic is making progress, laying the foundation for its transformation. Over the quarter, they've made strides in realigning their pricing architecture and yield management, improving the physical in-store experience and updating brand creative. To restore brand relevance, the team has identified both target customer groups and the core cultural trends to inform our new brand positioning, our new product design and our customer engagement approach. 
Banana Republic showed off stunning floral windows to welcome spring ahead of the launch of a capsule collection by the emerging designer, Prep Curry, who mixes streetwear with bold florals and dual-gender style. This collection largely sold out in under a week, showing the demand we can create through limited edition partnerships. Laying the path for the future will take time, and we are steadfast in our mission to reestablish Banana Republic's marketplace position as a leading, affordable luxury lifestyle brand. 
Now what a quarter for Athleta. Athleta drove outsized digital growth while achieving record full-price sales through gains in performance lifestyle products, particularly warm weather shorts, dresses, swim and tanks. And it really differentiates us from the competition. Performance of inclusive sizing has grown steadily since its January launch, with 70% of the Athleta collection now available in 1X to 3X. 
Athleta had some really major wins in its effort to raise brand awareness by amplifying our values. The All Powerful campaign drove overwhelmingly positive engagement at 2x the industry benchmarks with impressions across print and digital totaling over 160 million. And Athleta will have 2 gold metal athletes at the world stage in Tokyo this summer who will amplify the brand's mission to empower women and girls. Simone Biles joins Allyson Felix as the brand's newest ambassador and will bring her personal story of unparalleled career achievement, along with her journey of pushing through pain and adversity. These value-led partnerships are driving the awareness of Athleta. And in fact, when we announced our partnership with Simone Biles, Athleta had the highest non-holiday search result in their history. 
Investments in digital are paying off with app performance exceeding expectations, and success in digital marketing is driving new customer growth to historic highs, pushing Athleta's total customer file to 4.5 million in Q1. Athleta also announced plans to open stores in Canada later this year, joining Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic. With an online site launch later this summer and 2 stores planned for fall, this move is proof point in our strategy to extend customers' access through new entry points. 
Our vision to grow purpose-led, billion-dollar lifestyle brands is taking hold. And as Katrina mentioned earlier, we're transforming our brand portfolio to align with our Power Plan 2023. We successfully wound down Hill City and divested Janie and Jack and Intermix. These moves allow us to focus and prioritize our strategic intent and put resources behind the brands with the most potential and that generate the most sales. 
Next, the Power of our Platform. Our digitally-led mindset is paying off with our dominant omnichannel strength and scaled operations. Online sales grew nearly 60% versus the first quarter of last year and represented approximately 40% of the total business even as sales rebounded in stores. And our omni team delivered the largest March on record, shipping 13 million packages to customers in North America. 
As I shared last quarter, one of our main priorities in 2021 is optimizing our mobile experience. We launched our Android native app in March, and we're excited to be engaging with our Android customers. And strong contribution from our alternative payment providers, PayPal and Afterpay, represented 20% of online spend in Q1. 
With our leading omni platform, whether in stores or on mobile, through curbside pickup or our self-checkout pilot coming later this year, we're pushing for convenience and engaging experiences across the entire customer journey. 
We are laser-focused on our SG&A transformation through increased productivity, organizational capacity and demand-generating investments. We're on track to close North America stores across Gap and Banana Republic, in line with our strategy of releasing unproductive sales. And the strategic review of our European business is still underway. 
Finally, the Power of our Portfolio. We're using our brands' collective power to grow our customer file and extend brand reach. I've shared several ways our brands are doing this through store growth, market expansion and product extensions. And we have 62 million active customers globally, and we acquired over 60% more online customers than this time last year. And that is a really big deal. We're on a mission to create loyalists. We enrolled more than 5 million customers in our multi-tender loyalty program in Q1. And on average, they are spending far more than customers not in our program. This gives us confidence ahead of our integrated loyalty program launch this summer. 
We also announced a new credit card agreement with Barclays and Mastercard that will begin in May 2022. We feel that the level of technology and personalization capabilities that Barclays bring to the partnership fit perfectly with our strategy to use new and more effective ways to speak to our customers. 
The Power of our Portfolio also means our brands can drive sustainable change at scale. Old Navy's move to eliminate plastic shopping bags in the U.S. and Canada by 2023 is a meaningful step in our waste reduction efforts. Gap brand's latest Generation Good Collection has the most sustainable tees and denim to date. More than 60% of Banana Republic's 2021 Spring Collection was manufactured using more sustainable fibers. And through its solar power purchase agreement, Athleta brought additional renewable energy to the grid that is helping offset more than 100% of the electricity it uses to power its stores. Finally, our freshly branded company mailer will be made with 50% recycled content, leaving an optimistic first impression on our customer and further reducing our use of virgin plastic. 
We choose to see sustainability through an inclusion lens, and these efforts demonstrate our deep belief in empowering women, enabling opportunities and enriching communities, all part of our purpose to be inclusive by design. 
Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to touch on our talented team because this is a team effort. We are creating a performance and owner culture for all with shared accountability in our business results. And I want to take a moment to acknowledge and honor a job well done over the last year and quarter, one that was particularly challenging for our frontline team members, 96% of whom maintained loyalty through furloughs and served as a lifeblood of our business through the acute COVID impact. 
When business is good, we believe vehemently that this is the time to push ourselves harder, to strive for continuous improvement and to reach even further for growth across our brands. Momentum is on our side, and we intend to capitalize. History suggests a spurt of innovation comes out of every crisis and the strength of our brands, platform and portfolio, coupled with our creative audacity, suggests an exciting road ahead. 
So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

I know that you're moving from kind of noncustomer-facing SG&A, shifting into kind of demand creation, and we should think about that as probably being in the 6% of sales range. And I'm just wondering how you think about that number relative to other companies that have brands that tend to be a little bit higher than that. And then of that spend, how are you thinking about proportioning it among the different brands? 
And then for Katrina, can you give us either a line of sight of where Gap and BR are trending now for operating margin? Or alternatively, when you get to the 10% margin, what is the target for those 2 pieces of the business?"

We actually didn't hit the 6% marketing in Q1. And so we did sort of reserve some of that money for Q2 to invest in back-to-school, as we said, and the loyalty launch. So it's going to be lumpy, but I think 6% is about what we're thinking and we'll see. Sonia may or may not have said, a lot of our marketing is digital. We can read it week to week. It's very flexible, and so we'll lean in as appropriate. 
With regards to operating margin, we haven't broken those out by brand. I think we've acknowledged that Old Navy and Athleta are the highest operating margins. But certainly, the restructuring at Gap and Banana is intended to really take out the lack of profitability at those brands and bring them back up. All of that's contemplated in various scenarios in the 10% operating margin goal, and we haven't really said more than that."

With the resurgence in the lifestyle products such as dresses and shorts, it's really this power of the ""and"", right? The family is wanting all of these choices from Old Navy. So the product acceleration between those big end uses, and you couple it with the kids and baby dominance that Old Navy has as the #1 brand in the kids and baby space, all of that yields really, really great execution on product. 
And then they've deployed excellent new pricing strategies this quarter as well that you'll see in stores and online with Everyday Magic pricing, which has allowed day in/day out pricing for about 20% of the assortment. We see this as growing. We see this as something customers are really responding to, and it's enabled the margin expansion on top of the product acceptance. And then the innovation that's happening in the site has really maintained our e-commerce momentum. As you know, technology investment is a big deal for us. That's manifesting in a stronger momentum in the e-commerce business. The loyalty enablement, we know how much more customer spend with loyalty. So those technology and loyalty investments are paying off and building. 
And then lastly, I'd say the stores' recovery from the COVID time has been fantastic, and customers are loving the experience. They want a physical shopping space where the family can come and really have something that is human centered, and that's what they're experiencing in the stores, so they're happy to be back, and we're happy to have them."

So when I think about margin for the year, what I would say is the rent and occupancy leverage that we're seeing is largely on track based on the work we've done to shut the North America stores and get the lease renegotiations that we worked so hard",311,"Yes. So when I think about margin for the year, what I would say is the rent and occupancy leverage that we're seeing is largely on track based on the work we've done to shut the North America stores and get the lease renegotiations that we worked so hard on last year. And so I would say about 75% or 80% of that 430 bps we saw in Q1 would continue for the year and continue to add significant value to our margin expansion. 
And then on the product margin side, as Sonia said, we're really pleased with the way our brands are competing. And whether that's the right product, the right creative, the right brand values, the right marketing, all of that is giving us the power to pull back on discounting. In Q1, that allowed us to offset shipping. And we'll see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But certainly, we expect product margins should continue to be higher on a year-over-year basis. 
What we're watching, honestly, on the margin side of things is what everyone I think has talked about, which is whether supply chain issues will require air freight in order to be able to continue to get inventory here, whether there will be commodity pressures in the back half. We'll see how all that plays out. We've been navigating that closely and using our advantaged supply chain to help us mitigate what we can. But certainly, all of that's on our minds as we think about the back half of the year. But all those scenarios are reflected in the 6% operating margin. And I think as we said on the call, we had originally expected 5% this year. We're now guiding to 6%. And so all of that feels like we're accelerating towards our 10% plan. And we're proud of that."

The Yeezy Gap is a work in progress and remains a significant opportunity for us. And will it be Q2 or Q3, we'll see. What I can tell you is that the creativity is through the roof, and it's spilling over to the brand. And it's inspiring our teams more broadly. So we are very energized by what we're seeing, and we know our customers will be, too. We're planning for a multiyear effect here, a multiyear business. So we're confident in that potential.

And then as far as shipping costs, we disclosed that we experienced about 200 basis points of shipping headwinds in the quarter. I think that's a reasonable amount to assume for the rest of the year. Honestly, what we don't know is as the vendors are more impacted by the COVID outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia and as those orders transpire and we start to see what happens there, we don't know yet how much we will or won't have to air in order to get that here or if there will be freight implications. So I can't say, honestly. Again, we're looking closely at all of that and working hard to do what we've been doing, which is use our pricing power to offset all of those issues. But again, we're watching all of that closely like everyone and doing our best. But the normal operations, I think that 200 bps is a good estimate."

We're seeing moms and a lot of teenagers join us, join the brand for the first time through the active business. So we are seeing more new and younger customers.

Then I'll turn it over to Katrina to give a more detailed view of our financials and outlook for the rest of the year. 
We're happy with the strong top and bottom line results we delivered this quarter. We grew comparable sales by 12% versus 2019 and delivered the highest Q2 sales in over a decade, even after walking away from 8% of unproductive sales from the divestiture of the 2 smaller brands and the strategic store closures at our North American market. To the entire team, thank you for your commitment to our customers and our company every day. 
Our customers in great summer with optimism, hungry for mood-boosting clothes as vacations and reunions became reality. We saw a celebration of American style of '90s nostalgia and the resurgence of denim. All of these sits in a sweet spot across our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands. Staying close with our customer and keenly observing their cues allowed us to react quickly to the shift in trends. While there's still a favorable consumer environment, we were pleased to maintain our momentum and believe this is a strong indication that our strategy is working. 
Starting with the power of our brand. Over the last several quarters, we've mentioned an increasing investment in marketing and brand amplifying partnership. Our investments, at about 6% of sales for the year, is roughly 50% higher than historic levels, all deployed against fueling demand for each of our brands. We've dialed up marketing efforts by balancing art and science to grow market share to acquire new customers and drive profitable growth. First is art. Fueled by new creative confidence, our brands are using their unique voices, optimism, values and cultural relevance to connect with customers rather than relying on discounts to drive the quick simple steps. Whether it's Old Navy and Grammy-nominated recording artist, H.E.R., celebrating the reopening of America or Gap turning to TikTok fans to choose the next color for its iconic logo hoodie after a viral come back of the classics or Banana Republic tapping into '80s nostalgia and our shared desire to get back out into the world with their recent vintage and travel-inspired capital collections or Athleta and Simone Biles partnering to help girls reach their full potential and passionately take on the world, people are choosing our brands for what they stand for. That is brand power. 
It's also essential that our strong brand creative is as effective as possible and showing up in the right places, and that's where the science comes in. We've updated our media mix. We've balanced investments between conversion with existing customers and top of the funnel to build awareness, brand love and reach new audiences. And when coupled with rigorous marketing effectiveness and a fully maximized third-party data set, we're seeing this pay off. Brand health is improving. We're growing our customer file and our brands are delivering results. 
Let me start with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered record sales with 18% comparable sales growth versus 2019. Strong storytelling, trend-right product and strategic discounting are bringing a new and more valuable customer in driving higher spend and margin dollars. Moving forward, the team is leveraging data science to allocate inventory to specific stores with great precision, further improving profitability. Old Navy will scale this capability in the back half, and we look forward to deploying it across the rest of our brands in 2022. 
And just last week, Old Navy brought the democracy of style and service together with their women's inclusive style sizing launch, BODEQUALITY. We now offer women's styles in every size with no price difference fully integrated in both stores and online. No other top 20 mass retailer does that. This is the largest integrated launch in the brand's history and an important growth driver for the business for years to come. The average woman in the U.S. wears a size 16 to 18, so with very few competitors in the plus space, Old Navy is positioned to take a significant share of the $120 billion women's market. 
Moving to Gap. Gap is restoring relevance as an iconic American brand, and the North American business has reached a major inflection point with 12% comparable sales growth versus 2019. This is a testament to the hard work the team has done to fix the core business, focusing on execution at every turn. The assortment is better and tighter, product quality is better, discounts are lower, and when customers shop at Gap, they're met with a faster redesigned site and refreshed stores that are lighter and brighter, bringing the optimism our customers expect. This means Gap Brand is poised and ready to welcome new customers as we leverage the strength of partners to amplify our reach. Early results on Gap Home are encouraging and YEEZY Gap has created a new iconic item around jacket with 75% of customers who preordered being new to Gap. 
I mentioned earlier that our classic Gap hoodie is having a moment, so much so that we reissued it in a vintage brown for preorder delivering this fall. And it's not just on TikTok. We've seen elevated search levels across Google, 7x more people search for the hoodie on gap.com in Q2 than a year ago. Data shows we are attracting a younger fan base with our team logo hoodie outpacing adult sizes by 4x. I share this offer even, this is a brand that is resonating. This is a brand that people care about and want to wear proudly across their chests. 
Next, Banana Republic. I'm pleased with the creative progress and momentum we saw at Banana Republic quarter-over-quarter. The dress business rebound along with pants, short and woven tops as consumers shift back to vacation, occasion and workwear. Better execution online and a more relevant product assortment allowed the brand to pull back on discounting without resistance and attract new and younger customers. There's a lot of energy heading into the brand's fall relaunch and its vision of bringing affordable luxury to the market. Beautifully designed products like silk and kashmir and leather and enhanced site design, premium service and curated store experiences appealing to all senses will build over the next several months. 
And finally, Athleta, which delivered 27% growth versus 2019. As the country reopened, Athleta saw its performance lifestyle assortment accelerate as customers found versatility in styles that performs for travel, work and working out. As a perfect amplifier of the brand's value, a site sponsorship of world-class athletes in Tokyo boosted brand awareness to 33% versus 26% last year according to YouGov. And next week, we will launch Athleta Online in Canada, which was made possible quickly due to our DC network and our existing infrastructure there. 
Athleta is a consumer curiosity that fuels every detail of its brand expression. Last month, it launched at Athleta Well, an immersive digital platform rooted in well-being designed to build loyalty engagement and a community of empowered business. Members can engage in dynamic conversations with bedded efforts on topics like outfitting, fitness, mental health and body positivity. They can also participate in one-of-a-kind experiences from interactive workshops to guided meditation and enjoy premium content from partners like Obe Fitness. This is an integral part of Athleta's evolution from a performance brand to a true lifestyle brand, and a key component of our strategy to develop enduring relationships with new and existing customers. 
Next, the power of our platform. We're embracing a try fast, learn fast, think big mentality to push for convenience and engaging customer experiences across the entire customer journey. With the debut of YEEZY Gap, we also launched an innovative out-of-the-box online experience, complete with preorder functionality and a digital waiting room. Our Instagram shopping pilot with [indiscernible] was a successful test of distributed e-commerce, while our work on site speed and inventory availability are yielding Net Promoter Score improvement. Launches like Athleta are made possible with the power of our platform. We've created the digital community faster and more efficiently because of our scale and our tech might, and we're able to leverage this technology across all brands as we explore new ways to connect with them all. 
This quarter, we maintained our digital dominance with online delivering sales growth of 65% on a 2-year basis. Because of this growth, we're making investments across our distribution network to accommodate additional capacity and a new 2- to 3-day shipping promise for top-tier loyalty members. And meanwhile, our sourcing optimization efforts are ramping up as we look to reduce cost per package and simultaneously increased units per package. 
And finally, the power of our portfolio. In July, we unveiled our new integrated loyalty program, featuring a new value proposition, anchored by faster shipping promise, a new tier structure, on-demand points redemption and the ability to do good through points donation. We know we build loyalty with our more than 65 million active customers by connecting deeply with them. This program allows us to engage personally with noncredit card customers through experiences, not just discounting to build lifetime value by migrating them up the value chain. 
As we add customers to our file and transition them from one and done to cross-brands and multichannel shoppers, we see a significant increase in revenue and value. Our growing card and loyalty program already has 40 million members, it has exceeded our expectations. We're proud to have issued our nondual equity in [indiscernible] in June, summarizing development, actions and progress towards our 2025 commitments, a critical step as we work towards our goal of creating for all, with all. 
Looking ahead, we're prepared for back-to-school. Our kids and baby business has been a point of strength in both Old Navy and Gap. In between the 2 brands, we represent 9% of the market. That said, we are clear-eyed about the fluid ecosystem we operate within, [indiscernible] some inflation to waste pressure or the recent surge of the Delta variant. The teams are mitigating supply headwinds from closures in the countries where we source and make our clothes and delays due to port congestion and transportation challenges. 
Thanks to the speed and scale of our omnichannel business, deep supplier relationships and the playbook we built at the start of the pandemic, we are advantaged here. We are stronger, we're healthier, we're faster and we're more focused Gap Inc. than we were a year ago, and that gives me great confidence that our portfolio can navigate in the headwinds to come. 
Our results will be acceleration of our Power Plan 2023. And as we shed unproductive sales and increase the speed of ideation and implementation, we are doubling down on 3 areas to drive sustainable long-term growth. First, we're looking at strategic expansion of the addressable market. As we study important trends in the market, like wellness and the home body economy, we see a sizable future opportunity to compete in new categories. This shows up in product extensions like inclusive sizing as mentioned earlier, as well as home, intimates and fleet, which comprise a combined $326 billion in addressable markets. And when you couple that with our partner to amplify strategy, whether they're celebrity partnerships like YEEZY Gap or franchise and licensing partnerships like Gap Home that expand our reach, that's a multiplier for growth. 
Next, as our momentum builds, we have an acute focus on customer lifetime value fueled by our marketing investment. Our work in loyalty, personalization and creating signature experiences across channels will help attract new customers while developing connections and the stickiness with our current room. The literal community and partnership with Fitness platform Obe and our upcoming work on fit transformation are ways to deepen the relationship with the customer and to encourage upselling and cross-selling and increase that lifetime value. 
And finally, digital transformation. We are investing more in technology this year than we ever have. Since moving to the cloud last October, every dollar we spend goes further towards growth and innovation versus modernization, innovation that could impact our entire portfolio of brands. And that speed of our technology deployment has increased our confidence to invest further. We are digitizing operations and increasing formation across inventory management, stores in key areas of the value chain to unlock cost and margins. We're prioritizing work that will have long-term impact end-to-end. We believe it will radically define our operating cost structure and create an operating machine to support our long-term ambition for growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Katrina, I want to take a moment to celebrate Gap Inc.'s co-founder, Doris Fisher, who celebrated her 90th birthday this week. As our company's first working mom and arbiter accrual, she inspired generations of women to champion one another to follow their instincts with passion and heart. She and Don Fisher set the bar high with an eye towards what the consumer is craving and have instilled an owner culture that is crucially preserved. So tomorrow and on her birthday, our team is dedicating our time to local communities in our first ever Doris Fisher Day of because as she has said, we can always do more. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Katrina."

Building on the momentum from Q1, we delivered very strong second quarter results. With the backdrop of a strong consumer demand for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands remained high. As Sonia dis",2487,"Thanks, Sonia, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on the momentum from Q1, we delivered very strong second quarter results. With the backdrop of a strong consumer demand for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands remained high. As Sonia discussed, we believe this is the work of our team's tremendous progress on executing our Power Plan 2023 strategy. 
Of note are the following: one, our strategy is driving growth consistently. First, Old Navy and Athleta grew 21% and 35%, respectively, in Q2 versus 2019, and combined, represented 65% of company sales. Both brands delivered standout sales performance, led by their brand strength, omnichannel offerings and relevant product categories. Gap North America is growing with a 12% 2-year comp in the second quarter, demonstrating continued strength in our core North American market. This growth underscores the progress the brand is making in products and operations. We're pleased to have new leadership at Banana Republic, infusing creativity and improving customer experience, resulting in improved sales and operating performance in Q2 as the brand regains relevance. 
We're becoming digitally dominant. Our online business grew 65% in Q2 versus 2019. At over $6 billion in sales, our online channel is ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales. And when combined with our well-located fleet is a strategic advantage in serving our customers through the omnichannel lens. And we're targeting continued growth for all our brands, adding categories and reaching new addressable markets through extensions like home, plus size and community and wellness as we strive for sustainable momentum. 
Two, we're making the hard decisions to improve the company's economic model and drive management's focus on what matters. Our fleet rationalization is on track in driving significant economic value. Last year, we announced a plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America and expect that 75% will be completed by the end of this year. These closures, along with lease negotiations and higher online sales contributed to over 330 basis points of ROD leverage in Q2 versus 2019, and will contribute ongoing value for the remainder of the year. 
The transition of our European market to a new and more profitable operating model is underway and expected to be completed this year. We're making great progress on our goal of improving the performance and profitability of Gap Brands as we partner to amplify through asset-light models. And we successfully divested 2 smaller brands as we focus on our $4 billion purpose-driven lifestyle brands. 
And three, we're leveraging the power of our shared platform to enable our growth agenda and help us navigate the near-term volatility in the market. Some relevant examples are as follows: our technology spend, enabled by our recent cloud migration, has been meaningfully deployed against new digital capabilities, improving site performance and enhancing customer experience across all of our brands; our new tiered loyalty program rollout, combined with our already strong cross-brand credit card program enables our 65 million known active customers to shop with rewards across our portfolio, maximizing customer lifetime value; our scaled and automated DC network supports our online growth and our improved loyalty shipping promise increases efficiency and drives down fulfillment costs. Strategic partnerships within our vendor base are allowing for rapid product innovation across the company such as the launch of Old Navy's power soft active fabric sourced from fabric technology used in Athleta Powervita collection, which has enabled Old Navy to dominate the value active space and has propelled the company's total active growth with sales on target for $4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2021. And our strength and size in Canada will enable Athleta to enter the Gap market in Q3 seamlessly. There are more, but these are just a few examples of how the power of the platform is a competitive advantage to growing all of our brands as we drive the synergy of the portfolio with the scale of the platform. 
Given our year-to-date performance and confidence in our strategy, we are raising our outlook for the year despite continuing macro headwinds. We now expect fiscal year 2021 sales to grow about 30% versus fiscal year 2020 and with an operating margin of about 7% on a reported basis and about 7.5% on an adjusted basis. This upwardly revised outlook puts us on an accelerated path towards our 2023 operating margin target of 10% plus. And we expect our fiscal year 2021 reported EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05, with adjusted EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, a $0.50 increase from last quarter. 
COVID variants continue to cause volatility in certain markets, and we're actively working through supply chain constraints, inflation and wage pressure. We expect these challenges will continue for the remainder of the year but our teams have been hard at work, leveraging our scale advantages and strong relationships with vendors and carriers to navigate materials and other cost increases and secure necessary ocean and air capacity to navigate supply chain delays. 
Now turning to second quarter financials. Net sales for the quarter were up 5% versus 2019, and comp sales increased 12% on a 2-year basis. Permanent store closures and the divestitures of our Intermix and Janie & Jack businesses impacted sales by approximately 8 points. 
In our international markets, COVID-related store closures persisted for most of the quarter, resulting in an estimated 2 percentage point impact to sales versus 2019. We're pleased to report that while we're still carefully monitoring the COVID situation globally, as of the end of Q2, nearly all of our stores have reopened. Even as store sales start to rebound, outsized online growth continues. Enabled by investments in our omnichannel capabilities, customers are getting a great experience engaging with our brands regardless of how they choose to shop with us. The online business grew 65% versus 2019 and contributed 33% of total sales in the quarter. 
As noted in our press release, second quarter reported results include an SG&A charge of $19 million, primarily related to the decision to close our stores business in the U.K. and Ireland, which will ultimately drive improved profitability and remove fixed costs from our structure. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings press release. 
In terms of gross margin, second quarter gross margin was 43.3%, reaching a historical high in the quarter and expanding 440 basis points versus 2019. The majority of the expansion resulted from ROD leverage from online growth, strategic North American store closures and the ongoing benefit of renegotiated rents for the remaining fleet. 
During the quarter, ROD leveraged by 330 basis points versus 2019, a trend that we expect to directionally carry forward in the second half of 2021. In addition, we were able to reduce discounting across all of our brands, resulting in meaningful average unit retail growth versus 2019 and significantly expanded product margins. Despite 130 basis points in higher shipping costs, primarily due to increased online demand, merchandise margins still improved versus 2019 by 110 basis points. 
Turning to SG&A. On a reported basis, SG&A of 33.6% deleveraged by 180 basis points compared to fiscal 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 33.1% of sales, 260 basis points higher than 2019 adjusted SG&A. We are acutely focused on driving down fixed expense to reinvest in demand generation as we look to grow sales in the long term. 
In Q2, our work on optimizing store expenses yielded about 150 basis points of benefit, helping to fund high-impact marketing, fueling brand health and relevance. Marketing drove 230 basis points of the increase to 2019 as we leaned into further digital marketing, celebrity partnerships and important growth initiatives like our integrated loyalty program launch. The success we're seeing, evidenced by improved profit margins and new customer acquisition, gives us confidence to lean into this important demand-driving strategy in the second half as we expect marketing spend of approximately 6% of sales for the full year. In addition, we experienced approximately 200 basis points in higher bonus accrual costs related to our strong financial outlook and pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Regarding operating margin, operating margin for the quarter was 9.7% on a reported basis adjusted operating margin of 10.2% increased 190 basis points versus 2019 adjusted operating margin. As the initiatives of our strategy take hold, we're encouraged to see those results through growing sales with improved profitability. 
Moving on to taxes and interest. The effective tax rate was 28% for second quarter of fiscal 2021. Second quarter net interest expense was $50 million. Regarding earnings on the quarter, reported earnings per share for Q2 were $0.67, up $0.23 compared to 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.70, an increase of $0.07 to 2019 adjusted EPS. 
Turning to inventory. Second quarter inventory ended up 2% compared to 2020 and down 2% to 2019. As part of our strategy to mitigate challenges within the supply chain due to capacity and COVID impact, we are leveraging our scale advantages to ensure we have appropriate inventory to fuel sales growth during the important holiday season. We currently expect third quarter ending inventory to be up mid-single digits compared to last year. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we paid the second quarter dividend of $0.12 per share and completed approximately $55 million in share repurchases as part of our plan to repurchase up to $200 million in shares this year to offset dilution. Earlier this month, we announced we will pay a third quarter dividend of $0.12, consistent with our plan to return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend program. We ended the quarter with 376 million shares outstanding. 
Finally, before we turn to our 2021 outlook, a brief update on the progress of our North America real estate plan and the transition of our European operating model. Year-to-date, we've closed 24 Gap and Banana Republic stores as part of our 350-store closure plan for North America. As a reminder, we expect we will be about 75% complete on that plan by the end of 2021 with 189 North America stores closed in 2020 and 75 stores expected to close this year. Old Navy and Athleta opened 25 and 13 stores, respectively, year-to-date on a path toward 30 to 40 openings at Old Navy and 20 to 30 openings at Athleta. 
Regarding the partner to amplify strategy we're deploying in our European market, we've announced that we are in discussions to move to a partnership model in France and Italy, and that while we will still maintain an online presence, we will be closing our store locations in the U.K. and Ireland. Year-to-date, we've closed 26 stores with the remaining 58 stores expected to close by the end of September. In the short term, we're not projecting a benefit in the back half of 2021 due to employee and lease-related costs as we wind down the stores business, but these strategic changes are expected to drive earnings accretion on an annual basis. For some helpful context, in fiscal 2019, the European market generated $539 million in net sales. About half of these sales were generated by the U.K. and Ireland stores at a slight operating loss. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our full year financial outlook. We're providing both the reported and adjusted outlook for the year. Earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 on a reported basis, which includes nonrecurring charges related to divestitures and the impact of changes to our European operating model totaling approximately $0.20. Excluding these charges, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, a $0.50 increase to our prior guidance. We now expect sales growth of about 30% versus 2020. This incorporates the loss of sales due to store closures in the U.K. and Ireland. 
Reported operating margin is expected to be about 7%. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be about 7.5%, an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance and puts us well on the path to the 10%-plus goal laid out in our Power Plan 2023. 
As we develop this outlook, we considered a number of scenarios, carefully balancing the benefits related to our brand strength, new product offerings and loyalty program against the near-term expense from inflation and supply chain pressures, including sizable investments in air freight to partially mitigate longer lead times and shipping delays so that our inventories will be well positioned to compete during back-to-school and holiday. 
Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to expect to spend approximately $800 million for the full year. Our strong cash generation is enabling investments in our sustainable growth strategy. With a sharp focus on ROIC, we're targeting high return investments in digital, loyalty and supply chain capacity in addition to store growth at Old Navy and Athleta. 
As I look forward, I'm energized by the following: first is that our strategic approach to growth is working. As Sonia articulated, we're driving growth in existing categories and we're targeting new addressable share rooted in customer trends with initiatives like BODEQUALITY at Old Navy and Athleta Canada low launching in Q3. And our study at the home body economy and wellness trends may open the door to other new and exciting growth categories and services in 2022 and beyond. 
Next is our acute focus on customer lifetime value. With the formal launch of our integrated loyalty program in July, we're significantly increasing our ability to attract -- interact with customers in a more personalized and meaningful way. The program has already grown to over 40 million members. And based on the early results from the program's soft launch last fall, we expect to see increased purchase frequency and higher average order size from loyalty members. 
In addition to driving better transaction economics within a brand, the program encourages consumers to become multi-brand loyalists through our universal rewards program. Loyalty is just one way that we've doubled down on building deep relationships with our customers that result in stickiness and deliver value. 
Finally, our commitment to transforming the fixed costs in the business into demand-generating dollars for investment or EBIT expansion is showing results. Our fleet rationalization is deeply underway. Our smaller brands have been divested and our partner to amplify strategy for international operations is in flight. We've also begun to pivot our technology investment towards the digitization of the enterprise. From our inventory management transformation and shipping optimization work, to productivity improvements in stores using technology and proven automation practices from our DCs, we are now developing a road map for leveraging the use of data and AI to unlock trapped costs, increase speed and aid in decision-making, proactively unlocking investment dollars to drive long-term growth. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

In one of the biggest launches in the brand's history, those 2 drivers of growth is something that we're confident in.

The first order bit was getting the art right, the brand positioning, the product, the marketing, the store experience, right, the fundamentals and the online experience, and we're making momentum there. But I would say that as we invest more in marketing as we invest more in the technology to drive yield, such as examples like inventory management or order logic or minimizing returns via the acquisition we announced today, these are all multiple drivers of growth. And then layer on top of that, our new loyalty program, which we all know is a proven mechanism to drive price and customer value.

All of that gives us great confidence in the AUR expansion in the back half. 
I'm not going to comment on AUC other than to say our outlook already contemplates any potential increases in AUC that would come from the incremental airfreight that we've put in. And as Sonia mentioned, and I mentioned, we are spending money on air freight to compete in the back half so that we have the right inventory here to be able to continue our market share grab in the back half of the year.

And so we feel quite confident that our strategically advantaged supply chain is giving us the opportunity to compete well, combined with then the AUR and price elasticity that we have in the back half."

So if there's a country like Vietnam that we've all read about having some COVID concerns, we're able to work with these partners across multiple countries of their manufacturing to shift as needed. 
Next, we have advantaged transportation relationship. We booked advantage -- cost advantaged air capacity 6 months ago. So we're not paying spot rates. We're being strategic here. We have vessel capacity that is fast and giving us speed advantage. So you couple all of these nodes in the supply chain together and you then apply that against our 1 billion units a year. And this is where scale matters. So we will be first out of the gate with from our vendors and also we will pay the least amount for the advantage speed that we are investing in. So we feel good about navigating what is a very volatile environment certainly and changes all the time. But we have real-time -- near real-time visibility to what's coming and it's all baked into our forecast."

And then Athleta continues its momentum and also is entering with online in Canada in the back half as well as having the Simon Biles relationship really begin to take traction with the girl customer there. So that's how to think about those 2 brands. 
And then at Banana Republic, we really do expect that with the fall season, we will begin to see their new marketing and execution on their website in stores with products start to take hold, fall into holiday. And at Gap, I think you're seeing that the Core Gap is very strong in the North American market. I think we gave you some color on how to think about the U.K. and Ireland stores and the revenue that we'll see loss there, but then also the better profit impact going forward in 2022, what that will be, so -- and lots of pieces to the puzzle, but that's how to think about the revenue by brand. 
As far as the air costs, we haven't quantified that, but it is significant. And we are obviously, as Sonia said, we've actually taken a bunch of capacity in the market about 6 months ago. So we're actually evaluating daily, weekly, hourly, what of that capacity to use and when.

Katrina and I are glad to be here today to share our second quarter results. 
First, I'll share my thoughts on the quarter and how elements of our Power Plan 2023 came to life across our brands, platform and portfolio. I'll also share how we're positioned to grow well into the future through digital transformation, strategic expansion of addressable markets and an acute focus on building customer lifetime value. Then I'll turn it over to Katrina to give a more detailed view of our financials and outlook for the rest of the year. 
We're happy with the strong top and bottom line results we delivered this quarter. We grew comparable sales by 12% versus 2019 and delivered the highest Q2 sales in over a decade, even after walking away from 8% of unproductive sales from the divestiture of the 2 smaller brands and the strategic store closures at our North American market. To the entire team, thank you for your commitment to our customers and our company every day. 
Our customers' in great summer with optimism, hungry for mood-boosting clothes as vacations and reunions became reality. We saw a celebration of American style, of '90s nostalgia and the resurgence of denim. All of these sits in a sweet spot across our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands. Staying close with our customer and keenly observing their cues allowed us to react quickly to the shift in trends. While there's still a favorable consumer environment, we were pleased to maintain our momentum and believe this is a strong indication that our strategy is working. 
Starting with the power of our brand. Over the last several quarters, we've mentioned an increasing investment in marketing and brand amplifying partnership. Our investments, at about 6% of sales for the year, is roughly 50% higher than historic levels, all deployed against fueling demand for each of our brands. We've dialed up marketing efforts by balancing art and science to grow market share, to acquire new customers and drive profitable growth. 
First is art. Fueled by new creative confidence, our brands are using their unique voices, optimism, values and cultural relevance to connect with customers rather than relying on discounts to drive the quick simple steps. Whether it's Old Navy and Grammy-nominated recording artist, H.E.R., celebrating the reopening of America or Gap turning to TikTok fans to choose the next color for its iconic logo hoodie after a viral comeback of the classics or Banana Republic tapping into '80s nostalgia and our shared desire to get back out into the world with their recent vintage and travel-inspired capital collections or Athleta and Simone Biles partnering to help girls reach their full potential and passionately take on the world, people are choosing our brands for what they stand for. That is brand power. 
It's also essential that our strong brand creative is as effective as possible and showing up in the right places, and that's where the science comes in. We've updated our media mix. We've balanced investments between conversion with existing customers and top of the funnel to build awareness, brand love and reach new audiences. And when coupled with rigorous marketing effectiveness and a fully maximized third-party data set, we're seeing this pay off. Brand health is improving. We're growing our customer file and our brands are delivering results. 
Let me start with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered record sales with 18% comparable sales growth versus 2019. Strong storytelling, trend-right product and strategic discounting are bringing a new and more valuable customer in driving higher spend and margin dollars. Moving forward, the team is leveraging data science to allocate inventory to specific stores with great precision, further improving profitability. Old Navy will scale this capability in the back half, and we look forward to deploying it across the rest of our brands in 2022. 
And just last week, Old Navy brought the democracy of style and service together with their women's inclusive style sizing launch, BODEQUALITY. We now offer women's styles in every size with no price difference fully integrated in both stores and online. No other top 20 mass retailer does that. This is the largest integrated launch in the brand's history and an important growth driver for the business for years to come. The average woman in the U.S. wears a size 16 to 18, so with very few competitors in the plus space, Old Navy is positioned to take a significant share of the $120 billion women's market. 
Moving to Gap. Gap is restoring relevance as an iconic American brand, and the North American business has reached a major inflection point with 12% comparable sales growth versus 2019. This is a testament to the hard work the team has done to fix the core business, focusing on execution at every turn. The assortment is better and tighter, product quality is better, discounts are lower, and when customers shop at Gap, they're met with a faster redesigned site and refreshed stores that are lighter and brighter, bringing the optimism our customers expect. This means Gap Brand is poised and ready to welcome new customers as we leverage the strength of partners to amplify our reach. Early results on Gap Home are encouraging, and YEEZY Gap has created a new iconic item around jacket with 75% of customers who preordered being new to Gap. 
I mentioned earlier that our classic Gap hoodie is having a moment, so much so that we reissued it in a vintage brown for preorder delivering this fall. And it's not just on TikTok. We've seen elevated search levels across Google, 7x more people search for the hoodie on gap.com in Q2 than a year ago. Data shows we are attracting a younger fan base with our teen logo hoodie outpacing adult sizes by 4x. I share this offer even, this is a brand that is resonating. This is a brand that people care about and want to wear proudly across their chests. 
Next, Banana Republic. I'm pleased with the creative progress and momentum we saw at Banana Republic quarter-over-quarter. The dress business rebound along with pants, short and woven tops as consumers shift back to vacation, occasion and workwear. Better execution online and a more relevant product assortment allowed the brand to pull back on discounting without resistance and attract new and younger customers. There's a lot of energy heading into the brand's fall relaunch and its vision of bringing affordable luxury to the market. Beautifully designed products like silk and kashmir and leather and enhanced site design, premium service and curated store experiences appealing to all senses will build over the next several months. 
And finally, Athleta, which delivered 27% growth versus 2019. As the country reopened, Athleta saw its performance lifestyle assortment accelerate as customers found versatility in styles that performs for travel, work and working out. As a perfect amplifier of the brand's value, Athleta's sponsorship of world-class athletes in Tokyo boosted brand awareness to 33% versus 26% last year according to YouGov. And next week, we will launch Athleta Online in Canada, which was made possible quickly due to our DC network and our existing infrastructure there. 
Athleta is a consumer curiosity that fuels every detail of its brand expression. Last month, it launched at Athleta Well, an immersive digital platform rooted in well-being designed to build loyalty engagement and a community of empowered business. Members can engage in dynamic conversations with vetted experts on topics like outfitting, fitness, mental health and body positivity. They can also participate in one-of-a-kind experiences from interactive workshops to guided meditation and enjoy premium content from partners like Obe Fitness. This is an integral part of Athleta's evolution from a performance brand to a true lifestyle brand, and a key component of our strategy to develop enduring relationships with new and existing customers. 
Next, the power of our platform. We're embracing a try fast, learn fast, think big mentality to push for convenience and engaging customer experiences across the entire customer journey. With the debut of YEEZY Gap, we also launched an innovative out-of-the-box online experience, complete with preorder functionality and a digital waiting room. Our Instagram shopping pilot with Athleta and Old Navy was a successful test of distributed e-commerce, while our work on site speed and inventory availability are yielding Net Promoter Score improvement. Launches like Athleta are made possible with the power of our platform. We've created the digital community faster and more efficiently because of our scale and our tech might, and we're able to leverage this technology across all brands as we explore new ways to connect with them all. 
This quarter, we maintained our digital dominance with online delivering sales growth of 65% on a 2-year basis. Because of this growth, we're making investments across our distribution network to accommodate additional capacity and a new 2- to 3-day shipping promise for top-tier loyalty members. And meanwhile, our sourcing optimization efforts are ramping up as we look to reduce cost per package and simultaneously increase units per package. 
And finally, the power of our portfolio. In July, we unveiled our new integrated loyalty program, featuring a new value proposition anchored by faster shipping promise, a new tier structure, on-demand points redemption and the ability to do good through points donation. We know we build loyalty with our more than 65 million active customers by connecting deeply with them. This program allows us to engage personally with noncredit card customers through experiences, not just discounting to build lifetime value by migrating them up the value chain. 
As we add customers to our file and transition them from one and done to cross-brands and multichannel shoppers, we see a significant increase in revenue and value. Our growing card and loyalty program already has 40 million members. It has exceeded our expectations. We're proud to have issued our inaugural Equality & Belonging report in June, summarizing development, actions and progress towards our 2025 commitments, a critical step as we work towards our goal of creating for all, with all. 
Looking ahead, we're prepared for back-to-school. Our kids and baby business has been a point of strength in both Old Navy and Gap. In between the 2 brands, we represent 9% of the market. That said, we are clear-eyed about the fluid ecosystem we operate within, from inflation to waste pressure or the recent surge of the Delta variant. The teams are mitigating supply chain headwinds from closures in the countries where we source and make our clothes and delays due to port congestion and transportation challenges. 
Thanks to the speed and scale of our omnichannel business, deep supplier relationships and the playbook we built at the start of the pandemic, we are advantaged here. We are stronger, we're healthier, we're faster and we're more a focused Gap Inc. than we were a year ago, and that gives me great confidence that our portfolio can navigate in headwinds to come. 
Our results will be acceleration of our Power Plan 2023. And as we shed unproductive sales and increase the speed of ideation and implementation, we are doubling down on 3 areas to drive sustainable long-term growth. First, we're looking at strategic expansion of the addressable market. As we study important trends in the market, like wellness and the home body economy, we see a sizable future opportunity to compete in new categories. This shows up in product extensions like inclusive sizing, as I mentioned earlier as well as home, intimates and fleet, which comprise a combined $326 billion in addressable markets. And when you couple that with our partner to amplify strategy, whether they're celebrity partnerships like YEEZY Gap or franchise, and licensing partnerships like Gap Home that expand our reach, that's a multiplier for growth. 
Next, as our momentum builds, we have an acute focus on customer lifetime value fueled by our marketing investment. Our work in loyalty, personalization and creating signature experiences across channels will help attract new customers while developing connections and stickiness with our current one. The AthletaWell community and partnership with Fitness platform Obe and our upcoming work on fit transformation are ways to deepen the relationship with the customer and to encourage upselling and cross-selling and increase that lifetime value. 
And finally, digital transformation. We are investing more in technology this year than we ever have. Since moving to the cloud last October, every dollar we spend goes further towards growth and innovation versus modernization, innovation that could impact our entire portfolio of brands. And that speed of our technology deployment has increased our confidence to invest further. We are digitizing operations and increasing automation across inventory management, stores and key areas of the value chain to unlock cost and margins, a prioritizing work that will have long-term impact end-to-end. We believe it will radically redefine our operating cost structure and create an operating machine to support our long-term ambition for growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Katrina, I want to take a moment to celebrate Gap Inc.'s co-Founder, Doris Fisher, who celebrated her 90th birthday this week. As our company's first working mom and the arbiter of cool, she inspired generations of women to champion one another to follow their instincts with passion and heart. She and Don Fisher set the bar high with an eye towards what the consumer was craving and have instilled an owner culture that is crucially preserved. So tomorrow, in honor of her birthday, our team is dedicating our time to local communities in our first-ever Doris Fisher Day observance because, as she has said, ""We can always do more."" 
With that, I'll pass it over to Katrina."

As Sonia d",2484,"Thanks, Sonia, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Building on the momentum from Q1, we delivered very strong second quarter results, with the backdrop of a strong consumer demand for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands remained high. As Sonia discussed, we believe this is the work of our team's tremendous progress on executing our Power Plan 2023 strategy. 
Of note are the following: one, our strategy is driving growth consistently. First, Old Navy and Athleta grew 21% and 35%, respectively, in Q2 versus 2019, and combined, represented 65% of company sales. Both brands delivered standout sales performance, led by their brand strength, omnichannel offerings and relevant product categories. Gap North America is growing with a 12% 2-year comp in the second quarter, demonstrating continued strength in our core North America market. This growth underscores the progress the brand is making in products and operations. We're pleased to have new leadership at Banana Republic, infusing creativity and improving customer experience, resulting in improved sales and operating performance in Q2 as the brand regains relevance. 
We're becoming digitally dominant. Our online business grew 65% in Q2 versus 2019. At over $6 billion in sales, our online channel is ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales, and when combined with our well-located fleet, is a strategic advantage in serving our customers through the omnichannel lens. And we're targeting continued growth for all our brands, adding categories and reaching new addressable markets through extensions like home, plus size and community and wellness as we strive for sustainable momentum. 
Two, we're making the hard decisions to improve the company's economic model and drive management's focus on what matters. Our fleet rationalization is on track in driving significant economic value. Last year, we announced a plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America and expect that 75% will be completed by the end of this year. These closures, along with lease negotiations and higher online sales contributed to over 330 basis points of ROD leverage in Q2 versus 2019, and will contribute ongoing value for the remainder of the year. 
The transition of our European market to a new and more profitable operating model is underway and expected to be completed this year. We're making great progress on our goal of improving the performance and profitability of Gap Brands as we partner to amplify through asset-light models. And we successfully divested 2 smaller brands as we focus on our $4 billion purpose-driven lifestyle brands. 
And three, we're leveraging the power of our shared platform to enable our growth agenda and help us navigate the near-term volatility in the market. Some relevant examples are as follows. Our technology spend, enabled by our recent cloud migration, has been meaningfully deployed against new digital capabilities, improving site performance and enhancing customer experience across all of our brands. Our new tiered loyalty program rollout, combined with our already strong cross-brand credit card program enables our 65 million known active customers to shop with rewards across our portfolio, maximizing customer lifetime value. Our scaled and automated DC network supports our online growth, and our improved loyalty shipping promise increases efficiency and drives down fulfillment costs. 
Strategic partnerships within our vendor base are allowing for rapid product innovation across the company such as the launch of Old Navy's PowerSoft active fabric sourced from fabric technology used in Athleta's Powervita collection, which has enabled Old Navy to dominate the value active space and has propelled the company's total active growth, with sales on target for $4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2021. And our strength and size in Canada will enable Athleta to enter that market in Q3 seamlessly. There are more, but these are just a few examples of how the power of the platform is a competitive advantage to growing all of our brands as we drive the synergy of the portfolio with the scale of the platform. 
Given our year-to-date performance and confidence in our strategy, we are raising our outlook for the year despite continuing macro headwinds. We now expect fiscal year 2021 sales to grow about 30% versus fiscal year 2020 and with an operating margin of about 7% on a reported basis and about 7.5% on an adjusted basis. This upwardly revised outlook puts us on an accelerated path towards our 2023 operating margin target of 10% plus. And we expect our fiscal year 2021 reported EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05, with adjusted EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, a $0.50 increase from last quarter. 
COVID variants continue to cause volatility in certain markets, and we're actively working through supply chain constraints, inflation and wage pressure. We expect these challenges will continue for the remainder of the year but our teams have been hard at work, leveraging our scale advantages and strong relationships with vendors and carriers to navigate materials and other cost increases and secure necessary ocean and air capacity to navigate supply chain delays. 
Now turning to second quarter financials. Net sales for the quarter were up 5% versus 2019, and comp sales increased 12% on a 2-year basis. Permanent store closures and the divestitures of our Intermix and Janie & Jack businesses impacted sales by approximately 8 points. 
In our international markets, COVID-related store closures persisted for most of the quarter, resulting in an estimated 2 percentage point impact to sales versus 2019. We're pleased to report that while we're still carefully monitoring the COVID situation globally, as of the end of Q2, nearly all of our stores have reopened. Even as store sales start to rebound, outsized online growth continues. Enabled by investments in our omnichannel capabilities, customers are getting a great experience engaging with our brands regardless of how they choose to shop with us. The online business grew 65% versus 2019 and contributed 33% of total sales in the quarter. 
As noted in our press release, second quarter reported results include an SG&A charge of $19 million, primarily related to the decision to close our stores business in the U.K. and Ireland, which will ultimately drive improved profitability and remove fixed costs from our structure. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings press release. 
In terms of gross margin, second quarter gross margin was 43.3%, reaching an historical high in the quarter and expanding 440 basis points versus 2019. The majority of the expansion resulted from ROD leverage from online growth, strategic North American store closures and the ongoing benefit of renegotiated rents for the remaining fleet. 
During the quarter, ROD leveraged by 330 basis points versus 2019, a trend that we expect to directionally carry forward in the second half of 2021. In addition, we were able to reduce discounting across all of our brands, resulting in meaningful average unit retail growth versus 2019 and significantly expanded product margins. Despite 130 basis points in higher shipping costs, primarily due to increased online demand, merchandise margins still improved versus 2019 by 110 basis points. 
Turning to SG&A. On a reported basis, SG&A of 33.6% deleveraged by 180 basis points compared to fiscal 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 33.1% of sales, 260 basis points higher than 2019 adjusted SG&A. We are acutely focused on driving down fixed expense to reinvest in demand generation as we look to grow sales in the long term. 
In Q2, our work on optimizing store expenses yielded about 150 basis points of benefit, helping to fund high-impact marketing, fueling brand health and relevance. Marketing drove 230 basis points of the increase to 2019 as we leaned into further digital marketing, celebrity partnerships and important growth initiatives like our integrated loyalty program launch. The success we're seeing, evidenced by improved profit margins and new customer acquisition, gives us confidence to lean into this important demand-driving strategy in the second half as we expect marketing spend of approximately 6% of sales for the full year. In addition, we experienced approximately 200 basis points in higher bonus accrual costs related to our strong financial outlook and pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Regarding operating margin, operating margin for the quarter was 9.7% on a reported basis adjusted operating margin of 10.2% increased 190 basis points versus 2019 adjusted operating margin. As the initiatives of our strategy take hold, we're encouraged to see those results through growing sales with improved profitability. 
Moving on to taxes and interest. The effective tax rate was 28% for second quarter of fiscal 2021. Second quarter net interest expense was $50 million. Regarding earnings on the quarter, reported earnings per share for Q2 were $0.67, up $0.23 compared to 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.70, an increase of $0.07 to 2019 adjusted EPS. 
Turning to inventory. Second quarter inventory ended up 2% compared to 2020 and down 2% to 2019. As part of our strategy to mitigate challenges within the supply chain due to capacity and COVID impact, we are leveraging our scale advantages to ensure we have appropriate inventory to fuel sales growth during the important holiday season. We currently expect third quarter ending inventory to be up mid-single digits compared to last year. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we paid the second quarter dividend of $0.12 per share and completed approximately $55 million in share repurchases as part of our plan to repurchase up to $200 million in shares this year to offset dilution. Earlier this month, we announced we will pay a third quarter dividend of $0.12, consistent with our plan to return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend program. We ended the quarter with 376 million shares outstanding. 
Finally, before we turn to our 2021 outlook, a brief update on the progress of our North America real estate plan and the transition of our European operating model. Year-to-date, we've closed 24 Gap and Banana Republic stores as part of our 350-store closure plan for North America. As a reminder, we expect we will be about 75% complete on that plan by the end of 2021 with 189 North America stores closed in 2020 and 75 stores expected to close this year. Old Navy and Athleta opened 25 and 13 stores, respectively, year-to-date on a path toward 30 to 40 openings at Old Navy and 20 to 30 openings at Athleta. 
Regarding the partner to amplify strategy we're deploying in our European market, we've announced that we are in discussions to move to a partnership model in France and Italy, and that while we will still maintain an online presence, we will be closing our store locations in the U.K. and Ireland. Year-to-date, we've closed 26 stores with the remaining 58 stores expected to close by the end of September. In the short term, we're not projecting a benefit in the back half of 2021 due to employee and lease-related costs as we wind down the stores business, but these strategic changes are expected to drive earnings accretion on an annual basis. For some helpful context, in fiscal 2019, the European market generated $539 million in net sales. About half of these sales were generated by the U.K. and Ireland stores at a slight operating loss. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our full year financial outlook. We're providing both the reported and adjusted outlook for the year. Earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 on a reported basis, which includes nonrecurring charges related to divestitures and the impact of changes to our European operating model totaling approximately $0.20. Excluding these charges, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, a $0.50 increase to our prior guidance. We now expect sales growth of about 30% versus 2020. This incorporates the loss of sales due to store closures in the U.K. and Ireland. 
Reported operating margin is expected to be about 7%. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be about 7.5%, an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance and puts us well on the path to the 10%-plus goal laid out in our Power Plan 2023. 
As we developed this outlook, we considered a number of scenarios, carefully balancing the benefits related to our brand strength, new product offerings and loyalty program against the near-term expense from inflation and supply chain pressures, including sizable investments in air freight to partially mitigate longer lead times and shipping delays so that our inventories will be well positioned to compete during back-to-school and holiday. 
Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to expect to spend approximately $800 million for the full year. Our strong cash generation is enabling investments in our sustainable growth strategy. With a sharp focus on ROIC, we're targeting high return investments in digital, loyalty and supply chain capacity, in addition to store growth at Old Navy and Athleta. 
As I look forward, I'm energized by the following: first is that our strategic approach to growth is working. As Sonia articulated, we're driving growth in existing categories, and we're targeting new addressable share rooted in customer trends with initiatives like BODEQUALITY at Old Navy and Athleta Canada launching in Q3. And our study of the home body economy and wellness trends may open the door to other new and exciting growth categories and services in 2022 and beyond. 
Next is our acute focus on customer lifetime value. With the formal launch of our integrated loyalty program in July, we're significantly increasing our ability to attract -- interact with customers in a more personalized and meaningful way. The program has already grown to over 40 million members. And based on the early results from the program's soft launch last fall, we expect to see increased purchase frequency and higher average order size from loyalty members. 
In addition to driving better transaction economics within a brand, the program encourages consumers to become multi-brand loyalists through our universal rewards program. Loyalty is just one way that we've doubled down on building deep relationships with our customers that result in stickiness and deliver value. 
Finally, our commitment to transforming the fixed costs in the business into demand-generating dollars for investment or EBIT expansion is showing results. Our fleet rationalization is deeply underway. Our smaller brands have been divested and our partner to amplify strategy for international operations is in flight. We've also begun to pivot our technology investment towards the digitization of the enterprise. From our inventory management transformation and shipping optimization work, to productivity improvements in stores using technology and proven automation practices from our DCs, we are now developing a road map for leveraging the use of data and AI to unlock trapped costs, increase speed and aid in decision-making, proactively unlocking investment dollars to drive long-term growth. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And as we think about that, as we think about their BODEQUALITY launch, which just happened, offering the entire women's assortment from double 0 to size 30 in stores and online at the same price, and one of the biggest launches in the brand's history, those 2 drivers of growth is something that we're confident in. And coupled with the science that Old Navy is building into its operating model, right? The inventory management transformations they're driving, as an example, which is aligned for a greater position of matching of supply/demand in their stores and in their DCs. So 3 great drivers, and I think we feel quite confident in our outlook and the momentum of Old Navy."

When it comes to the company and the acceleration you're referring to in revenue in the back half, I think what's exciting to us and what you heard in some of our prepared remarks is that our strategy really is about continuing to take market share in the core categories in which we dominate, so whether that's denim or active or kids and baby, but then also continue to supplement those core categories with new addressable markets like the BODEQUALITY launch, which will drive incremental value in the back half at Old Navy or the Athleta Canada entry, which will drive incremental value for Athleta, then combined with new lifetime value levers like loyalty launch, and then all supplemented by an incremental marketing spend that continues to drive profitable sales for us. 
So it's really this layering effect of initiatives and capabilities against our great brand strength that's driving that level of growth in the back half."

The first order bit was getting the art right, the brand positioning, the product, the marketing, the store experience, right, the fundamentals and the online experience. And we're making momentum there. 
But I would say that as we invest more in marketing, as we invest more in the technology to drive yield such as examples like inventory management or order logic or minimizing returns via the acquisition we announced today, these are all multiple drivers of growth. And then layer on top of that, our new loyalty program, which we all know is a proven mechanism to drive price and customer value.

All of that gives us great confidence in the AUR expansion in the back half. 
I'm not going to comment on AUC, other than to say our outlook already contemplates any potential increases in AUC that would come from the incremental airfreight that we've put in. And as Sonia mentioned, and I mentioned, we are spending money on air freight to compete in the back half so that we have the right inventory here to be able to continue our market share grab in the back half of the year.

Next, we have advantaged transportation relationship. We booked advantage -- cost advantaged air capacity 6 months ago. So we're not paying spot rates. We're being strategic here. We have vessel capacity that is fast and giving us speed advantage. So you couple all of these nodes in the supply chain together and you then apply that against our 1 billion units a year.

So that's how to think about those 2 brands. 
And then at Banana Republic, we really do expect that with the fall season, we will begin to see their new marketing and execution on their website and in stores with products start to take hold, fall into holiday. And at Gap, I think you're seeing that the Core Gap is very strong in the North American market. I think we gave you some color on how to think about the U.K. and Ireland stores and the revenue that we'll see loss there, but then also the better profit impact going forward in 2022, what that will be.

Katrina and I are glad to be here today to share our second quarter results. 
First, I'll share my thoughts on the quarter and how elements of our Power Plan 2023 came to life across our brands, platform and portfolio. I'll also share how we're positioned to grow well into the future through digital transformation, strategic expansion of addressable markets and an acute focus on building customer lifetime value. Then I'll turn it over to Katrina to give a more detailed view of our financials and outlook for the rest of the year. 
We're happy with the strong top and bottom line results we delivered this quarter. We grew comparable sales by 12% versus 2019 and delivered the highest Q2 sales in over a decade, even after walking away from 8% of unproductive sales from the divestiture of the 2 smaller brands and the strategic store closures at our North American market. To the entire team, thank you for your commitment to our customers and our company every day. 
Our customers embrace summer with optimism, hungry for mood-boosting clothes as vacations and reunions became reality. We saw a celebration of American style, of '90s nostalgia and the resurgence of denim. All of these sits in a sweet spot across our purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands. Staying close with our customer and keenly observing their cues allowed us to react quickly to the shift in trends. While there's still a favorable consumer environment, we were pleased to maintain our momentum and believe this is a strong indication that our strategy is working. 
Starting with the power of our brand. Over the last several quarters, we've mentioned an increasing investment in marketing and brand amplifying partnership. Our investments, at about 6% of sales for the year, is roughly 50% higher than historic levels, all deployed against fueling demand for each of our brands. We've dialed up marketing efforts by balancing art and science to grow market share, to acquire new customers and drive profitable growth. 
First, the art. Fueled by new creative confidence, our brands are using their unique voices, optimism, values and cultural relevance to connect with customers rather than relying on discounts to drive [ sales and success ]. Whether it's Old Navy and Grammy-nominated recording artist, H.E.R., celebrating the reopening of America or Gap turning to TikTok fans to choose the next color for its iconic logo hoodie after a viral comeback of the classics or Banana Republic tapping into '80s nostalgia and our shared desire to get back out into the world with their recent vintage and travel-inspired capital collections or Athleta and Simone Biles partnering to help girls reach their full potential and passionately take on the world, people are choosing our brands for what they stand for. That is brand power. 
It's also essential that our strong brand creative is as effective as possible and showing up in the right places, and that's where the science comes in. We've updated our media mix. We've balanced investments between conversion with existing customers and top of the funnel to build awareness, brand love and reach new audiences. And then coupled with rigorous marketing effectiveness and a fully maximized third-party data set, we're seeing this pay off. Brand health is improving. We're growing our customer file and our brands are delivering results. 
Let me start with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered record sales with 18% comparable sales growth versus 2019. Strong storytelling, trend-right product and strategic discounting are bringing a new and more valuable customer in driving higher spend and margin dollar. Moving forward, the team is leveraging data science to allocate inventory to specific stores with great precision, further improving profitability. Old Navy will scale this capability in the back half, and we look forward to deploying it across the rest of our brands in 2022. 
And just last week, Old Navy brought the democracy of style and service together with their women's inclusive style sizing launch, BODEQUALITY. We now offer women's styles in every size with no price difference fully integrated in both stores and online. No other top 20 mass retailer does that. This is the largest integrated launch in the brand's history and an important growth driver for the business for years to come. The average woman in the U.S. wears a size 16 to 18, so with very few competitors in the plus size space, Old Navy is positioned to take a significant share of the $120 billion women's market. 
Moving to Gap. Gap is restoring relevance as an iconic American brand, and the North American business has reached a major inflection point with 12% comparable sales growth versus 2019. This is a testament to the hard work the team has done to fix the core business, focusing on execution at every turn. The assortment is better and tighter, product quality is better, discounts are lower, and when customers shop at Gap, they're met with a faster redesigned site and refreshed stores that are lighter and brighter, bringing the optimism our customers expect. This means Gap Brand is poised and ready to welcome new customers as we leverage the strength of partners to amplify our reach. Early results on Gap Home are encouraging, and YEEZY Gap has created a new iconic item, the round jacket, with 75% of customers who preordered being new to Gap. 
I mentioned earlier that our classic Gap hoodie is having a moment, so much so that we've reissued it in a vintage brown for preorder delivering this fall. And it's not just on TikTok. We've seen elevated search levels across Google, 7x more people search for the hoodie on gap.com in Q2 than a year ago. Data shows we are attracting a younger fan base with our teen logo hoodie outpacing adult sizes by 4x. I shared this all for a reason, this is a brand that is resonating. This is a brand that people care about and want to wear proudly across their chests. 
Next, Banana Republic. I'm pleased with the creative progress and momentum we saw at Banana Republic quarter-over-quarter. The dresses business rebound along with pants, shorts and woven tops as consumers shift back to vacation, occasion and workwear. Better execution online and a more relevant product assortment allowed the brand to pull back on discounting without resistance and attract new and younger customers. There's a lot of energy heading into the brand's fall relaunch and its vision of bringing affordable luxury to the market. Beautifully designed products like silk and cashmere and leather and enhanced site design, premium service and curated store experiences appealing to all senses will build over the next several months. 
And finally, Athleta, which delivered 27% growth versus 2019. As the country reopened, Athleta saw its performance lifestyle assortment accelerate as customers found versatility in styles that performs for travel, work and working out. As a perfect amplifier of the brand's values, Athleta's sponsorship of world-class athletes in Tokyo boosted brand awareness to 33% versus 26% last year according to YouGov. And next week, we will launch Athleta Online in Canada, which was made possible quickly due to our DC network and our existing infrastructure there. 
Athleta is a consumer curiosity that fuels every detail of its brand expression. Last month, it launched at Athleta Well, an immersive digital platform rooted in well-being designed to build loyalty, engagement and a community of empowered women. Members can engage in dynamic conversations with vetted experts on topics like outfitting, fitness, mental health and body positivity. They can also participate in one-of-a-kind experiences from interactive workshops to guided meditation and enjoy premium content from partners like Obe Fitness. This is an integral part of Athleta's evolution from a performance brand to a true lifestyle brand, and a key component of our strategy to develop enduring relationships with new and existing customers. 
Next, the power of our platform. We're embracing a try fast, learn fast, think big mentality to push for convenience and engaging customer experiences across the entire customer journey. With the debut of YEEZY Gap, we also launched an innovative out-of-the-box online experience, complete with preorder functionality and a digital waiting room. Our Instagram shopping pilot with Athleta and Old Navy was a successful test of distributed e-commerce, while our work on site speed and inventory availability are yielding Net Promoter Score improvement. Launches like Athleta are made possible with the power of our platform. We've created the digital community faster and more efficiently because of our scale and our tech might, and we're able to leverage this technology across all brands as we explore new ways to connect with customers. 
This quarter, we maintained our digital dominance with online delivering sales growth of 65% on a 2-year basis. Because of this growth, we're making investments across our distribution network to accommodate additional capacity and a new 2- to 3-day shipping promise for top-tier loyalty members. And meanwhile, our sourcing optimization efforts are ramping up as we look to reduce cost per package and simultaneously increase units per package. 
And finally, the power of our portfolio. In July, we unveiled our new integrated loyalty program, featuring a new value proposition anchored by faster shipping promise, a new tier structure, on-demand points redemption and the ability to do good through points donation. We know we build loyalty with our more than 65 million active customers by connecting deeply with them. This program allows us to engage personally with noncredit card customers through experiences, not just discounting to build lifetime value by migrating them up the value chain. 
As we add customers to our file and transition them from one and done to cross-brands and multichannel shoppers, we see a significant increase in revenue and value. Our growing card and loyalty program already has 40 million members. It has exceeded our expectations. We're proud to have issued our inaugural Equity & Belonging Report in June, summarizing development, actions and progress towards our 2025 commitments, a critical step as we work towards our goal of creating for all, with all. 
Looking ahead, we're prepared for back-to-school. Our kids and baby business has been a point of strength in both Old Navy and Gap. In between the 2 brands, we represent 9% of the market. That said, we are clear-eyed about the fluid ecosystem we operate within, from inflation to waste pressure or the recent surge in the Delta variant. The teams are mitigating supply chain headwinds from closures in the countries where we source and make our clothes and delays due to [ port congestion ] and transportation challenges. 
Thanks to the speed and scale of our omnichannel business, deep supplier relationships and the playbook we built at the start of the pandemic, we are advantaged here. We are stronger, we're healthier, we're faster and we're more a focused Gap Inc. than we were a year ago, and that gives me great confidence that our portfolio can navigate in headwinds to come. 
Our results show the acceleration of our Power Plan 2023. And as we shed unproductive sales and increase the speed of ideation and implementation, we are doubling down on 3 areas to drive sustainable long-term growth. First, we're looking at strategic expansion of the addressable market. As we study important trends in the market, like wellness and the homebody economy, we see a sizable future opportunity to compete in new categories. This shows up in product extensions like inclusive sizing, as I mentioned earlier, as well as home, intimate and fleece, which comprise a combined $326 billion in addressable markets. And when you couple that with our partner to amplify strategy, whether they're celebrity partnerships like YEEZY Gap or franchise, and licensing partnerships like Gap Home that expand our reach, that's a multiplier for growth. 
Next, as our momentum builds, we have an acute focus on customer lifetime value fueled by our marketing investment. Our work in loyalty, personalization and creating signature experiences across channels will help attract new customers while developing connections and stickiness with our current one. The AthletaWell community and partnership with fitness platform Obe and our upcoming work on fit transformation are ways to deepen the relationship with the customer and to encourage upselling and cross-selling and increase that lifetime value. 
And finally, digital transformation. We are investing more in technology this year than we ever have. Since moving to the cloud last October, every dollar we spend goes further towards growth and innovation versus modernization, innovation that could impact our entire portfolio of brands. And that speed of our technology deployment has increased our confidence to invest further. We are digitizing operations and increasing automation across inventory management, stores and key areas of the value chain to unlock cost and margins, a prioritizing work that will have long-term impact end-to-end. We believe it will radically redefine our operating cost structure and create an operating machine to support our long-term ambition for growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Katrina, I want to take a moment to celebrate Gap Inc.'s co-Founder, Doris Fisher, who celebrated her 90th birthday this week. As our company's first working mom and the arbiter of cool, she inspired generations of women to champion one another to follow their instincts with passion and heart. She and Don Fisher set the bar high with an eye towards what the consumer was craving and have instilled an owner culture that is crucially preserved. So tomorrow, in honor of her birthday, our team is dedicating our time to local communities in our first-ever Doris Fisher Day observance because, as she has said, ""We can always do more."" 
With that, I'll pass it over to Katrina."

As Sonia d",2483,"Thanks, Sonia, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Building on the momentum from Q1, we delivered very strong second quarter results, with the backdrop of a strong consumer demand for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar lifestyle brands remained high. As Sonia discussed, we believe this is the work of our team's tremendous progress on executing our Power Plan 2023 strategy. 
Of note are the following: one, our strategy is driving growth consistently. First, Old Navy and Athleta grew 21% and 35%, respectively, in Q2 versus 2019, and combined, represented 65% of company sales. Both brands delivered standout sales performance, led by their brand strength, omnichannel offerings and relevant product categories. Gap North America is growing with a 12% 2-year comp in the second quarter, demonstrating continued strength in our core North America market. This growth underscores the progress the brand is making in products and operations. We're pleased to have new leadership at Banana Republic, infusing creativity and improving customer experience, resulting in improved sales and operating performance in Q2 as the brand regains relevance. 
We're becoming digitally dominant. Our online business grew 65% in Q2 versus 2019. At over $6 billion in sales, our online channel is ranked #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales, and when combined with our well-located fleet, is a strategic advantage in serving our customers through the omnichannel lens. And we're targeting continued growth for all our brands, adding categories and reaching new addressable markets through extensions like home, plus size and community and wellness as we strive for sustainable momentum. 
Two, we're making the hard decisions to improve the company's economic model and drive management's focus on what matters. Our fleet rationalization is on track in driving significant economic value. Last year, we announced a plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America and expect that 75% will be completed by the end of this year. These closures, along with lease negotiations and higher online sales contributed to over 330 basis points of ROD leverage in Q2 versus 2019, and will contribute ongoing value for the remainder of the year. 
The transition of our European market to a new and more profitable operating model is underway and expected to be completed this year. We're making great progress on our goal of improving the performance and profitability of Gap Brands as we partner to amplify through asset-light models. And we successfully divested 2 smaller brands as we focus on our $4 billion purpose-driven lifestyle brands. 
And three, we're leveraging the power and scale of our shared platform to enable our growth agenda and help us navigate the near-term volatility in the market. Some relevant examples are as follows. Our technology spend, enabled by our recent cloud migration, has been meaningfully deployed against new digital capabilities, improving site performance and enhancing customer experience across all of our brands. Our new tiered loyalty program rollout, combined with our already strong cross-brand credit card program enables our 65 million known active customers to shop with rewards across our portfolio, maximizing customer lifetime value. Our scaled and automated DC network supports our online growth, and our improved loyalty shipping promise increases efficiency and drives down fulfillment costs. 
Strategic partnerships within our vendor base are allowing for rapid product innovation across the company such as the launch of Old Navy's PowerSoft active fabric sourced from fabric technology used in Athleta's Powervita collection, which has enabled Old Navy to dominate the value active space and has propelled the company's total active growth, with sales on target for $4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2021. And our strength and size in Canada will enable Athleta to enter that market in Q3 seamlessly. There are more, but these are just a few examples of how the power of the platform is a competitive advantage to growing all of our brands as we drive the synergy of the portfolio with the scale of the platform. 
Given our year-to-date performance and confidence in our strategy, we are raising our outlook for the year despite continuing macro headwinds. We now expect fiscal year 2021 sales to grow about 30% versus fiscal year 2020 and with an operating margin of about 7% on a reported basis and about 7.5% on an adjusted basis. This upwardly revised outlook puts us on an accelerated path towards our 2023 operating margin target of 10% plus. And we expect our fiscal year 2021 reported EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05, with adjusted EPS in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, a $0.50 increase from last quarter. 
COVID variants continue to cause volatility in certain markets, and we're actively working through supply chain constraints, inflation and wage pressure. We expect these challenges will continue for the remainder of the year but our teams have been hard at work, leveraging our scale advantages and strong relationships with vendors and carriers to navigate materials and other cost increases and secure necessary ocean and air capacity to navigate supply chain delays. 
Now turning to second quarter financials. Net sales for the quarter were up 5% versus 2019, and comp sales increased 12% on a 2-year basis. Permanent store closures and the divestitures of our Intermix and Janie & Jack businesses impacted sales by approximately 8 points. 
In our international markets, COVID-related store closures persisted for most of the quarter, resulting in an estimated 2 percentage point impact to sales versus 2019. We're pleased to report that while we're still carefully monitoring the COVID situation globally, as of the end of Q2, nearly all of our stores have reopened. Even as store sales start to rebound, outsized online growth continues. Enabled by investments in our omnichannel capabilities, customers are getting a great experience engaging with our brands regardless of how they choose to shop with us. The online business grew 65% versus 2019 and contributed 33% of total sales in the quarter. 
As noted in our press release, second quarter reported results include an SG&A charge of $19 million, primarily related to the decision to close our stores business in the U.K. and Ireland, which will ultimately drive improved profitability and remove fixed costs from our structure. For details on sales by brand, please refer to our earnings press release. 
In terms of gross margin, second quarter gross margin was 43.3%, reaching an historical high in the quarter and expanding 440 basis points versus 2019. The majority of the expansion resulted from ROD leverage from online growth, strategic North American store closures and the ongoing benefit of renegotiated rents for the remaining fleet. 
During the quarter, ROD leveraged by 330 basis points versus 2019, a trend that we expect to directionally carry forward in the second half of 2021. In addition, we were able to reduce discounting across all of our brands, resulting in meaningful average unit retail growth versus 2019 and significantly expanded product margins. Despite 130 basis points in higher shipping costs, primarily due to increased online demand, merchandise margins still improved versus 2019 by 110 basis points. 
Turning to SG&A. On a reported basis, SG&A of 33.6% deleveraged by 180 basis points compared to fiscal 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 33.1% of sales, 260 basis points higher than 2019 adjusted SG&A. We are acutely focused on driving down fixed expense to reinvest in demand generation as we look to grow sales in the long term. 
In Q2, our work on optimizing store expenses yielded about 150 basis points of benefit, helping to fund high-impact marketing, fueling brand health and relevance. Marketing drove 230 basis points of the increase to 2019 as we leaned into further digital marketing, celebrity partnerships and important growth initiatives like our integrated loyalty program launch. The success we're seeing, evidenced by improved profit margins and new customer acquisition, gives us confidence to lean into this important demand-driving strategy in the second half as we expect marketing spend of approximately 6% of sales for the full year. In addition, we experienced approximately 200 basis points in higher bonus accrual costs related to our strong financial outlook and pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Regarding operating margin, operating margin for the quarter was 9.7% on a reported basis. Adjusted operating margin of 10.2% increased 190 basis points versus 2019 adjusted operating margin. As the initiatives of our strategy take hold, we're encouraged to see the results through growing sales with improved profitability. 
Moving on to taxes and interest. The effective tax rate was 28% for second quarter of fiscal 2021. Second quarter net interest expense was $50 million. Regarding earnings on the quarter, reported earnings per share for Q2 were $0.67, up $0.23 compared to 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.70, an increase of $0.07 to 2019 adjusted EPS. 
Turning to inventory. Second quarter inventory ended up 2% compared to 2020 and down 2% to 2019. As part of our strategy to mitigate challenges within the supply chain due to capacity and COVID impact, we are leveraging our scale advantages to ensure we have appropriate inventory to fuel sales growth during the important holiday season. We currently expect third quarter ending inventory to be up mid-single digits compared to last year. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we paid the second quarter dividend of $0.12 per share and completed approximately $55 million in share repurchases as part of our plan to repurchase up to $200 million in shares this year to offset dilution. 
Earlier this month, we announced we will pay a third quarter dividend of $0.12, consistent with our plan to return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend program. We ended the quarter with 376 million shares outstanding. 
Finally, before we turn to our 2021 outlook, a brief update on the progress of our North America real estate plan and the transition of our European operating model. Year-to-date, we've closed 24 Gap and Banana Republic stores as part of our 350-store closure plan for North America. As a reminder, we expect we will be about 75% complete on that plan by the end of 2021 with 189 North America stores closed in 2020 and 75 stores expected to close this year. Old Navy and Athleta opened 25 and 13 stores, respectively, year-to-date on a path toward 30 to 40 openings at Old Navy and 20 to 30 openings at Athleta. 
Regarding the partner-to-amplify strategy we're deploying in our European market, we've announced that we are in discussions to move to a partnership model in France and Italy, and that while we will still maintain an online presence, we will be closing our store locations in the U.K. and Ireland. Year-to-date, we've closed 26 stores with the remaining 58 stores expected to close by the end of September. In the short term, we're not projecting a benefit in the back half of 2021 due to employee and lease-related costs as we wind down the stores business, but these strategic changes are expected to drive earnings accretion on an annual basis. For some helpful context, in fiscal 2019, the European market generated $539 million in net sales. About half of these sales were generated by the U.K. and Ireland stores at a slight operating loss. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our full year financial outlook. We're providing both the reported and adjusted outlook for the year. Earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 on a reported basis, which includes nonrecurring charges related to divestitures and the impact of changes to our European operating model totaling approximately $0.20. Excluding these charges, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25, a $0.50 increase to our prior guidance. We now expect sales growth of about 30% versus 2020. This incorporates the loss of sales due to store closures in the U.K. and Ireland. 
Reported operating margin is expected to be about 7%. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be about 7.5%, an increase of 150 basis points versus prior guidance and puts us well on the path to the 10%-plus goal laid out in our Power Plan 2023. 
As we developed this outlook, we considered a number of scenarios, carefully balancing the benefits related to our brand strength, new product offerings and loyalty program against the near-term expense from inflation and supply chain pressures, including sizable investments in air freight to partially mitigate longer lead times and shipping delays so that our inventories will be well positioned to compete during back-to-school and holiday. 
Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to expect to spend approximately $800 million for the full year. Our strong cash generation is enabling investments in our sustainable growth strategy. With a sharp focus on ROIC, we're targeting high return investments in digital, loyalty and supply chain capacity, in addition to store growth at Old Navy and Athleta. 
As I look forward, I'm energized by the following: first is that our strategic approach to growth is working. As Sonia articulated, we're driving growth in existing categories, and we're targeting new addressable share rooted in customer trends with initiatives like BODEQUALITY at Old Navy and Athleta Canada launching in Q3. And our study of the homebody economy and wellness trends may open the door to other new and exciting growth categories and services in 2022 and beyond. 
Next is our acute focus on customer lifetime value. With the formal launch of our integrated loyalty program in July, we're significantly increasing our ability to attract -- interact with customers in a more personalized and meaningful way. The program has already grown to over 40 million members. And based on the early results from the program's soft launch last fall, we expect to see increased purchase frequency and higher average order size from loyalty members. 
In addition to driving better transaction economics within a brand, the program encourages consumers to become multi-brand loyalists through our universal rewards program. Loyalty is just one way that we've doubled down on building deep relationships with our customers that result in stickiness and deliver value. 
Finally, our commitment to transforming the fixed costs in the business into demand-generating dollars for investment or EBIT expansion is showing results. Our fleet rationalization is deeply underway. Our smaller brands have been divested, and our partner to amplify strategy for international operations is in flight. We've also begun to pivot our technology investment towards the digitization of the enterprise. From our inventory management transformation and shipping optimization work, to productivity improvements in stores using technology and proven automation practices from our DCs, we are now developing a road map for leveraging the use of data and AI to unlock trapped costs, increase speed and aid in decision-making, proactively unlocking investment dollars to drive long-term growth.

So I'll start with the back-to-school component first around Old Navy. And as you know, for American families, this back-to-school season will be the first in over a year and Old Navy is prepared as is Gap Brand. And together, they hold 9% of kids and baby market share, so a position of strength. 
And as we think about that, as we think about their BODEQUALITY launch, which just happened, offering the entire women's assortment from double 0 to size 30 in stores and online at the same price, and one of the biggest launches in the brand's history, those 2 drivers of growth is something that we're confident in. And coupled with the science that Old Navy is building into its operating model, right, the inventory management transformations they're driving, as an example, which is aligned for a greater position of matching of supply/demand in their stores and in their DCs. So 3 great drivers, and I think we feel quite confident in our outlook and the momentum of Old Navy."

When it comes to the company and the acceleration you're referring to in revenue in the back half, I think what's exciting to us and what you heard in some of our prepared remarks is that our strategy really is about continuing to take market share in the core categories in which we dominate, so whether that's denim or active or kids and baby, but then also continue to supplement those core categories with new addressable markets like the BODEQUALITY launch, which will drive incremental value in the back half at Old Navy or the Athleta Canada entry, which will drive incremental value for Athleta, then combined with new lifetime value levers like loyalty launch, and then all supplemented by an incremental marketing spend that continues to drive profitable sales for us. 
So it's really this layering effect of initiatives and capabilities against our great brand strength that's driving that level of growth in the back half."

In terms of pricing power, we're seeing the margin expansion, as you mentioned, but we have a long runway here.

The first order bit was getting the art right, the brand positioning, the product, the marketing, the store experience, right, the fundamentals and the online experience. And we're making momentum there. 
But I would say that as we invest more in marketing, as we invest more in the technology to drive yield such as examples like inventory management or order logic or minimizing returns via the acquisition we announced today, these are all multiple drivers of growth. And then layer on top of that, our new loyalty program, which we all know is a proven mechanism to drive price and customer value. So we think we've got multiple prongs of price realization ahead of us. And I'll turn it over to Katrina to pick up the rest."

All of that gives us great confidence in the AUR expansion in the back half. 
I'm not going to comment on AUC, other than to say our outlook already contemplates any potential increases in AUC that would come from the incremental airfreight that we've put in. And as Sonia mentioned, and I mentioned, we are spending money on airfreight to compete in the back half so that we have the right inventory here to be able to continue our market share grab in the back half of the year. 
And so that's all contemplated in the raised guidance we gave today. And so we feel quite confident that our strategically advantaged supply chain is giving us the opportunity to compete well, combined with then the AUR and price elasticity that we have in the back half."

Next, we have advantaged transportation relationship. We booked advantaged -- cost advantaged air capacity 6 months ago. So we're not paying spot rates. We're being strategic here. We have vessel capacity that is fast and giving us speed advantage. So you couple all of these nodes in the supply chain together and you then apply that against our billion units a year.

So that's how to think about those 2 brands. 
And then at Banana Republic, we really do expect that with the fall season, we will begin to see their new marketing and execution on their website and in stores with products start to take hold, fall into holiday. And at Gap, I think you're seeing that the Core Gap is very strong in the North American market. I think we gave you some color on how to think about the U.K. and Ireland stores and the revenue that we'll see loss there, but then also the better profit impact going forward in 2022, what that will be. So I know lots of pieces to the puzzle, but that's how to think about the revenue by brand. 
As far as the air costs, we haven't quantified that, but it is significant. And we are obviously -- as Sonia said, we've actually taken a bunch of capacity in the market about 6 months ago. So we're actually evaluating daily, weekly, hourly what of that capacity to use and when.

Thanks for joining us today. As I reflect on the last 18 months, I'm inspired by the incredible transformation our teams have made in such a short time, despite an ongoing pandemic-related disruption to our bu",2012,"Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As I reflect on the last 18 months, I'm inspired by the incredible transformation our teams have made in such a short time, despite an ongoing pandemic-related disruption to our business and the broader economy. 
Coming off record sales performance in Q2, we had accelerated momentum heading into the back half before facing disruption to our supply chain, driven by the 2.5 month closure of our top manufacturing country, Vietnam, as well as port congestion, both of which affected our ability to fully meet strong customer demand. While we had planned into the known supply chain constraints as we entered the quarter, including COVID-related closures in Vietnam, the shock to our business persisted longer than anticipated as weeks turned into months. We have been all hands on deck to address these headwinds and the resulting impact on our business, proactively navigating holiday and beyond, ensuring that the customer is at the center of every decision we make. 
To secure our supply and meet the needs of our customers, we chose air freight over ocean vessels for a significant portion of our assortment, taking on extreme transitory costs. We're disappointed in the short-term impact on earnings. We made the choice to invest in our customer promise and build loyalty that will help sustain growth over the long term. Katrina will go into greater detail on our mitigation efforts later. 
Overall, we continue to believe the scale of our supply chain is a material advantage. We have deep relationships with our manufacturers across multiple countries of origin optimized for cost, speed and expertise. And we have strong transportation partners, offering speed advantage and industry-leading rates. That said, learnings from this crisis will not go to waste. We're using them as an opportunity to accelerate digitization efforts that were already underway across our product-to-market process. 
There was a sizable increase in the enterprise clock speed on transformative initiatives as we combated the current crisis with an eye on a better future faster. For example, we're adding supply chain capabilities that will allow us to better anticipate the unexpected. We've made significant progress digitizing core operating processes with a targeted focus on inventory management, loyalty and personalization. And we're transforming product creation by using digital tools to unlock speed and efficiency. All of these work will pay forward in 2022 and beyond. These near-term pressures have not distracted us from our core strategy. 
We have an acute focus on what really matters, our unique, ownable assets. It's because of the simple consumable and executable strategy we shared in October of last year, our Power Plan 2023, The Gap Inc. is in a stronger, more resilient position to date than we were entering this fiscal year. Even in the face of current headwinds, I'm confident this is true. Our brands are healthy. Demand for our product is strong and we have pricing power with average unit retail contributing to the highest gross margin in over a decade. 
We are becoming digitally-led. Online sales grew 48% in the quarter compared to 2019, representing 38% of total sales, and our migration to the cloud has unlocked innovation in our tech portfolio. We will strategically shed an estimated $1 billion in sales by year-end versus 2019 by closing unproductive stores, divesting smaller brands and partnering our European business to drive focus and profitability. 
Nearly 3/4 of active customers are loyalty shoppers, and they are spending twice as much as nonloyalty customers. And we have fortified our strong balance sheet by restructuring long-term debt, allowing us to invest for growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders. To our team and partners around the world, thank you. I have watched you navigate, persevere and accelerate through these near-term challenges while executing our long-term strategy. Despite the supply chain disruption, comp sales were up 5% on a 2-year basis, with 3 of our 4 brands delivering positive 2-year comps. 
Net sales were down 1% to 2019, which includes an estimated 8% point impact due to supply chain headwinds. Our strategy is on track and is working. Let me walk you through how our Power Plan came to life in Q3. Starting with the power of our brands. Each of our billion-dollar brands is finding new and relevant ways to expand reach and cut through to the consumer. This is driving an increase in brand power and a decrease in discounting. 
Let me start with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered 8% sales growth versus 2019, a deceleration from the first half as the brand was disproportionately affected by inventory lateness during the quarter. Old Navy maintained its #1 rank in kids market share according to NPD and sustained its kids and baby growth trend from the first half with strong back-to-school performance. BODEQUALITY, Old Navy's inclusive sizing integration launched successfully in August. The brand more than doubles its extended size customer file since launch. 5% of customers who shopped extended sizes are new to the brand and more than 1/3 have shopped Old Navy before, but are new to the category. We are seeing strong extended size demand across fashion categories, a clear signal that our customer is craving trend choice lacking in the market. 
Moving to Gap. The momentum continues at Gap brand, particularly North America, with comparable sales up 13% versus 2019 and net sales nearly flat despite the almost 18 percentage points of revenue we shed through strategic store closures. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive comparable 2-year sales growth in North America as Gap brand improves the core health of the business from tighter assortments and better quality product to an increase in digital penetration and lighter and brighter stores. 
Gap reached a critical milestone in our Power Plan, concluding its strategic review of the European market, driving a more profitable business model by shuttering our U.K. stores and working with local partners to amplify growth. We have identified strong partners in the U.K., Ireland, France and Italy and together, are committed to serving and growing our Gap customers in Europe. 
Our newest Yeezy Gap icon, the Perfect Hoodie, delivered the most sales by an item in a single day in Gap.com history. With over 70% of the Yeezy Gap customers shopping with us for the first time, this partnership is unlocking the power of a new audience for Gap, Gen Z plus Gen X men from diverse background. 
Next, Banana Republic. We've successfully launched new brand positioning focused on acceptable luxury. Through unique storytelling and experiences, the brand is going back to its roots, igniting the adventure in all of us. Banana Republic reported a net sales decline of 18% versus 2019, and a negative 10% 2-year comp. Like Gap, we walked away from about 10 percentage points of unprofitable revenue due to strategic store closures. 
Product margins expanded during the quarter as luxury products like marino, leather, cashmere and silk resulted in increased average transaction, drawing higher-value customers willing to pay for great quality. 
And finally, Athleta delivered an outstanding quarter with 48% net sales growth versus 2019, using its unique and ownable mission to empower women and girls through the power of she. The brand is investing in new touch points that increased awareness and drove new customer acquisition, which has more than doubled versus Q3 2019. Athleta grew brand awareness of 33% versus 27% last year according to YouGov, by embracing celebrity partnerships, Simone Biles and Allyson Felix, who took to the world stage in Tokyo. 
The brand expanded into Canada with a launch of its online business and its first company-operated store in Vancouver and Toronto. And customers are quickly embracing Athleta well, their new immersive digital community rooted in well-being with the active user base growing 50% every month since launch. We believe this platform has tremendous potential over the coming years to revolutionize how we monetize vulnerable brand experiences. 
Next, the power of our platform and portfolio. We leveraged our size and scale to drive advantage for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar brands. Our leading omni platform provides customer convenience and engaging experiences, whether in store, on mobile or through curbside pickup. Our online sales grew 48% in the quarter compared to 2019, and we maintained our rank as #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales. 
Our sizable active customer file sits at 64 million, and those customers are spending more on average than they were 2 years ago. But the more important is that the health of our customer file is improving. Compared to 2019, a newly acquired customers are spending more with us than our existing customers with increased average transactions, average unit retail and basket size. We're pleased with the launch of our innovative Rewards program and our ability to build customer lifetime value. Now with more than 45 million members, our loyalists are 2x more likely to shop across brands, and 3x more likely to shop across channels. 
We fuel our brands through our scale technology advantage operations. We are investing capital to drive growth, reduce costs and increase speed and agility. To diversify and strengthen our business, we are also seeding new capabilities that will unlock additional value. For example, we acquired Draper, which we expect will power new e-commerce tools with 3DFit technology and we acquired CD4, our machine learning and AI acquisition with broad potential across sales, inventory and consumer insights. We have plans to scale these solutions in 2022 to build our core digital capability. This will help our brands lower return, boost in-stock levels, increase margins and deliver better customer experiences online and in stores across all 4 brands. 
The power of our portfolio comes to life through our leadership in key categories. Our strong Active and Fleece business and our Denim business are expected to generate revenue of $4 billion and $2 billion, respectively, this year, and our kids and baby business owns 9% market share across Old Navy, Gap and Athleta. Even as occasions and wear-to-work categories have strengthened, it's clear comfort and style will sustain. We're extending our customer reach across every age, body and occasion from value to premium through category expansion and new addressable markets. We can test and pilot 1 brand and then leverage learnings to scale across the rest. For example, starting our inclusive sizing rollout in Athleta and scaling at Old Navy with product quality or using Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic's strong presence and infrastructure in Canada to enable Athleta's quick and seamless entry into the market. It's the collective power of our brand that gives us scale advantage. 
We continue to innovate in sustainable sourcing with a focus on empowering women enabling opportunity and enriching community. Every industry will be impacted by climate change, and we are doing our part to mitigate this impact, both in our supply chain and on the communities where we operate. Earlier this month, the USAID, Gap Inc., Women and Water Alliance announced that we have empowered 1 million people to improve their access to clean water and sanitation, already halfway to our goal of reaching 2 million by 2023. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate robust apparel and accessory retail sales across the industry for the remainder of the year and into the next. That said, we are balancing the favorable consumer climate against current supply constraints. As I mentioned earlier, we are doing everything we can to improve our on-hand inventories versus fall. And still, we remain cautious given the current environment. 
One last, while the near-term headwinds and resulting impact on our performance are difficult, we remain focused on executing our strategy for long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on what matters, demand-generating investments in our billion-dollar brands fueled by cut-through creative, deploying data and science to drive efficiency in the way we work and restructuring our business to reduce cost. All of these allows us to emerge from the crisis, growing share, increasing brand health and delivering profitable growth long term. 
With that, I wish you and your families a happy Thanksgiving. Katrina?"

As Sonia said, we're deeply proud of the progress we're making to transform Gap Inc. through our Power Plan 2023. We have strong demand for our brands and our fleet optimization through store closures, international partnerships and divestitures is progressing well and adding value. 
Our operating margin remains on track to hit 10% by 2023, in line with our plan, even as we navigate these near-term disruptions. Our balance sheet fortified with our recent debt restructuring enables us to invest in our business to drive growth while returning cash to shareholders. 
The core tenets of our Power Plan 2023 strategy are well underway in delivering value. While we're confident with our strategy, widely reported worsening global supply chain issues meaningfully impacted our third quarter performance. We lost approximately $300 million of revenue or 8 percentage points of sales growth on a 2-year basis due to longer transit which led to on-hand inventory. The backlog at U.S. ports to half of the year, resulting in up to 3 continuous weeks of unanticipated delays to fall product deliveries throughout the quarter. 
In addition, while our production capacity is largely globally diversified, approximately 30% of our product is produced in Vietnam, where factory closures extended to over 2.5 months, significantly longer than initially anticipated. Our average on-hand inventory in Q3 was 11% below fiscal year 2019. So despite strong sell-through trends, we lost volume as a result of limited supply. 
While our brands all experienced delays in styles and sizes that limited their ability to fully meet strong demand, Old Navy was disproportionate. We believe these supply chain disruption impacts to our sales and margins are transitory, although will persist in Q4 and potentially into early next year. With that, we've taken some near-term actions to proactively improve supply for holiday, and we're using the learnings from acute supply crisis to accelerate new capabilities for 2022 that we believe will help to better mitigate logistics challenges and more profitably increase speed to market go forward. 
Let me touch on some efforts. First, in incremental air capacity to support holiday inventory. In addition to an estimated $100 million of air costs incurred in Q3, we've also invested approximately $350 million in Q4 airfreight to further expedite holiday delivery. [indiscernible] we have routed a modest portion of our inventory to East Coast ports to bypass the congestion in the L.A. Long Beach port. While we aspire to improve our on-time deliveries for holiday by adding air capacity and utilizing alternate ports, the supply chain situation continues to be volatile. [indiscernible] are behind on holiday production ramping up slowly, ongoing port delays are worsening and air charters are causing new airport congestion. 
Our mitigation efforts are driving significant transitory costs, but we're focused on providing our customers with the products they love during the holiday season has and preserving market share and maintaining customer loyalty. 
We remain cautious in our outlook for the balance of the year and our [indiscernible] to $0.45 on a reported basis and $1.25 to $1.40 per share on an adjusted basis. We are updating our guidance solely based on the acute revenue and margin impact. This range now reflects the estimated lost sales from supply disruptions in the second half of 2021 to be $550 million to $650 million [indiscernible] chosen to incur as we seek to meet as much customer demand as possible. And we are confident that when adjusting for these substantial [indiscernible] our underlying business is ahead of plan, and we will emerge strong in 2022 and beyond. 
As we look to 2022, we are adding new capabilities that will enable with more flexibility and significantly less airfreight. Beginning with summer 2022, our teams have added the expected longer port delay times into product booking deadlines, which we believe will enable us to ship goods largely by ocean for on-time deliveries. In addition, Old Navy has now accelerated its use of digital product creation for the majority of its fall orders with vendors. This has added speed to the pipeline as the breakthrough and efficiency for the brand. 
Also to increase geographic diversification and flexibility, we expect to leverage more multinational vendors. And we will begin to deploy AI from our recent CD4 acquisition to better drive inventory in-stock in our stores. AI, combined with ongoing inventory management transformation efforts and the leverage of our new loyalty program gives us confidence in the sustainability of strong average unit retails in 2022. 
Now turning to third quarter financials. Before I get into specific results, I'd like to note that there are select charges we incurred in the quarter that are excluded from our adjusted financials related to restructuring our long-term debt market to a partnership model. I'll provide more details on these as I talk through the results. 
Starting with sales. Net sales were down 1% to 2019 with our Q3 sales deceleration from the first half of the year due to supply chain issues. Comp sales improved 5%. We're particularly pleased with the 2-year comp growth with Old Navy up 6%; Gap Global up 3%; and North America up 13%; and Athleta, up 41%. All while navigating acute supply issues. And while Banana Republic's 2-year comp was down 10%, the brand made progress in the quarter through its product and customer experience relaunch. Our strong e-commerce channel continues to be an advantage as online sales were up 48% compared to 2019, contributing 38% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% of total sales in Q3 2019. 
Moving to gross margin. Third quarter reported gross margin was 42.1%, an increase of 310 basis points versus 2019. Excluding impacts related to the transition of our European business to a partnership model, adjusted gross margin of 41.9% for the quarter represent [indiscernible] closures and renegotiated rents. Merchandise margins were down just 10 basis points despite nearly 2 basis points of higher online shipping costs and about 250 basis points in short-term headwinds related to airfreight. Product acceptance was strong across all brands with our overall Q3 discount rate at the lowest level in 5 years. 
Turning to SG&A. Reported SG&A, which includes $26 million in charges related to the transition of our European operating model was 38.3% of sales, deleveraging 470 basis points compared to Q3 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 37.6% of sales, 610 basis points above 2019 adjusted SG&A. 
We continue to execute our strategy of driving down fixed costs while investing a portion of those costs into demand generation in the form of marketing and technology. Fixed costs have been significantly reduced as we successfully closed stores in North America, divested of 2 brands earlier this year and reached partnership agreements for our European markets. 
Marketing, up 360 basis points versus 2019, supported the rollout of our new initiatives, particularly loyalty, inclusive sizing at Old Navy and the brand relaunch at Banana Republic, and is a major contributor to our low discount rates. 
The balance of Q3 investments were primarily focused on technology to build out our digital and supply chain capabilities as well as on higher bonus accruals and versus a low 2019 baseline as no meaningful incentive payouts were granted in that year based on performance. The investments we're making today are long-term differentiators, and we're committed to our strategy while remaining prudent even in the face of near-term supply headwinds. 
Regarding operating margin. Operating margin for the quarter was 3.9% on a reported basis. Excluding $17 million in charges related to our European market transition, adjusted operating margin was 4.3%, which as I noted earlier, includes the impact of an estimated $300 million in lost sales due to constrained inventory in addition to approximately $100 million in nonstructural airfreight costs. 
Moving on to interest and tax. During the quarter, we restructured our long-term debt by retiring all of our $2.25 billion senior secured notes and issuing $1.5 billion of lower coupon unsecured senior notes. Through this debt restructuring, we were able to reduce our overall debt balance, achieve material interest savings, approximately $140 million on an annual basis beginning in 2022, and unencumber our real estate assets previously pledged as collateral. 
We incurred a $325 million nonrecurring charge related to debt extinguishment in the quarter. Q3 net interest was $43 million. Full year net interest is now expected to be $163 million. Looking beyond 2021, we expect annual net interest expense of around $70 million. The effective tax rate was 29% for the third quarter, excluding the impact from fees related to debt extinguishment and the charge changes to our European operating model, the adjusted effective tax rate was 20%. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be about 23% on a reported basis and about 26% on an adjusted basis. 
Regarding earnings on the quarter, Q3 reported earnings reflect a loss of $0.40 per share. Excluding fees associated with our long-term debt restructuring and the transition of our European markets to a partnership model, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.27. 
Turning to inventory. Inventory delays worsened throughout the quarter, and our Q3 sales down 1% versus 2019 outpaced average on-hand inventory of down 11% to 2019. Third quarter inventory ended flat to 2019 and down 1% versus 2020, with average on-hand inventory down 7% and in-transit up 16% versus last year. 
On-hand inventory at the end of the quarter remained seasonally relevant with markdowns below Q3 fiscal '19 quarter end levels. We expect Q4 ending inventory to be up high single digits versus last year, although this point-in-time outlook may change given continued volatility in the supply chain. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended Q3 with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we continue to earn -- to return cash to shareholders, paying a Q3 dividend of $0.12 per share and repurchasing $73 million in shares as part of our current plan to offset dilution. And earlier this month, we announced a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share. 
Looking at our global store fleet, our plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic North America stores is expected to be approximately 75% complete by the end of the year. And with the recent announcement of our agreement to transition to a partner model in Italy, we've now concluded an important phase of the restructure of our European market. All markets are expected to be transferred to our new partners in early 2022. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our full year financial outlook, which we are downwardly revising solely based on the acute impact of sales and margin of the supply chain disruptions. Full year 2021 reported earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.60, which includes net charges of $445 million, comprised of $325 million in fees related to the restructuring of our long-term debt and approximately $120 million related to divestitures and the transition of our European business model to a -- European business to a partnership model. Excluding these charges and associated tax impacts, full year 2021 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.40.
This updated guidance now includes the following assumptions: first, we expect 2021 full year revenue growth of about 20% versus 2020. This range now reflects the expected lost sales from supply disruptions in the second half of 2021 of approximately $550 million to $650 million, including an estimated $300 million from Q3 and an estimated $250 million to $350 million in Q4. Second, we expect full year nonstructural air freight to be approximately $450 million. We consciously chose to air approximately 35% of our holiday product given the 2.5-month delays from Vietnam closures in Q3 and the over 3-week West Coast port delays so that we can give our customers as much holiday product as we can to deliver on their expectations. While this is material to our profitability, we believe it is necessary to further mitigate sales losses and retain customers for the long term. 
With the added air cost and the meaningful sales impact from supply constraints, we now expect full year 2021 reported operating margin to be about 4.5%, with adjusted operating margin at about 5% for fiscal 2021. This is inclusive of short-term air costs in the back half impacting operating margin by about 270 basis points. Full year capital spend is still expected to be approximately $800 million. 
In summary, when adjusting for the acute impact of supply chain disruptions, we are still expecting the year to end at or above our original plan for 2021, demonstrating that our underlying business trends are quite strong and providing real momentum. 
The progress we've made on our Power Plan 2023 strategy in the face of these challenges highlights the strength of our core business and the health of our brands, and we remain confident in our path as we move toward a 10% operating margin in 2023. 
With that, we'll open it up for Q&A."

So as we said on the call, we have amped up the airfreight for holiday in an effort to really navigate the lengthening port delays as well as the late opening of Vietnam. And there's a range of possible outcomes for how that could play through the holiday season. And so we'll see where that lands with holiday inventory. 
As it relates to the carryover into January and February, the teams have been really looking at -- for Vietnam, in particular, what units based on the closures do we need to cancel so that we didn't take them at all. What units can get reflowed into a future season. And then what units are we going to potentially pack and hold for next year. We proved this past year in the front half that pack and hold was a good strategy for us. 
And so if we think that things are going to be too late for the holiday season, we won't put in stores or online and have them generate markdowns and said we'll hold them for next year. So we're using a variety of things to help really navigate the current inventory situation so that we don't end up with a January or February inventory liability issue."

And so our bet was to stay on the office and have products here to service in holiday, and that's what's included in our outlook. 
We do think that even with the lumpiness of the quarter, we are on track to our power plan first year. And as we move into next year, we'll share more at the year-end, but we're confident about navigating that. So I think that through the price gains we've seen across all 4 of our brands, as exemplified by the Q3 margins. We think that, that can continue through a combination of the investments we've made in marketing, the strong product acceptance we're seeing as well as the enabling capabilities such as personalized pricing and inventory management optimization are key levers to continue the charge over the coming years, and price gains across the company.

And when we guided, we had baked in some disruption from Vietnam as we've seen in other countries, about 2- to 3-week closures as well as a 5-day port delay because that is what we have seen, that's what we had forecasted, therefore, go forward. 
What actualized was, as we know, much more dramatic. We had a 2.5 month shutdown of Vietnam, which is our top sourcing country, and for Old Navy, the slightly higher, particularly for women. And so the compounding effect of that as well as the worsening port is the new news. And so as we thought about the palpable maybe, the momentum, even in Q3, the growth in the Net Promoter Score and the growth and brand awareness through its BODEQUALITY launch, we made the decision to invest in airfreight in a substantial way to compete in holiday. So that's where we are right now. 
We think that the majority of the -- all the sales loss, in fact, is due to supply chain loss and Old Navy entered the quarter quite lean in inventory because of the strong demand in the first half, leaner than the portfolio. And then you exacerbate that with the out-of-stocks due to the supply constraints out of Vietnam and the port. And so that's really what we're navigating in the short term. We do believe it's transitory. We do believe that maybe is incredibly healthy, and has had, I think, all the indicators, the price realization, the brand health, the Net Promoter Score, the loyalty customers, the age of the customer with new customers joining that are younger, all of that abodes to the right bet to play offense for Old Navy."

And so all of that gives us confidence that this year, when you take out the supply chain impacts, would have been well ahead of our original Power Plan 2023 for this year and more in line with the guidance we provided back in August. So we're confident that we'll get through this. 
As we talked about before, we are looking forward, we're adding the supply chain delays from the ports to our buying timelines for summer. And then Old Navy is accelerating its move to digitizing product creation for fall, all of which we think will enable us to navigate next year with much less air freight, and we can see line of sight then to recovering the lost sales with better supply. So more to come when we get into next year, but we do see that this year would have been ahead of plan, and we have line of sight to mitigating these costs and sales losses going forward."

So those are areas that we've made a lot of progress on that affect broad SG&A as well as our store operations. That's where that gives a little bit more color on SG&A. We're very, very committed to digitizing our core operations so that our fixed SG&A costs in our 3-year plan continue to be a competitive advantage."

That's 250 basis points, I think, for the full year. If my math is right, that would get you halfway there to 7.5% and then to 10%. I guess, that's my -- I guess my 2 questions. One, is that the right way to think about it? Is it onetime? Or is some of it is going to stick? And then as we build to 10%, is this going to be kind of an even build over the next 24 months?

So you're thinking about that correctly. 
And then we'll give you more on how it will pace out 2022 versus 2023. But I think what Sonia and I would say is by the end of this year, we're really proud that, I would say 75% of the core restructuring of the company is largely behind us. When you think about closing the North America stores, divesting of our 2 smaller brands, getting our 3 countries in Europe partnered, we do feel like we got the debt restructured in the third quarter. We do feel like we've made really good progress against the restructuring plan. And so the next 2 years really are going to be about driving now the optimization of that healthy core with these digitization efforts that we think will start to add value, as we talked about through inventory management, through lower return rates and through automation of some of our core processes to try and drive cost out. But we'll talk more about pacing when we get to the end of the year, but that's the way to think about that 10% operating margin."

We continue to believe that the scale of our supply chain has always been an advantage right? It shows up in better rates and better unit cost and access to last mile. And so that's advantage. 
Now that said, we are using this as an opportunity to find ways to further insulate ourselves. And so while we expected the shutdown to be similar to other countries, a couple of weeks, for example, I think the government delay was substantially longer in Vietnam, especially South Vietnam, where we were most exposed and in maybe women's where we were most exposed. So it was outside of our expectations. 
Going forward, we're focused on multinational vendors as opposed to single point partners as well as the digitizing of the product creation process, which will really let us reduce cycle times and lead times in our product-to-market model. So I think we're using this crisis as an opportunity as we did last year to accelerate some of the key components of our Power Plan 2023 including digitization, including supply chain, transformation and inventory management transformation, which are all opportunities that we see leaning into to move us forward."

Thanks for joining us today. As I reflect on the last 18 months, I'm inspired by the incredible transformation our teams have made in such a short time, despite an ongoing pandemic-related disruption to our business and the broader economy. 
Coming off record sales performance in Q2, we had accelerated momentum heading into the back half before facing disruption to our supply chain, driven by the 2.5 month closure of our top manufacturing country, Vietnam, as well as port congestion, both of which affected our ability to fully meet strong customer demand. While we had planned into the known supply chain constraints as we entered the quarter, including COVID-related closures in Vietnam, the shock to our business persisted longer than anticipated as weeks turned into months. We have been all hands on deck to address these headwinds and the resulting impact on our business, proactively navigating holiday and beyond, ensuring that the customer is at the center of every decision we make. 
To secure our supply and meet the needs of our customers, we chose air freight over ocean vessels for a significant portion of our assortment, taking on extreme transitory costs. We're disappointed in the short-term impact on earnings, but we made the choice to invest in our customer promise and build loyalty that will help sustain growth over the long term. Katrina will go into greater detail on our mitigation efforts later. 
Overall, we continue to believe the scale of our supply chain is a material advantage. We have deep relationships with our manufacturers across multiple countries of origin optimized for cost, speed and expertise. And we have strong transportation partners offering speed advantage and industry-leading rates. That said, learnings from this crisis will not go to waste. We're using them as an opportunity to accelerate digitization efforts that were already underway across our product-to-market process. 
There was a sizable increase in the enterprise clock speed on transformative initiatives as we combated the current crisis with an eye on a better future faster. For example, we're adding supply chain capabilities that will allow us to better anticipate the unexpected. We've made significant progress digitizing core operating processes with a targeted focus on inventory management, loyalty and personalization. And we're transforming product creation by using digital tools to unlock speed and efficiency. All this work will pay forward in 2022 and beyond. These near-term pressures have not distracted us from our core strategy. 
We have an acute focus on what really matters, our unique ownable assets. It's because of the simple consumable and executable strategy we shared in October of last year, our Power Plan 2023, The Gap Inc. is in a stronger, more resilient position today than we were entering this fiscal year. Even in the face of current headwinds, I'm confident this is true. Our brands are healthy,  demand for our product is strong, and we have pricing power with average unit retail contributing to the highest gross margins in over a decade. 
We are becoming digitally-led. Online sales grew 48% in the quarter compared to 2019, representing 38% of total sales, and our migration to the cloud has unlocked innovation in our tech portfolio. We will strategically shed an estimated $1 billion in sales by year-end versus 2019 by closing unproductive stores, divesting smaller brands and partnering our European business to drive focus and profitability. 
Nearly 3/4 of active customers are loyalty shoppers, and they are spending twice as much as nonloyalty customers. And we have fortified our strong balance sheet by restructuring long-term debt, allowing us to invest for growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. To our team and partners around the world, thank you. I have watched you navigate, persevere and accelerate through these near-term challenges while executing our long-term strategy. Despite the supply chain disruption, comp sales were up 5% on a 2-year basis, with 3 of our 4 brands delivering positive 2-year comps. 
Net sales were down 1% to 2019, which includes an estimated 8% point impact due to supply chain headwinds. Our strategy is on track and is working. Let me walk you through how our Power Plan came to life in Q3. Starting with the power of our brands. Each of our billion-dollar brands is finding new and relevant ways to expand reach and cut through to the consumer. This is driving an increase in brand power and a decrease in discounting. 
Let me start with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered 8% sales growth versus 2019, a deceleration from the first half as the brand was disproportionately affected by inventory lateness during the quarter. Old Navy maintained its #1 rank in kids market share according to NPD and sustained its kids and baby growth trend in the first half with strong back-to-school performance. BODEQUALITY, Old Navy's inclusive sizing integration launched successfully in August. The brand more than doubled its extended size customer file since launch. 15% of customers who shopped extended sizes are new to the brand and more than 1/3 have shopped Old Navy before, but are new to the category. We are seeing strong extended size demand across fashion categories, a clear signal that our customer is craving trend choice lacking in the market. 
Moving to Gap. The momentum continues at Gap brand, particularly North America, with comparable sales up 13% versus 2019 and net sales nearly flat despite the almost 18 percentage points of revenue we shed through strategic store closures. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive comparable 2-year sales growth in North America as Gap brand improves the core health of the business from tighter assortments and better quality product to an increase in digital penetration and lighter and brighter stores. 
Gap reached a critical milestone in our Power Plan, concluding its strategic review of the European market, driving a more profitable business model by shuttering our U.K. stores and working with local partners to amplify growth. We have identified strong partners in the U.K., Ireland, France and Italy, and together are committed to serving and growing our Gap customers in Europe. 
Our newest Yeezy Gap icon, the Perfect Hoodie, delivered the most sales by an item in a single day in Gap.com history. With over 70% of the Yeezy Gap customers shopping with us for the first time, this partnership is unlocking the power of a new audience for Gap, Gen Z plus Gen X men from diverse background. 
Next, Banana Republic. We've successfully launched new brand positioning focused on acceptable luxury. Through unique storytelling and omni experiences, the brand is going back to its roots, igniting the adventure in all of us. Banana Republic reported a net sales decline of 18% versus 2019, and a negative 10% 2-year comp. Like Gap, we walked away from about 10 percentage points of unprofitable revenue due to strategic store closures. 
Product margins expanded during the quarter as luxury products like merino, leather, cashmere and silk resulted in increased average transaction, drawing higher-value customers willing to pay for great quality. 
And finally, Athleta delivered an outstanding quarter with 48% net sales growth versus 2019, using its unique and ownable mission to empower women and girls through the power of she. The brand is investing in new touch points that increased awareness and drove new customer acquisition, which has more than doubled versus Q3 2019. Athleta grew brand awareness of 33% versus 27% last year according to YouGov, by embracing celebrity partnerships, Simone Biles and Allyson Felix, who took to the world stage in Tokyo. 
The brand expanded into Canada with a launch of its online business and its first company-operated store in Vancouver and Toronto. And customers are quickly embracing Athleta well, their new immersive digital community rooted in well-being with the active user base growing 50% every month since launch. We believe this platform has tremendous potential over the coming years to revolutionize how we monetize vulnerable brand experiences. 
Next, the power of our platform and portfolio. We leveraged our size and scale to drive advantage for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar brands. Our leading omni platform provides customer convenience and engaging experiences, whether in store, on mobile or through curbside pickup. Our online sales grew 48% in the quarter compared to 2019, and we maintained our rank as #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales. 
Our sizable active customer file sits at 64 million, and those customers are spending more on average than they were 2 years ago. But the more important is that the health of our customer file is improving. Compared to 2019, newly acquired customers are spending more with us than our existing customers with increased average transactions, average unit retail and basket size. We're pleased with the launch of our innovative rewards program and our ability to build customer lifetime value. Now with more than 45 million members, our loyalists are 2x more likely to shop across brands and 3x more likely to shop across channels. 
We fuel our brands through our scale technology advantage operations. We are investing capital to drive growth, reduce costs and increase speed and agility. To diversify and strengthen our business, we are also seeding new capabilities that will unlock additional value. For example, we acquired Drapr, which we expect will power new e-commerce tools with 3D fit technology and we acquired CD4, our machine learning and AI acquisition with broad potential across sales, inventory and consumer insights. We have plans to scale these solutions in 2022 to build our core digital capability. This will help our brands lower return, boost in-stock levels, increase margins and deliver better customer experiences online and in stores across all 4 brands. 
The power of our portfolio comes to life through our leadership in key categories. Our strong Active and Fleece business and our Denim business are expected to generate revenue of $4 billion and $2 billion, respectively, this year, and our kids and baby business owns 9% market share across Old Navy, Gap and Athleta. Even as occasions and wear-to-work categories have strengthened, it's clear comfort and style will sustain. We're extending our customer reach across every age, body and occasion from value to premium through category expansion and new addressable markets. We can test and pilot 1 brand and then leverage learnings to scale across the rest. For example, starting our inclusive sizing rollout in Athleta and scaling at Old Navy with product quality or using Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic's strong presence and infrastructure in Canada to enable Athleta's quick and seamless entry into the market. It's the collective power of our brand that gives us scale advantage. 
We continue to innovate in sustainable sourcing with a focus on empowering women, enabling opportunity and enriching community. Every industry will be impacted by climate change, and we are doing our part to mitigate this impact, both in our supply chain and on the communities where we operate. Earlier this month, the USAID, Gap Inc., Women and Water Alliance announced that we have empowered 1 million people to improve their access to clean water and sanitation, already halfway to our goal of reaching 2 million by 2023. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate robust apparel and accessory retail sales across the industry for the remainder of the year and into the next. That said, we are balancing the favorable consumer climate against current supply constraints. As I mentioned earlier, we are doing everything we can to improve our on-hand inventories versus fall. And still, we remain cautious given the current environment. 
One last thought before I hand it over to Katrina. While the near-term headwinds and resulting impact on our performance are difficult, we remain focused on executing our strategy for long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on what matters, demand-generating investments in our billion-dollar brands fueled by cut-through creative, deploying data and science to drive efficiency in the way we work, and restructuring our business to reduce cost. All of this allows us to emerge from the crisis, growing share, increasing brand health and delivering profitable growth long term. 
With that, I wish you and your families a happy Thanksgiving. Katrina?"

As Sonia said, we're deeply proud of the progress we're making to transform Gap Inc. through our Power Plan 2023. We have strong demand for our brands and our fleet optimization through store closures, international partnerships and divestitures is progressing well and adding value. 
Our operating margin remains on track to hit 10% by 2023, in line with our plan, even as we navigate these near-term disruptions. Our balance sheet fortified with our recent debt restructuring enables us to invest in our business to drive growth while returning cash to shareholders. 
The core tenets of our Power Plan 2023 strategy are well underway in delivering value. While we're confident with our strategy, widely reported worsening global supply chain issues meaningfully impacted our third quarter performance. We lost approximately $300 million of revenue or 8 percentage points of sales growth on a 2-year basis due to longer transit, which led to on-hand inventory. The backlog at U.S. ports deteriorated meaningfully from the first half of the year, resulting in up to 3 continuous weeks of unanticipated delays to fall product deliveries throughout the quarter. 
In addition, while our production capacity is largely globally diversified, approximately 30% of our product is produced in Vietnam, where factory closures extended to over 2.5 months, significantly longer than initially anticipated. Our average on-hand inventory in Q3 was 11% below fiscal year 2019. So despite strong sell-through trends, we lost volume as a result of limited supply. 
While our brands all experienced delays in styles and sizes that limited their ability to fully meet strong demand, Old Navy was disproportionately impacted. We believe these supply chain disruption impacts to our sales and margins are transitory, although will persist in Q4 and potentially into early next year. With that, we've taken some near-term actions to proactively improve supply for holiday, and we're using the learnings from acute supply crisis to accelerate new capabilities for 2022 that we believe will help to better mitigate logistics challenges and more profitably increase speed to market going forward. 
Let me touch on some efforts. First, in the near term, we've secured incremental air capacity to support holiday inventory. In addition to an estimated $100 million of air costs incurred in Q3, we've also invested approximately $350 million in Q4 airfreight to further expedite holiday deliveries. And second, where possible, we have routed a modest portion of our inventory to East Coast ports to bypass the congestion in the L.A. Long Beach port. While we aspire to improve our on-time deliveries for holiday by adding air capacity and utilizing alternate ports, the supply chain situation continues to be volatile. Newly opened Vietnam factories are behind on holiday production ramping up slowly, ongoing port delays are worsening and air charters are causing new airport congestion. 
Our mitigation efforts are driving significant transitory costs, but we're focused on the long-term impact that delighting our customers with the products they love during the holiday season have and preserving market share and maintaining customer loyalty. 
We remain cautious in our outlook for the balance of the year and are updating our full-year 2021 EPS guidance range to $0.45 to $0.60 on a reported basis and $1.25 to $1.40 per share on an adjusted basis. We are updating our guidance solely based on the acute revenue and margin impacts from supply chain disruptions. This range now reflects the estimated lost sales from supply disruptions in the second half of 2021 to be $550 million to $650 million. In addition, our updated guidance range reflects approximately $450 million of transitory airfreight cost we have chosen to incur as we seek to meet as much customer demand as possible. And we are confident that when adjusting for these substantial disruptive impacts to 2021, our underlying business is ahead of plan, and we will emerge strong in 2022 and beyond. 
As we look to 2022, we are adding new capabilities that will enable us to navigate these disruptions with more flexibility and significantly less airfreight. Beginning with summer 2022, our teams have added the expected longer port delay times into product booking deadlines, which we believe will enable us to ship goods largely by ocean for on-time deliveries. In addition, Old Navy has now accelerated its use of digital product creation for the majority of its fall orders with vendors. This has added speed to the pipeline as the breakthrough and efficiency for the brand. 
Also to increase geographic diversification and flexibility, we expect to leverage more multinational vendors. And we will begin to deploy AI from our recent CD4 acquisition to better drive inventory in-stock in our stores. AI, combined with ongoing inventory management transformation efforts, and the leverage of our new loyalty program, gives us confidence in the sustainability of strong average unit retails in 2022. 
Now turning to third quarter financials. Before I get into specific results, I'd like to note that there are select charges we incurred in the quarter that are excluded from our adjusted financials, specifically costs related to restructuring our long-term debt and the transition of our European market to a partnership model. I'll provide more details on these as I talk through the results. 
Starting with sales. Net sales of $3.9 billion for the quarter were down 1% to 2019 with our Q3 sales deceleration from the first half of the year due to supply chain issues. Comp sales improved 5% on a 2-year basis. We're particularly pleased that 3 of our 4 brands delivered strong 2-year comp growth with Old Navy up 6%, Gap Global up 3% and North America up 13%, and Athleta up 41%, all while navigating acute supply issues. And while Banana Republic's 2-year comp was down 10%, the brand made progress in the quarter through its product and customer experience relaunch. Our strong e-commerce channel continues to be an advantage as online sales were up 48% compared to 2019, contributing 38% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% of total sales in Q3 2019. 
Moving to gross margin. Third quarter reported gross margin was 42.1%, an increase of 310 basis points versus 2019. Excluding impacts related to the transition of our European business to a partnership model, adjusted gross margin of 41.9% for the quarter represents the highest Q3 gross margin rate in over 10 years, expanding 290 basis points versus 2019 gross margin. This is primarily driven by 300 basis points in ROD leverage from higher online sales and lower rent occupancy and depreciation as a result of strategic foreclosures and renegotiated rents.
Merchandise margins were down just 10 basis points despite nearly 200 basis points of higher online shipping costs and about 250 basis points in short-term headwinds related to airfreight. Product acceptance was strong across all brands with our overall Q3 discount rate at the lowest level in 5 years. 
Turning to SG&A. Reported SG&A, which includes $26 million in charges related to the transition of our European operating model was 38.3% of sales, deleveraging 470 basis points compared to Q3 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 37.6% of sales, 610 basis points above 2019 adjusted SG&A. 
We continue to execute our strategy of driving down fixed costs while investing a portion of those costs into demand generation in the form of marketing and technology. Fixed costs have been significantly reduced as we successfully closed stores in North America, divested 2 brands earlier this year and reached partnership agreements for our European markets. 
Marketing, up 360 basis points versus 2019, supported the rollout of our new initiatives, particularly loyalty, inclusive sizing at Old Navy, and the brand relaunch at Banana Republic, and is a major contributor to our low discount rates. 
The balance of Q3 investments were primarily focused on technology to build out our digital and supply chain capabilities as well as on higher bonus accruals versus a low 2019 baseline as no meaningful incentive payouts were granted in that year based on performance. The investments we're making today are long-term differentiators, and we're committed to our strategy while remaining prudent even in the face of near-term supply headwinds. 
Regarding operating margin. Operating margin for the quarter was 3.9% on a reported basis. Excluding $17 million in charges related to our European market transition, adjusted operating margin was 4.3%, which as I noted earlier, includes the impact of an estimated $300 million in lost sales due to constrained inventory in addition to approximately $100 million in nonstructural airfreight costs. 
Moving on to interest and tax. During the quarter, we restructured our long-term debt by retiring all of our $2.25 billion senior secured notes and issuing $1.5 billion of lower coupon unsecured senior notes. Through this debt restructuring, we were able to reduce our overall debt balance, achieve material interest savings, approximately $140 million on an annual basis beginning in 2022, and unencumber our real estate assets previously pledged as collateral. 
We incurred a $325 million nonrecurring charge related to debt extinguishment in the quarter. Q3 net interest was $43 million. Full year net interest is now expected to be $163 million. Looking beyond 2021, we expect annual net interest expense of around $70 million. The effective tax rate was 29% for the third quarter, excluding the impact from fees related to debt extinguishment and the charge changes to our European operating model, the adjusted effective tax rate was 20%. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be about 23% on a reported basis and about 26% on an adjusted basis. 
Regarding earnings on the quarter, Q3 reported earnings reflect a loss of $0.40 per share. Excluding fees associated with our long-term debt restructuring and the transition of our European markets to a partnership model, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.27. 
Turning to inventory. Inventory delays worsened throughout the quarter, and our Q3 sales down 1% versus 2019 outpaced average on-hand inventory of down 11% to 2019. Third quarter inventory ended flat to 2019 and down 1% versus 2020, with average on-hand inventory down 7% and in-transit up 16% versus last year. 
On-hand inventory at the end of the quarter remained seasonally relevant with markdowns below Q3 fiscal '19 quarter end levels. We expect Q4 ending inventory to be up high single digits versus last year, although this point-in-time outlook may change given continued volatility in the supply chain. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended Q3 with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we continued to return cash to shareholders, paying a Q3 dividend of $0.12 per share and repurchasing $73 million in shares as part of our current plan to offset dilution. And earlier this month, we announced a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share. 
Looking at our global store fleet, our plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic North America stores is expected to be approximately 75% complete by the end of the year. And with the recent announcement of our agreement to transition to a partner model in Italy, we've now concluded an important phase of the restructure of our European market. All markets are expected to be transferred to our new partners in early 2022. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our full year financial outlook, which we are downwardly revising solely based on the acute impact of sales and margin of the supply chain disruptions. Full year 2021 reported earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.60, which includes net charges of $445 million, comprised of $325 million in fees related to the restructuring of our long-term debt and approximately $120 million related to divestitures and the transition of our European business model to a -- European business to a partnership model. Excluding these charges and associated tax impacts, full year 2021 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.40.
This updated guidance now includes the following assumptions: first, we expect 2021 full year revenue growth of about 20% versus 2020. This range now reflects the expected lost sales from supply disruptions in the second half of 2021 of approximately $550 million to $650 million, including an estimated $300 million from Q3 and an estimated $250 million to $350 million in Q4. Second, we expect full year nonstructural air freight to be approximately $450 million. We consciously chose to air approximately 35% of our holiday product given the 2.5-month delays from Vietnam closures in Q3 and the over 3-week West Coast port delays so that we can give our customers as much holiday product as we can to deliver on their expectations. While this is material to our profitability, we believe it is necessary to further mitigate sales losses and retain customers for the long term. 
With the added air cost and the meaningful sales impact from supply constraints, we now expect full year 2021 reported operating margin to be about 4.5%, with adjusted operating margin at about 5% for fiscal 2021. This is inclusive of short-term air costs in the back half impacting operating margin by about 270 basis points. Full year capital spend is still expected to be approximately $800 million. 
In summary, when adjusting for the acute impact of supply chain disruptions, we are still expecting the year to end at or above our original plan for 2021, demonstrating that our underlying business trends are quite strong and providing real momentum. The progress we've made on our Power Plan 2023 strategy in the face of these challenges highlights the strength of our core business and the health of our brands, and we remain confident in our path as we move toward a 10% operating margin in 2023. 
With that, we'll open it up for Q&A."

As you're thinking about the inventory cadence into the fourth quarter and holiday, it sounds like there may be some shipments that may be stuck on boats in the ports right around the time where those customers are really looking for that holiday season. How are you thinking about carryover inventory into January and February? And perhaps the more lapsing impacts of some of these supply chain delays and Vietnam's slow restarts into 1Q of next year?"

So as we said on the call, we have amped up the airfreight for holiday in an effort to really navigate the lengthening port delays as well as the late opening of Vietnam. And there's a range of possible outcomes for how that could play through the holiday season. And so we'll see where that lands with holiday inventory. As it relates to the carryover into January and February, the teams have been really looking at -- for Vietnam, in particular, what units based on the closures do we need to cancel so that we didn't take them at all. What units can get reflowed into a future season. 
And then what units are we going to potentially pack and hold for next year. We proved this past year in the front half that pack and hold was a good strategy for us. And so if we think that things are going to be too late for the holiday season, we won't put them in stores or online and have them generate markdowns, instead we'll hold them for next year. So we're using a variety of things to help really navigate the current inventory situation so that we don't end up with a January or February inventory liability issue."

So I think that through the price gains we've seen across all 4 of our brands, as exemplified by the Q3 margins. We think that, that can continue through a combination of the investments we've made in marketing, the strong product acceptance we're seeing, as well as the enabling capabilities such as personalized pricing and inventory management optimization as key levers to continue the charge over the coming years and price gains across the company.

So as you know, we left the first half of this year with really strong momentum at Old Navy maybe with 24% sales growth. And when we guided, we had baked in some disruption from Vietnam as we've seen in other countries, about 2- to 3-week closures as well as a 5-day port delay and because that is what we have seen, that's what we had forecasted, therefore, go forward. What actualized was, as you know, much more dramatic. We had a 2.5 month shutdown of Vietnam, which is our top sourcing country, and for Old Navy, the slightly higher, particularly for women. And so the compounding effect of that as well as the worsening port is the new news. And so as we thought about the health of Old Navy, the momentum, even in Q3, the growth in the Net Promoter Score and the growth and brand awareness through its BODEQUALITY launch, we made the decision to invest in airfreight in a substantial way to compete in holiday. So that's where we are right now. 
We think that the majority of the sales loss -- all the sales loss, in fact, is due to supply chain loss and Old Navy entered the quarter quite lean in inventory because of the strong demand in the first half, leaner than the portfolio. And then you exacerbate that with the out-of-stocks due to the supply constraints out of Vietnam and the port. And so that's really what we're navigating in the short term. We do believe it's transitory. We do believe that Old Navy is incredibly healthy, and has had, I think, all the indicators, the price realization, the brand health, the Net Promoter Score, the loyalty customers, the age of the customer with new customers joining that are younger, all of that abodes to the right bet to play offense for Old Navy."

And then in addition to that, it includes the close to $500 million of sales impact from supply constraints. And so all of that gives us confidence that this year, when you take out the supply chain impacts, would have been well ahead of our original Power Plan 2023 for this year and more in line with the guidance we provided back in August. So we're confident that we'll get through this. 
As we talked about before, we are looking forward, we're adding the supply chain delays from the ports to our buying timelines for summer. And then Old Navy is accelerating its move to digitizing product creation for fall, all of which we think will enable us to navigate next year with much less air freight, and we can see line of sight then to recovering the lost sales with better supply. So more to come when we get into next year, but we do see that this year would have been ahead of plan, and we have line of sight to mitigating these costs and sales losses going forward."

Should we assume that this is the new baseline of spending going forward? And when you realized during the third quarter that Old Navy would be low of inventory, was there any thought to perhaps cut back on marketing during the quarter so as not to disappoint the customer?

I'll let Sonia talk a little bit about the marketing piece."

And I'll just add on, look, we pulled back on payroll and other fixed costs that don't add value in the phase of lower sales, as you suggest Kimberly. But fundamentally, our strategy is working. And we have a fair amount of rigor around marketing effectiveness and marketing spend that gave us confidence that it was the right level of investment. And as we look at Q3 for Old Navy, in particular, with Net Promoter Score being up, despite the fact that we have stock-outs, where we know we did -- we had some disappointment. And with the fact that the brand awareness is up 8 points for a brand of Old Navy size, that's really dramatic and strong based on BODEQUALITY, the BODEQUALITY launch. 
So we think the marketing investments are right. We're focused on fixed cost elimination that's automating our stores processes, that's removing unproductive sales to store closures and the transition of our unprofitable international markets. So those are areas that we've made a lot of progress on that affect broad SG&A as well as our store operations. Hopefully, that's gives a little bit more color on SG&A. We're very, very committed to digitizing our core operations so that our fixed SG&A costs in our 3-year plan continue to be a competitive advantage."

I mean, is this transitory in the sense that it is, in your mind, onetime? I'm just trying to bridge the 5% margin today versus your 10% target in 2 years. That's 250 basis points, I think, for the full year. If my math is right, that would get you halfway there to 7.5% and then to 10%. I guess, that's -- I guess I have 2 questions. One, is that the right way to think about it? Is it onetime? Or is some of this going to stick? And then as we build to 10%, is this going to be kind of an even build over the next 24 months?

We'll see next year how much of it continues in the front half of the year. But fundamentally, this year would have been that 270 basis points higher without having to navigate these current issues. So you're thinking about that correctly. 
And then we'll give you more on how it will pace out 2022 versus 2023. But I think what Sonia and I would say is, by the end of this year, we're really proud that, I would say 75% of the core restructuring of the company is largely behind us. When you think about closing the North America stores, divesting of our 2 smaller brands, getting our 3 countries in Europe partnered, we do feel like -- we got the debt restructured in the third quarter, we do feel like we've made really good progress against the restructuring plan. And so the next 2 years really are going to be about driving now the optimization of that healthy core with these digitization efforts that we think will start to add value, as we talked about through inventory management, through lower return rates and through automation of some of our core processes to try and drive cost out. But we'll talk more about pacing when we get to the end of the year, but that's the way to think about that 10% operating margin."

And then, Katrina, we didn't talk much about any average hourly rate pressure in that SG&A line. Numbers are floating out there $15 to $17 and, historically, Gap's been at the forefront of leading that AHR initiative. So how are you thinking about that?

And those who don't manufacture there, had a natural advantage. We continue to believe that the scale of our supply chain has always been an advantage right? It shows up in better rates, in better unit cost, and access to last mile. And so that's advantage. Now that said, we are using this as an opportunity to find ways to further insulate ourselves. And so while we expected the shutdown to be similar to other countries, a couple of weeks, for example, I think, the government delay was substantially longer in Vietnam, especially South Vietnam, where we were most exposed and in Old Navy women's where we were most exposed. So it was outside of our expectations. 
Going forward, we're focused on multinational vendors as opposed to single point partners as well as the digitizing of the product creation process, which will really let us reduce cycle times and lead times in our product-to-market model. So I think we're using this crisis as an opportunity as we did last year to accelerate some of the key components of our Power Plan 2023 including digitization, including supply chain transformation and inventory management transformation, which are all opportunities that we see leaning into, to move us forward."

Thanks for joining us today. As I reflect on the last 18 months, I'm inspired by the incredible transformation our teams have made in such a short time, despite an ongoing pandemic-related disruption to our business and the broader economy. 
Coming off record sales performance in Q2, we had accelerated momentum heading into the back half before facing disruption to our supply chain, driven by the 2.5 month closure of our top manufacturing country, Vietnam, as well as port congestion, both of which affected our ability to fully meet strong customer demand. While we had planned into the known supply chain constraints as we entered the quarter, including COVID-related closures in Vietnam, the shock to our business persisted longer than anticipated as weeks turned into months. We have been all hands on deck to address these headwinds and the resulting impact on our business, proactively navigating holiday and beyond, ensuring that the customer is at the center of every decision we make. 
To secure our supply and meet the needs of our customers, we chose air freight over ocean vessels for a significant portion of our assortment, taking on extreme transitory costs. We're disappointed in the short-term impact on earnings, but we made the choice to invest in our customer promise and build loyalty that will help sustain growth over the long term. Katrina will go into greater detail on our mitigation efforts later. 
Overall, we continue to believe the scale of our supply chain is a material advantage. We have deep relationships with our manufacturers across multiple countries of origin optimized for cost, speed and expertise. And we have strong transportation partners offering speed advantage and industry-leading rates. That said, learnings from this crisis will not go to waste. We're using them as an opportunity to accelerate digitization efforts that were already underway across our product-to-market process. 
There was a sizable increase in the enterprise clock speed on transformative initiatives as we combated the current crisis with an eye on a better future faster. For example, we're adding supply chain capabilities that will allow us to better anticipate the unexpected. We've made significant progress digitizing core operating processes with a targeted focus on inventory management, loyalty and personalization. And we're transforming product creation by using digital tools to unlock speed and efficiency. All this work will pay forward in 2022 and beyond. These near-term pressures have not distracted us from our core strategy. 
We have an acute focus on what really matters, our unique ownable assets. It's because of the simple consumable and executable strategy we shared in October of last year, our Power Plan 2023, The Gap Inc. is in a stronger, more resilient position today than we were entering this fiscal year. Even in the face of current headwinds, I'm confident this is true. Our brands are healthy,  demand for our product is strong, and we have pricing power with average unit retail contributing to the highest gross margins in over a decade. 
We are becoming digitally-led. Online sales grew 48% in the quarter compared to 2019, representing 38% of total sales, and our migration to the cloud has unlocked innovation in our tech portfolio. We will strategically shed an estimated $1 billion in sales by year-end versus 2019 by closing unproductive stores, divesting smaller brands and partnering our European business to drive focus and profitability. 
Nearly 3/4 of active customers are loyalty shoppers, and they are spending twice as much as nonloyalty customers. And we have fortified our strong balance sheet by restructuring long-term debt, allowing us to invest for growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. To our team and partners around the world, thank you. I have watched you navigate, persevere and accelerate through these near-term challenges while executing our long-term strategy. Despite the supply chain disruption, comp sales were up 5% on a 2-year basis, with 3 of our 4 brands delivering positive 2-year comps. 
Net sales were down 1% to 2019, which includes an estimated 8% point impact due to supply chain headwinds. Our strategy is on track and is working. Let me walk you through how our Power Plan came to life in Q3. Starting with the power of our brands. Each of our billion-dollar brands is finding new and relevant ways to expand reach and cut through to the consumer. This is driving an increase in brand power and a decrease in discounting. 
Let me start with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered 8% sales growth versus 2019, a deceleration from the first half as the brand was disproportionately affected by inventory lateness during the quarter. Old Navy maintained its #1 rank in kids market share according to NPD and sustained its kids and baby growth trend in the first half with strong back-to-school performance. BODEQUALITY, Old Navy's inclusive sizing integration launched successfully in August. The brand more than doubled its extended size customer file since launch. 15% of customers who shopped extended sizes are new to the brand and more than 1/3 have shopped Old Navy before, but are new to the category. We are seeing strong extended size demand across fashion categories, a clear signal that our customer is craving trend choice lacking in the market. 
Moving to Gap. The momentum continues at Gap brand, particularly North America, with comparable sales up 13% versus 2019 and net sales nearly flat despite the almost 18 percentage points of revenue we shed through strategic store closures. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive comparable 2-year sales growth in North America as Gap brand improves the core health of the business from tighter assortments and better quality product to an increase in digital penetration and lighter and brighter stores. 
Gap reached a critical milestone in our Power Plan, concluding its strategic review of the European market, driving a more profitable business model by shuttering our U.K. stores and working with local partners to amplify growth. We have identified strong partners in the U.K., Ireland, France and Italy, and together are committed to serving and growing our Gap customers in Europe. 
Our newest Yeezy Gap icon, the Perfect Hoodie, delivered the most sales by an item in a single day in Gap.com history. With over 70% of the Yeezy Gap customers shopping with us for the first time, this partnership is unlocking the power of a new audience for Gap, Gen Z plus Gen X men from diverse background. 
Next, Banana Republic. We've successfully launched new brand positioning focused on acceptable luxury. Through unique storytelling and omni experiences, the brand is going back to its roots, igniting the adventure in all of us. Banana Republic reported a net sales decline of 18% versus 2019, and a negative 10% 2-year comp. Like Gap, we walked away from about 10 percentage points of unprofitable revenue due to strategic store closures. 
Product margins expanded during the quarter as luxury products like merino, leather, cashmere and silk resulted in increased average transaction, drawing higher-value customers willing to pay for great quality. 
And finally, Athleta delivered an outstanding quarter with 48% net sales growth versus 2019, using its unique and ownable mission to empower women and girls through the power of she. The brand is investing in new touch points that increased awareness and drove new customer acquisition, which has more than doubled versus Q3 2019. Athleta grew brand awareness of 33% versus 27% last year according to YouGov, by embracing celebrity partnerships, Simone Biles and Allyson Felix, who took to the world stage in Tokyo. 
The brand expanded into Canada with a launch of its online business and its first company-operated store in Vancouver and Toronto. And customers are quickly embracing Athleta well, their new immersive digital community rooted in well-being with the active user base growing 50% every month since launch. We believe this platform has tremendous potential over the coming years to revolutionize how we monetize vulnerable brand experiences. 
Next, the power of our platform and portfolio. We leveraged our size and scale to drive advantage for our 4 purpose-led billion-dollar brands. Our leading omni platform provides customer convenience and engaging experiences, whether in store, on mobile or through curbside pickup. Our online sales grew 48% in the quarter compared to 2019, and we maintained our rank as #2 in U.S. apparel e-commerce sales. 
Our sizable active customer file sits at 64 million, and those customers are spending more on average than they were 2 years ago. But the more important is that the health of our customer file is improving. Compared to 2019, newly acquired customers are spending more with us than our existing customers with increased average transactions, average unit retail and basket size. We're pleased with the launch of our innovative rewards program and our ability to build customer lifetime value. Now with more than 45 million members, our loyalists are 2x more likely to shop across brands and 3x more likely to shop across channels. 
We fuel our brands through our scale technology advantage operations. We are investing capital to drive growth, reduce costs and increase speed and agility. To diversify and strengthen our business, we are also seeding new capabilities that will unlock additional value. For example, we acquired Drapr, which we expect will power new e-commerce tools with 3D fit technology and we acquired CD4, our machine learning and AI acquisition with broad potential across sales, inventory and consumer insights. We have plans to scale these solutions in 2022 to build our core digital capability. This will help our brands lower return, boost in-stock levels, increase margins and deliver better customer experiences online and in stores across all 4 brands. 
The power of our portfolio comes to life through our leadership in key categories. Our strong Active and Fleece business and our Denim business are expected to generate revenue of $4 billion and $2 billion, respectively, this year, and our kids and baby business owns 9% market share across Old Navy, Gap and Athleta. Even as occasions and wear-to-work categories have strengthened, it's clear comfort and style will sustain. We're extending our customer reach across every age, body and occasion from value to premium through category expansion and new addressable markets. We can test and pilot 1 brand and then leverage learnings to scale across the rest. For example, starting our inclusive sizing rollout in Athleta and scaling at Old Navy with product quality or using Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic's strong presence and infrastructure in Canada to enable Athleta's quick and seamless entry into the market. It's the collective power of our brand that gives us scale advantage. 
We continue to innovate in sustainable sourcing with a focus on empowering women, enabling opportunity and enriching community. Every industry will be impacted by climate change, and we are doing our part to mitigate this impact, both in our supply chain and on the communities where we operate. Earlier this month, the USAID, Gap Inc., Women and Water Alliance announced that we have empowered 1 million people to improve their access to clean water and sanitation, already halfway to our goal of reaching 2 million by 2023. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate robust apparel and accessory retail sales across the industry for the remainder of the year and into the next. That said, we are balancing the favorable consumer climate against current supply constraints. As I mentioned earlier, we are doing everything we can to improve our on-hand inventories versus fall. And still, we remain cautious given the current environment. 
One last thought before I hand it over to Katrina. While the near-term headwinds and resulting impact on our performance are difficult, we remain focused on executing our strategy for long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on what matters, demand-generating investments in our billion-dollar brands fueled by cut-through creative, deploying data and science to drive efficiency in the way we work, and restructuring our business to reduce cost. All of this allows us to emerge from the crisis, growing share, increasing brand health and delivering profitable growth long term. 
With that, I wish you and your families a happy Thanksgiving. Katrina?"

As Sonia said, we're deeply proud of the progress we're making to transform Gap Inc. through our Power Plan 2023. We have strong demand for our brands and our fleet optimization through store closures, international partnerships and divestitures is progressing well and adding value. 
Our operating margin remains on track to hit 10% by 2023, in line with our plan, even as we navigate these near-term disruptions. Our balance sheet fortified with our recent debt restructuring enables us to invest in our business to drive growth while returning cash to shareholders. 
The core tenets of our Power Plan 2023 strategy are well underway in delivering value. While we're confident with our strategy, widely reported worsening global supply chain issues meaningfully impacted our third quarter performance. We lost approximately $300 million of revenue or 8 percentage points of sales growth on a 2-year basis due to longer transit, which led to on-hand inventory. The backlog at U.S. ports deteriorated meaningfully from the first half of the year, resulting in up to 3 continuous weeks of unanticipated delays to fall product deliveries throughout the quarter. 
In addition, while our production capacity is largely globally diversified, approximately 30% of our product is produced in Vietnam, where factory closures extended to over 2.5 months, significantly longer than initially anticipated. Our average on-hand inventory in Q3 was 11% below fiscal year 2019. So despite strong sell-through trends, we lost volume as a result of limited supply. 
While our brands all experienced delays in styles and sizes that limited their ability to fully meet strong demand, Old Navy was disproportionately impacted. We believe these supply chain disruption impacts to our sales and margins are transitory, although will persist in Q4 and potentially into early next year. With that, we've taken some near-term actions to proactively improve supply for holiday, and we're using the learnings from acute supply crisis to accelerate new capabilities for 2022 that we believe will help to better mitigate logistics challenges and more profitably increase speed to market going forward. 
Let me touch on some efforts. First, in the near term, we've secured incremental air capacity to support holiday inventory. In addition to an estimated $100 million of air costs incurred in Q3, we've also invested approximately $350 million in Q4 airfreight to further expedite holiday deliveries. And second, where possible, we have routed a modest portion of our inventory to East Coast ports to bypass the congestion in the L.A. Long Beach port. While we aspire to improve our on-time deliveries for holiday by adding air capacity and utilizing alternate ports, the supply chain situation continues to be volatile. Newly opened Vietnam factories are behind on holiday production ramping up slowly, ongoing port delays are worsening and air charters are causing new airport congestion. 
Our mitigation efforts are driving significant transitory costs, but we're focused on the long-term impact that delighting our customers with the products they love during the holiday season have and preserving market share and maintaining customer loyalty. 
We remain cautious in our outlook for the balance of the year and are updating our full-year 2021 EPS guidance range to $0.45 to $0.60 on a reported basis and $1.25 to $1.40 per share on an adjusted basis. We are updating our guidance solely based on the acute revenue and margin impacts from supply chain disruptions. This range now reflects the estimated lost sales from supply disruptions in the second half of 2021 to be $550 million to $650 million. In addition, our updated guidance range reflects approximately $450 million of transitory airfreight cost we have chosen to incur as we seek to meet as much customer demand as possible. And we are confident that when adjusting for these substantial disruptive impacts to 2021, our underlying business is ahead of plan, and we will emerge strong in 2022 and beyond. 
As we look to 2022, we are adding new capabilities that will enable us to navigate these disruptions with more flexibility and significantly less airfreight. Beginning with summer 2022, our teams have added the expected longer port delay times into product booking deadlines, which we believe will enable us to ship goods largely by ocean for on-time deliveries. In addition, Old Navy has now accelerated its use of digital product creation for the majority of its fall orders with vendors. This has added speed to the pipeline as the breakthrough and efficiency for the brand. 
Also to increase geographic diversification and flexibility, we expect to leverage more multinational vendors. And we will begin to deploy AI from our recent CD4 acquisition to better drive inventory in-stock in our stores. AI, combined with ongoing inventory management transformation efforts, and the leverage of our new loyalty program, gives us confidence in the sustainability of strong average unit retails in 2022. 
Now turning to third quarter financials. Before I get into specific results, I'd like to note that there are select charges we incurred in the quarter that are excluded from our adjusted financials, specifically costs related to restructuring our long-term debt and the transition of our European market to a partnership model. I'll provide more details on these as I talk through the results. 
Starting with sales. Net sales of $3.9 billion for the quarter were down 1% to 2019 with our Q3 sales deceleration from the first half of the year due to supply chain issues. Comp sales improved 5% on a 2-year basis. We're particularly pleased that 3 of our 4 brands delivered strong 2-year comp growth with Old Navy up 6%, Gap Global up 3% and North America up 13%, and Athleta up 41%, all while navigating acute supply issues. And while Banana Republic's 2-year comp was down 10%, the brand made progress in the quarter through its product and customer experience relaunch. Our strong e-commerce channel continues to be an advantage as online sales were up 48% compared to 2019, contributing 38% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% of total sales in Q3 2019. 
Moving to gross margin. Third quarter reported gross margin was 42.1%, an increase of 310 basis points versus 2019. Excluding impacts related to the transition of our European business to a partnership model, adjusted gross margin of 41.9% for the quarter represents the highest Q3 gross margin rate in over 10 years, expanding 290 basis points versus 2019 gross margin. This is primarily driven by 300 basis points in ROD leverage from higher online sales and lower rent occupancy and depreciation as a result of strategic foreclosures and renegotiated rents.
Merchandise margins were down just 10 basis points despite nearly 200 basis points of higher online shipping costs and about 250 basis points in short-term headwinds related to airfreight. Product acceptance was strong across all brands with our overall Q3 discount rate at the lowest level in 5 years. 
Turning to SG&A. Reported SG&A, which includes $26 million in charges related to the transition of our European operating model was 38.3% of sales, deleveraging 470 basis points compared to Q3 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 37.6% of sales, 610 basis points above 2019 adjusted SG&A. 
We continue to execute our strategy of driving down fixed costs while investing a portion of those costs into demand generation in the form of marketing and technology. Fixed costs have been significantly reduced as we successfully closed stores in North America, divested 2 brands earlier this year and reached partnership agreements for our European markets. 
Marketing, up 360 basis points versus 2019, supported the rollout of our new initiatives, particularly loyalty, inclusive sizing at Old Navy, and the brand relaunch at Banana Republic, and is a major contributor to our low discount rates. 
The balance of Q3 investments were primarily focused on technology to build out our digital and supply chain capabilities as well as on higher bonus accruals versus a low 2019 baseline as no meaningful incentive payouts were granted in that year based on performance. The investments we're making today are long-term differentiators, and we're committed to our strategy while remaining prudent even in the face of near-term supply headwinds. 
Regarding operating margin. Operating margin for the quarter was 3.9% on a reported basis. Excluding $17 million in charges related to our European market transition, adjusted operating margin was 4.3%, which as I noted earlier, includes the impact of an estimated $300 million in lost sales due to constrained inventory in addition to approximately $100 million in nonstructural airfreight costs. 
Moving on to interest and tax. During the quarter, we restructured our long-term debt by retiring all of our $2.25 billion senior secured notes and issuing $1.5 billion of lower coupon unsecured senior notes. Through this debt restructuring, we were able to reduce our overall debt balance, achieve material interest savings, approximately $140 million on an annual basis beginning in 2022, and unencumber our real estate assets previously pledged as collateral. 
We incurred a $325 million nonrecurring charge related to debt extinguishment in the quarter. Q3 net interest was $43 million. Full year net interest is now expected to be $163 million. Looking beyond 2021, we expect annual net interest expense of around $70 million. The effective tax rate was 29% for the third quarter, excluding the impact from fees related to debt extinguishment and the charge changes to our European operating model, the adjusted effective tax rate was 20%. We expect the full year effective tax rate to be about 23% on a reported basis and about 26% on an adjusted basis. 
Regarding earnings on the quarter, Q3 reported earnings reflect a loss of $0.40 per share. Excluding fees associated with our long-term debt restructuring and the transition of our European markets to a partnership model, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.27. 
Turning to inventory. Inventory delays worsened throughout the quarter, and our Q3 sales down 1% versus 2019 outpaced average on-hand inventory of down 11% to 2019. Third quarter inventory ended flat to 2019 and down 1% versus 2020, with average on-hand inventory down 7% and in-transit up 16% versus last year. 
On-hand inventory at the end of the quarter remained seasonally relevant with markdowns below Q3 fiscal '19 quarter end levels. We expect Q4 ending inventory to be up high single digits versus last year, although this point-in-time outlook may change given continued volatility in the supply chain. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended Q3 with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the quarter, we continued to return cash to shareholders, paying a Q3 dividend of $0.12 per share and repurchasing $73 million in shares as part of our current plan to offset dilution. And earlier this month, we announced a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share. 
Looking at our global store fleet, our plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic North America stores is expected to be approximately 75% complete by the end of the year. And with the recent announcement of our agreement to transition to a partner model in Italy, we've now concluded an important phase of the restructure of our European market. All markets are expected to be transferred to our new partners in early 2022. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our full year financial outlook, which we are downwardly revising solely based on the acute impact of sales and margin of the supply chain disruptions. Full year 2021 reported earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.60, which includes net charges of $445 million, comprised of $325 million in fees related to the restructuring of our long-term debt and approximately $120 million related to divestitures and the transition of our European business model to a -- European business to a partnership model. Excluding these charges and associated tax impacts, full year 2021 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.40.
This updated guidance now includes the following assumptions: first, we expect 2021 full year revenue growth of about 20% versus 2020. This range now reflects the expected lost sales from supply disruptions in the second half of 2021 of approximately $550 million to $650 million, including an estimated $300 million from Q3 and an estimated $250 million to $350 million in Q4. Second, we expect full year nonstructural air freight to be approximately $450 million. We consciously chose to air approximately 35% of our holiday product given the 2.5-month delays from Vietnam closures in Q3 and the over 3-week West Coast port delays so that we can give our customers as much holiday product as we can to deliver on their expectations. While this is material to our profitability, we believe it is necessary to further mitigate sales losses and retain customers for the long term. 
With the added air cost and the meaningful sales impact from supply constraints, we now expect full year 2021 reported operating margin to be about 4.5%, with adjusted operating margin at about 5% for fiscal 2021. This is inclusive of short-term air costs in the back half impacting operating margin by about 270 basis points. Full year capital spend is still expected to be approximately $800 million. 
In summary, when adjusting for the acute impact of supply chain disruptions, we are still expecting the year to end at or above our original plan for 2021, demonstrating that our underlying business trends are quite strong and providing real momentum. The progress we've made on our Power Plan 2023 strategy in the face of these challenges highlights the strength of our core business and the health of our brands, and we remain confident in our path as we move toward a 10% operating margin in 2023. 
With that, we'll open it up for Q&A."

So as we said on the call, we have amped up the airfreight for holiday in an effort to really navigate the lengthening port delays as well as the late opening of Vietnam. And there's a range of possible outcomes for how that could play through the holiday season. And so we'll see where that lands with holiday inventory. As it relates to the carryover into January and February, the teams have been really looking at -- for Vietnam, in particular, what units based on the closures do we need to cancel so that we didn't take them at all. What units can get reflowed into a future season. 
And then what units are we going to potentially pack and hold for next year. We proved this past year in the front half that pack and hold was a good strategy for us. And so if we think that things are going to be too late for the holiday season, we won't put them in stores or online and have them generate markdowns, instead we'll hold them for next year. So we're using a variety of things to help really navigate the current inventory situation so that we don't end up with a January or February inventory liability issue."

So as you know, we left the first half of this year with really strong momentum at Old Navy with 24% sales growth. And when we guided, we had baked in some disruption from Vietnam as we've seen in other countries, about 2- to 3-week closures as well as a 5-day port delay and because that is what we have seen, that's what we had forecasted, therefore, go forward. What actualized was, as you know, much more dramatic. We had a 2.5 month shutdown of Vietnam, which is our top sourcing country, and for Old Navy, the slightly higher, particularly for women. And so the compounding effect of that as well as the worsening port is the new news. And so as we thought about the health of Old Navy, the momentum, even in Q3, the growth in the Net Promoter Score and the growth and brand awareness through its BODEQUALITY launch, we made the decision to invest in airfreight in a substantial way to compete in holiday. So that's where we are right now. 
We think that the majority of the sales loss -- all the sales loss, in fact, is due to supply chain loss and Old Navy entered the quarter quite lean in inventory because of the strong demand in the first half, leaner than the portfolio. And then you exacerbate that with the out-of-stocks due to the supply constraints out of Vietnam and the port. And so that's really what we're navigating in the short term. We do believe it's transitory. We do believe that Old Navy is incredibly healthy, and has had, I think, all the indicators, the price realization, the brand health, the Net Promoter Score, the loyalty customers, the age of the customer with new customers joining that are younger, all of that abodes to the right bet to play offense for Old Navy."

When you look at our guidance for this year with a 5% operating margin, that includes about a 270 basis point impact from the transitory airfreight cost that we're incurring this year. And then in addition to that, it includes the close to $500 million of sales impact from supply constraints. And so all of that gives us confidence that this year, when you take out the supply chain impacts, would have been well ahead of our original Power Plan 2023 for this year and more in line with the guidance we provided back in August. So we're confident that we'll get through this. 
As we talked about before, we are looking forward, we're adding the supply chain delays from the ports to our buying timelines for summer. And then Old Navy is accelerating its move to digitizing product creation for fall, all of which we think will enable us to navigate next year with much less air freight, and we can see line of sight then to recovering the lost sales with better supply. So more to come when we get into next year, but we do see that this year would have been ahead of plan, and we have line of sight to mitigating these costs and sales losses going forward."

And we have a fair amount of rigor around marketing effectiveness and marketing spend that gave us confidence that it was the right level of investment. And as we look at Q3 for Old Navy, in particular, with Net Promoter Score being up, despite the fact that we have stock-outs, where we know we did -- we had some disappointment. And with the fact that the brand awareness is up 8 points for a brand of Old Navy size, that's really dramatic and strong based on BODEQUALITY, the BODEQUALITY launch. 
So we think the marketing investments are right. We're focused on fixed cost elimination that's automating our stores processes, that's removing unproductive sales to store closures and the transition of our unprofitable international markets. So those are areas that we've made a lot of progress on that affect broad SG&A as well as our store operations. Hopefully, that's gives a little bit more color on SG&A. We're very, very committed to digitizing our core operations so that our fixed SG&A costs in our 3-year plan continue to be a competitive advantage."

One, is that the right way to think about it? Is it onetime? Or is some of this going to stick? And then as we build to 10%, is this going to be kind of an even build over the next 24 months?

So you're thinking about that correctly. 
And then we'll give you more on how it will pace out 2022 versus 2023. But I think what Sonia and I would say is, by the end of this year, we're really proud that, I would say 75% of the core restructuring of the company is largely behind us. When you think about closing the North America stores, divesting of our 2 smaller brands, getting our 3 countries in Europe partnered, we do feel like -- we got the debt restructured in the third quarter, we do feel like we've made really good progress against the restructuring plan. And so the next 2 years really are going to be about driving now the optimization of that healthy core with these digitization efforts that we think will start to add value, as we talked about through inventory management, through lower return rates and through automation of some of our core processes to try and drive cost out. But we'll talk more about pacing when we get to the end of the year, but that's the way to think about that 10% operating margin."

And those who don't manufacture there, had a natural advantage. We continue to believe that the scale of our supply chain has always been an advantage right? It shows up in better rates, in better unit cost, and access to last mile. And so that's advantage. Now that said, we are using this as an opportunity to find ways to further insulate ourselves. And so while we expected the shutdown to be similar to other countries, a couple of weeks, for example, I think, the government delay was substantially longer in Vietnam, especially South Vietnam, where we were most exposed and in Old Navy women's where we were most exposed. So it was outside of our expectations. 
Going forward, we're focused on multinational vendors as opposed to single point partners as well as the digitizing of the product creation process, which will really let us reduce cycle times and lead times in our product-to-market model. So I think we're using this crisis as an opportunity as we did last year to accelerate some of the key components of our Power Plan 2023 including digitization, including supply chain transformation and inventory management transformation, which are all opportunities that we see leaning into, to move us forward."
