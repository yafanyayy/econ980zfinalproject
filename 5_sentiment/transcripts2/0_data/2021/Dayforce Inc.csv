246737890,701652400,2201010,"Ceridian HCM Holding Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Dayforce Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter. First, we had a st",471,"Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. 
Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter. First, we had a strong quarter. We delivered fourth quarter revenue results, which were above the high end of our guidance range. 
Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by more than 19% despite COVID-19 headwinds remaining elevated. Also, we delivered on our adjusted EBITDA guidance while accelerating the pace of our investments in product and technology and sales and marketing. Cloud recurring gross margin increased by 210 basis points to 70.9%, and excluding float revenue, expanded by 380 basis points. 
Second, on the sales side, we did see an impact from the second wave of COVID-19 in the form of elongated sales cycles for several large enterprise opportunities, which closed in January instead of December. While fourth quarter sales were below previous expectations, when factored together with January's closing of those transactions, sales performance was in line with last year, which was the strongest quarter in our history. Our sales pipeline is very strong. And we believe by the second half of 2021, our Dayforce recurring revenue growth rates, excluding float revenue, will return to pre-COVID-19 levels above 25%. 
Third, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the wallet strategy. We continued to see strong traction in adoption. More than 100 customers are using the wallet and over 375 have signed up in total. Attach rates on new sales have continued to be above 80%. In addition, data from our early adopters is proving our thesis that the wallet can have a positive impact on our customers' businesses. Wallet customers are seeing a 5% increase in recruiting close rates, a 9% reduction in the time it takes to fill an open position as compared to our broader group of customers. Additionally, [ 1/3 ] customers experienced 42% lower voluntary turnover among employees using the wallet. These metrics will continue to strengthen and validate the value proposition of the wallet, creating quantifiable value for our customers and their employees. 
Finally, we are very excited about the acquisition of Ascender. Ascender provides payroll for more than 1,200 customers, serving more than 1.3 million employees across APJ. Combined, we will serve over 1,500 customers and 2.5 million employees in the region. This positions us as the dominant contender in APJ, one of the fastest-growing regions and provides a significant cross-sell opportunity for Dayforce. We expect the acquisition to close in the second quarter, and we'll provide greater clarity to the financial implications of the acquisition at that time. 
I would like to now hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions. Thank you."

For example, if I look at Q4 that we just passed, we had expected to see about a $2 million recovery in terms of employment levels. So the impact from higher employment increasing our revenue by about $2 million. In reality, we only saw about $0.5 million recovery. And so it all depends really on what goes on at the employment levels as we move into the second half of 2021.

If we do look at it -- if I look at just Q4 alone relative to the prior Q4, the impact of employees and employment levels was about $9.5 million as compared to Q4 of 2019, and we had a float headwind of about $7 million compared to 2019. 
When we look at Q1, we go in again with headwinds from the employment side. I believe Jeremy, correct me, or Noemie correct me if I'm wrong, of about $6.5 million."

So if I look at the Ascender 1,200 customer base and employee base, the majority actually is in Australia. In Australia, they actually have 2 products. One of the product is in education and in government, which are new verticals for us in market. They have an exceptionally strong team when it comes to domain knowledge around payroll, which will help us significantly in the A&D space because, as you know, one of our constraints always for growth is just having great people around who can help implement and support our products. 
The plan for Ascender is no different than what we've spoken about historically that the technology stack is largely dated as compared to Dayforce. And so over a period of time, it provides a movement opportunity towards Dayforce. And as we do that, we would expect also to have the ability to upsell them on time and attendance, workforce management, talent acquisition, performance, comp, engagement and the like. So tremendous cross-sell ability. 
The other point about Ascender is when we combine it, as I mentioned, with Excelity, we do become the dominant player in the APJ region. And if I look at the APJ region, it's probably about 25% of the global TAM when you look at human capital management systems, and it's probably the fastest-growing regions as well. So it gives us a significant, if you like, presence inside the actual region. And already, we've seen impact of the Excelity acquisition in helping us win not only accounts in APJ, but other global accounts where both companies had significant headcount in the APJ region. So it fits very, very nicely. 
In terms of the future, we'll continue to look for opportunities in-country where we can find great people, customers that provide that opportunity to move to Dayforce and to upsell and to get the local knowledge, if you like, with inside the actual marketplace. So it's -- what I would say about Ascender, it's very much in line with what we communicated to the market well over a year ago."

What I mean by that is that we didn't have the same urgency that we typically have at end of year where it's all hands on deck from the customer to get the contract signed. So even though we were at black lines with the actual customers, getting that final signature was a little bit more effort than we've seen beforehand. So shortly after New Year, those transactions close, we're talking about a handful of customers, 3 or 4 large transactions that moved over into the January. 
In terms of COVID, we didn't see the recovery that we had expected in Q4. And as I mentioned, we had thought that the headwinds in terms of employment numbers would improve between $1 million to $2 million in Q4. In reality, we only saw about $0.5 million of recovery. And so we are still seeing impact of COVID, if you like, in Q1 in terms of employment counts. We do believe, though, by the second half of the year, we should be through that. 
In the U.S., already, I would say, it looks like -- and we've seen the numbers being published that the employment numbers in the U.S. seem to be going up.

Now if I go back a year ago, when we spoke about add-ons, we typically were speaking about additional modules that we're adding to the customer. Now we're also seeing the impact of global. So last year, the add-ons were about 20%. If I look at Q4, we were at 25%, and I would say that probably is the impact of the global employee populations that we're actually adding on to Dayforce. 
The other point that I've mentioned that if I look at the actual growth in terms of employment accounts, we obviously are up about 9%, I believe, in terms of the average size in Q4. But remember, that is after taking into account the employment headwinds that we typically wouldn't have had and the float headwind. So if you actually corrected from that, I think it actually would have been even more significant.

As I mentioned, we've seen about an 80% attachment rate of wallet to new customers. The metrics that we now also have, if I look at -- remember, when we build a module, we've used the same methodology from a very onset, which is what are the KPIs we can impact at the customer through use of the actual module and how does an improvement in that KPI translates into dollar or money benefit for the customer. And so when I look at the actual wallet metrics that we're now able to look at, and we get that by looking at wallet users versus the general population of our customers, and we obviously have almost 5,000 customers now. So we have a big group we did a test in. 
We're seeing the benefit on the talent acquisition side and on retention side. And just the retention side alone, I mean, if you actually run through the numbers, you get a 42% reduction in voluntary turnover. And if you just make the math easy, you say, okay, a person makes $50,000. We're looking at typically a 10% voluntary attrition rate at a company. If they have 1,000 employees, that means that they typically would lose about 100 people per year. If we can impact that by reducing that by 40%, that means that we can save them 40 people. The cost of replacing each of those people is probably 25% of their salary. So 12.5 $1,000 per person, times 40 people, right? And that's obviously a big number. That's about 100,000 just from the use of the wallet in that particular customer. 
So you're beginning to see the ROI. And again, it ties back to the whole premise we have to create quantifiable value for our customers. Now with wallet, we extend that onto the employee side as well. Because when an employee actually begins to use a wallet, they get access to their funds continually. So if you have a credit card bill that comes due in the middle of the month between pay periods, this allows you to pay off your credit card as opposed to doing the minimum payment paying the interest of 22% on the full balance. And also, if you are someone who is really a non-bank employee or you paycheck to paycheck, it allows you to avoid those very extensive fees of going to payday loan or to actually other types of extensive types of borrowing. 
And when we look at the way that we built the wallet, it leverages that continuous pay engine that we have with inside Dayforce. Remember, as we compare to any other competitor in market, with us, we have one system with one rule engine, so that's continually throughout the pay period, we calculate your net earnings. The wallet allows the employee to see how much they've made net of other deductions and taxes added to the Dayforce wallet, go off and spend it. We don't charge the customer anything for the use of the wallet. We don't have them change the way that they fund their payroll. They still fund at the end of the actual payroll cycle. We don't charge the employee any direct fees or the usage of the actual wallet to load money onto the actual wallet or to actually do the spend. So again, we're creating tremendous value for the employees of our customers as well as for the customer base. And that is a big differentiation relative to anyone else in the market."

Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. 
Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter. First, we had a strong quarter. We delivered fourth quarter revenue results, which were above the high end of our guidance range. 
Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by more than 19% despite COVID-19 headwinds remaining elevated. Also, we delivered on our adjusted EBITDA guidance while accelerating the pace of our investments in product and technology and sales and marketing. Cloud recurring gross margin increased by 210 basis points to 70.9%, and excluding float revenue, expanded by 380 basis points. 
Second, on the sales side, we did see an impact from the second wave of COVID-19 in the form of elongated sales cycles for several large enterprise opportunities, which closed in January instead of December. While fourth quarter sales were below previous expectations, when factored together with January's closing of those transactions, sales performance was in line with last year, which was the strongest quarter in our history. Our sales pipeline is very strong. And we believe by the second half of 2021, our Dayforce recurring revenue growth rates, excluding float revenue, will return to pre-COVID-19 levels above 25%. 
Third, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the wallet strategy. We continued to see strong traction in adoption. More than 100 customers are using the wallet and over 375 have signed up in total. Attach rates on new sales have continued to be above 80%. In addition, data from our early adopters is proving our thesis that the wallet can have a positive impact on our customers' businesses. Wallet customers are seeing a 5% increase in recruiting close rates, a 9% reduction in the time it takes to fill an open position as compared to our broader group of customers. Additionally, wallet customers experienced 42% lower voluntary turnover among employees using the wallet. These metrics will continue to strengthen and validate the value proposition of the wallet, creating quantifiable value for our customers and their employees. 
Finally, we are very excited about the acquisition of Ascender. Ascender provides payroll for more than 1,200 customers, serving more than 1.3 million employees across APJ. Combined, we will serve over 1,500 customers and 2.5 million employees in the region. This positions us as the dominant contender in APJ, one of the fastest-growing regions and provides a significant cross-sell opportunity for Dayforce. We expect the acquisition to close in the second quarter, and we'll provide greater clarity to the financial implications of the acquisition at that time. 
I would like to now hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions. Thank you."

One other point about Ascender is when you combine Ascender with Excelity, we're at about 1,500 customers, about 2.5 million employees paid, and we believe that positions us as the dominant leader in the APJ region, which is the fastest-growing region for human capital management.

So if I look at the Ascender 1,200 customer base and employee base, the majority actually is in Australia. In Australia, they actually have 2 products. One of the product is in education and in government, which are new verticals for us in market. They have an exceptionally strong team when it comes to domain knowledge around payroll, which will help us significantly in the A&D space because, as you know, one of our constraints always for growth is just having great people around who can help implement and support our products. 
The plan for Ascender is no different than what we've spoken about historically that the technology stack is largely dated as compared to Dayforce. And so over a period of time, it provides a movement opportunity towards Dayforce. And as we do that, we would expect also to have the ability to upsell them on time and attendance, workforce management, talent acquisition, performance, comp, engagement and the like. So tremendous cross-sell ability. 
The other point about Ascender is when we combine it, as I mentioned, with Excelity, we do become the dominant player in the APJ region. And if I look at the APJ region, it's probably about 25% of the global TAM when you look at human capital management systems, and it's probably the fastest-growing regions as well. So it gives us a significant, if you like, presence inside the actual region. And already, we've seen impact of the Excelity acquisition in helping us win not only accounts in APJ, but other global accounts where both companies had significant headcount in the APJ region. So it fits very, very nicely. 
In terms of the future, we'll continue to look for opportunities in-country where we can find great people, customers that provide that opportunity to move to Dayforce and to upsell and to get the local knowledge, if you like, with inside the actual marketplace.

What I mean by that is that we didn't have the same urgency that we typically have at end of year where it's all hands on deck from the customer to get the contract signed. So even though we were at black lines with the actual customers, getting that final signature was a little bit more effort than we've seen beforehand. So shortly after New Year, those transactions close, we're talking about a handful of customers, 3 or 4 large transactions that moved over into the January. 
In terms of COVID, we didn't see the recovery that we had expected in Q4. And as I mentioned, we had thought that the headwinds in terms of employment numbers would improve between $1 million to $2 million in Q4. In reality, we only saw about $0.5 million of recovery. And so we are still seeing impact of COVID, if you like, in Q1 in terms of employment counts. We do believe, though, by the second half of the year, we should be through that. 
In the U.S., already, I would say, it looks like -- and we've seen the numbers being published that the employment numbers in the U.S. seem to be going up. Canada, though, it's a little bit behind because I think you know the vaccine rollout in Canada hasn't been as successful as it is in the U.S."

Now if I go back a year ago, when we spoke about add-ons, we typically were speaking about additional modules that we're adding to the customer. Now we're also seeing the impact of global. So last year, the add-ons were about 20%. If I look at Q4, we were at 25%, and I would say that probably is the impact of the global employee populations that we're actually adding on to Dayforce. 
The other point that I've mentioned that if I look at the actual growth in terms of employment accounts, we obviously are up about 9%, I believe, in terms of the average size in Q4. But remember, that is after taking into account the employment headwinds that we typically wouldn't have had and the float headwind. So if you actually corrected from that, I think it actually would have been even more significant.

As I mentioned, we've seen about an 80% attachment rate of wallet to new customers. The metrics that we now also have, if I look at -- remember, when we build a module, we've used the same methodology from a very onset, which is what are the KPIs we can impact at the customer through use of the actual module and how does an improvement in that KPI translates into dollar or money benefit for the customer. And so when I look at the actual wallet metrics that we're now able to look at, and we get that by looking at wallet users versus the general population of our customers, and we obviously have almost 5,000 customers now. So we have a big group we did a test in. 
We're seeing the benefit on the talent acquisition side and on retention side. And just the retention side alone, I mean, if you actually run through the numbers, you get a 42% reduction in voluntary turnover. And if you just make the math easy, you say, okay, a person makes $50,000. We're looking at typically a 10% voluntary attrition rate at a company. If they have 1,000 employees, that means that they typically would lose about 100 people per year. If we can impact that by reducing that by 40%, that means that we can save them 40 people. The cost of replacing each of those people is probably 25% of their salary. So 12.5 $1,000 per person, times 40 people, right? And that's obviously a big number. That's about 100,000 just from the use of the wallet in that particular customer. 
So you're beginning to see the ROI. And again, it ties back to the whole premise we have to create quantifiable value for our customers. Now with wallet, we extend that onto the employee side as well. Because when an employee actually begins to use a wallet, they get access to their funds continually. So if you have a credit card bill that comes due in the middle of the month between pay periods, this allows you to pay off your credit card as opposed to doing the minimum payment paying the interest of 22% on the full balance. And also, if you are someone who is really a non-bank employee or you paycheck to paycheck, it allows you to avoid those very extensive fees of going to payday loan or to actually other types of extensive types of borrowing. 
And when we look at the way that we built the wallet, it leverages that continuous pay engine that we have with inside Dayforce. Remember, as we compare to any other competitor in market, with us, we have one system with one rule engine, so that's continually throughout the pay period, we calculate your net earnings. The wallet allows the employee to see how much they've made net of other deductions and taxes added to the Dayforce wallet, go off and spend it. We don't charge the customer anything for the use of the wallet. We don't have them change the way that they fund their payroll. They still fund at the end of the actual payroll cycle. We don't charge the employee any direct fees or the usage of the actual wallet to load money onto the actual wallet or to actually do the spend. So again, we're creating tremendous value for the employees of our customers as well as for the customer base. And that is a big differentiation relative to anyone else in the market."

So if I look at UKI, we built out native payroll for first the U.K. and then we extended into Ireland. And we've been very successful there, but we started with a little bit more momentum given the history that we had inside the country beforehand. 
In Australia, we started off by building native, time and payroll for the ANZ market. We've entered an acquisition of RITEQ, which largely was to get people who understood the workforce management side to allow us to continue doing implementations inside the region. 
Excelity and Ascender slightly different because we were expanding our scope outside of ANZ into the broader APJ type of region. And particularly with Ascender, we're picking up a wonderful team of really experienced people in the ANZ marketplace that we do believe will further differentiated but also allow us to continue to grow inside that region. 
When we look more broadly on the global market, you'll continue to see that we're building out major pay for Germany. That doesn't mean that we weren't, looking for some of the types of assets around that particular type of region. We still have to ourself looking towards Latin America and other parts of Europe. The world is a big place. So there are lots and lots of opportunities out there. And I do believe that the Dayforce global strategy from a technology platform perspective is very differentiated with the other players in market."

Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on the key points from the quarter. 
First from, we had strong financial performance in the first quarter. That was meaningful guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 21%. First quarter sales were significantly above 2019 and 2020, and we expect sales momentum to continue reflecting a strong sales pipeline and pent-up demand. 
Second, we are excited to say that we expect total revenue in 2021 to exceed $1 billion. A significant milestone for Ceridian. Looking forward to the rest of the year. In the second quarter of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float to grow 28% to 29% year-over-year. 
And for the second half of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow above 29% compared to the second half of 2020. 
Finally, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the Wallet strategy. We continue to see traction in registration, and we are seeing registration rates now of over 20%. We have more than 150 customers using the Wallet and over 450 have signed up in total. 
Attach rates on new sales have continued to be approximately 80%. In April, we launched Dayforce Wallet in Canada and already have more than 40 customers signed up. Throughout 2021, we'll continue to introduce new features in Dayforce Wallet to increase employee adoption and to drive Dayforce sale. 
In summary, we believe we are extremely well positioned to capture market share, extend our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.

And in customers that have been using the product the longest, we are seeing it almost at 30%, if not higher in some cases. 
In terms of the usage pattern, the typical active user uses a product about half a dozen times per month, typically loading on about $120 per time. So we're seeing quite high usage of it. In terms of the features that we are adding to the product, there will be 2 additional feature rollouts this year. 
One in June and 1 in the second half. In June, it we're adding features for a virtual card. So you don't need to have the plastic present to do a transaction. We're adding direct deposit capability, which means I, as an employee, will be able to just with a single click, say I'd like to stream my payroll to my Wallet at the end of every day. 
Currently, the user has to go to the Wallet up, say, hey, I'd like to add $100 to my Wallet. This will be completely fluid without the user having to do that. Obviously, with guardrails for the user, how much they would like to add or what they're going to be balances and such. 
We're adding additional pay card capability, which, as you know, makes it a viable for miners to use the product as well. And then we're adding some notification capabilities to the actual product as well. So nudges and such. 
In the second half of the year, we expect to launch savings for the Wallet balance. We'll have various types of referral programs. We'll be launching our reward programs, more in-app self-service, change of PIN, things like that, enhance notifications, and will we start to move into areas of financial wellness. 
So we have quite a robust road map for the actual Wallet. And as we mentioned, all of these features, we believe will add to more adoption of the Wallet, higher usage, but also will help us in the Dayforce sales side as well."

We do sell in North America and EMEA, payroll, payroll and workforce management, without the HCM components. We've done that at many of the very large customers. And in that case, often, the ERP is a system of record, and they're bringing best-of-breed for some of the talent components. 
I believe the same pattern will be in APJ as well. Now there is an upsell for customers that I'll say are in the major market segment to the small enterprise segment. And in those cases, we do believe there is a strong upsell possibility for workforce management, core HR and all the talent modules we have as well. 
In terms of the strategy, we spoke a bit about it in the shareholder letter. Over a 4 to 5-year period, we expect to migrate the accounts over to Dayforce. The Ascender acquisition brings with it several different products. There are 2 products in Australia. One is a major market product, 1 is multiple government, education and larger enterprises. 
On the major market product, we are already beginning our migrations. In the enterprise, education and government sector, we have to add some capabilities to the Dayforce application. Now in the rest of Asia, with the exception of Japan, we have been building alongside the R&D team of Excelity, a Dayforce payroll factory for most of the countries across Asia. 
And we believe to have that online relatively soon, which will give us native capability for Dayforce across all of those geographies, and we'll be able to start the migration. And then in Japan, there is a separate product that Ascender has in Japan. We intend to keep that product given the uniqueness of that particular market."

And we have examples now, successful examples of where we have signed new contracts with SIs priming, the Dayforce implementation. 
You'll see that reflected in some of the professional services numbers. So you'll see less professional services growth year-over-year as some of the SIs are now doing the implementations. And you'll see that in the way that we reflect some of the numbers. For example, the Dayforce incremental revenue and such, we'll now start to focus on recurring revenue because we expect the SIs to begin priming on that particular side. 
But in terms of number, in terms of depth of relationship, in terms of success in having the SIs prime and also success in the SI is bringing us. Some very, very nice deals.

In terms of the actual wins, it's hard to say a favorite. I don't think you're allowed to say that. All of our customers are our favorites. But there are some that I really do think that are great. If you look at the size of some of them, we called out 1 in particular in the shareholder letter, where we talk about a large kind of health care organization. 
I was quite involved with them as well. It is quite a competitive deal against the regular competitors and some of the ERPs that you'll suspect to be playing.

So there's a fewer Ks that you have to do. And then you get your plastic in the mail just a few days later. 
In fact, when we launched in Canada, I was 1 of the first users to use the app, and it is really easy to use. So we don't get any pushback from the customers in that this is too difficult to do. From a payroll administration piece as well, it doesn't complicate the process. There's no reconciliation that the payroll team has to do. They don't have to change the way that they do the funding. 
It's not a bolt ARM system. It's just embedded with inside the application. We've had tremendous feedback from the customers that are using the Wallet in terms of ease of use benefit to their employees. And we've got a whole bunch of case studies where employees have written to us talking about the benefit from a financial well-being perspective. 
So we remain very, very confident. I believe the direct deposit and the streaming or pay feature that will launch in the June release is going to be very, very well accepted."

So Matt, look, I think there's been a benefit to demand across the pandemic. And it's gone in phases. In the first phase, I think a lot of the companies who are still relying on paper forms, paper manual processes or had on-prem systems. We're in a mad rush to get into the cloud and to digitize all of the interactions with their employees. 
And that has continued to drive demand. What we're finding now is that when I call out and I speak to customers, and I speak to probably about 20 customers per week. What I'm finding across the C-level is that there is a real concern that with people having been working at home for over a year that is becoming more difficult to maintain the culture and the bonding at an organization. And so a lot of organizations are looking for products like us that can really help communicate and bring employees together so that you can maintain and strengthen culture and obviously keep engagement levels very high. 
In the shareholder letter, I spoke about how we -- or how I've been describing how we've used the application. Firstly, we used the hub that we recently launched. And we did that because we revised our values. We removed 1 added to, and so we use that as a way of communicating the new values to our employee group with embedded training on all the different values, embedded videos and such. 
Second, we've been using the DEI dashboard from an ESG perspective, and that's been very, very helpful for me to actually see trends and to make sure we're moving in the right direction to make sure that we have proper diversity and balance inside our executive team, and it's gone very, very nicely. 
We've been using the engagement features to keep a score on track on what our E&PS levels have been making sure that we're addressing important items for the employees. And lastly, the Dayforce Wallet really has given our employees much better financial flexibility and wellness. And those are the things that people are looking for because when you bring it together, that keeps the company together. And in times like this is very important.

When it comes to M&A strategy, as you know, we are focused on the regional consolidation play. And I've spoken about that before. There are many companies out there that are in particular jurisdictions that have legacy technology, typically focus only on the payroll side, great opportunity for us to acquire a nice multiple use the knowledge, their people, their operations to really build out that capability quickly inside the Dayforce and then over time, look at migrating their customers onto the Dayforce platform, and we get tremendous benefit elsewhere in the world by having that capability in that particular region. 
We spoke about that on the last shareholder letter, how we were seeing pickup in global sales because of our APJ capability, and that's continued. 
We are looking at other regions around the world now. And I would expect that we'll do some transactions like that over the next couple of years. The other area of M&A where we've been quite active, and you see this with the ideal acquisition, which I've got to say is really a great piece of software. 
The team is exceptionally strong. We're talking about a big group of data scientists with very deep knowledge in terms of talent and talent acquisition. We had been partnering with them on the Dayforce side for over a 2- year period. It already had embedded inside the product. So we knew what the product could actually do. 
But we are looking for acquisitions like that as well, where you acquire a specific type of capability that allows us to leverage that capability inside the Dayforce product to get more of an advantage relative to our competitors. Another example where you saw that was on the benefit side, we acquired them several years ago. That gave us a benefit decision support, the benefit intelligence piece, also, which has gone really, really nicely in market. 
So yes, I do think M&A of those 2 different flavors will be a part of our picture."

And as well, the merchant pays the network fee for the actual purchase, and we will probably get at what we do. We get a split of that with the actual partner. 
We'll probably also have partnerships for Bill Pay and as well for kind of -- kind of Click Switch that you go to Amazon on Netflix making it very, very easy with a simple click to use the interim. Your Dayforce card as a source of payment. So I would expect to get that. 
In terms of where the people can keep their money is, we'll start off with savings, the interest based savings accounts where the cardholder can select, which bank they would like the money to be held out and the interest that they'd like to get on that. And then over time, we'll get into more financial wellness types of products as well."

So stepping back, if I think about the kind of growth execution that you're looking to put up, you've given guidance, is there -- a lot of things have kind of fallen into place. Not to mention, you've also hired another rock star Head of Sales.

We go back to the base. We sell them additional modules. I spoke about the 28% add-ons that we're now seeing. Third, we move up into the enterprise space. And you've seen that if you read through the shareholder letter, you'll see some great examples of some very large organizations. 
Four, we move on a global basis. And I think our execution in UKI has been wonderful. If I look at the deals that we're signing in the EMEA region. They already are tremendous, and we're only 2 years out to gate that. The moves that we're making now in APJ obviously support that as well. And I expect we'll make similar types of moves elsewhere in the world. 
And so that's going very, very nicely. And then we've always spoken about adjacent products like the Wallet, which allows us to drive more recurring revenue from the people who use our systems. Now in order to do that, we have to obviously invest quite heavily in talent. If you look at the people that we brought on, people like Noemie, people like Rocky people, like Lee, people like Joe, all of the individuals that we brought in have experience at scale, and they have experience on a global basis. And that gives us the confidence that we can execute against those 5 different growth levers, and I think we have. 
I'm also very proud of how resilient Ceridian was over the time of the pandemic. We spoke about leaning into the pandemic and coming out even stronger, and I think that is the case."

Without a doubt, having the wallet has helped our win rate, and there probably are 2 reasons for that. The first is, we always speak about that we're differentiated in market in that we have a continuous calc engine, which means that when you change a timesheet an HR record, a benefit record, we immediately calculate the net earnings. 
The Wallet leverages that capability. And so when we talk about being able to offer the Wallet, it also clearly explains to the customer the advantage of having a continuous calc engine, which the others don't have. 
And so I do think it has helped us tremendously. Second, when we speak to the HR team and we speak about talent, and about how we can improve the engagement, deliver, benefit and also improve their ability to attract new people to the organization. We have some tremendous stats coming from the Wallet, and we spoke about them last time. That we found that when we look at active cardholders versus non active cardholders in the same companies, the voluntary attrition rate goes down by 42%. 
And when we talk about the speed of fill in, an open job vacancy, we see that improving by about 10%. And those are really, really great numbers. In terms of industries, I can actually just look at it right here, look at it kind of live for you. And so if I look at my kind of industry dashbord they have, we're seeing con of success right across industries with peak at the moment in retail, professional services, manufacturing, financial services and construction."

So there are a few things with us. There's a lot of focus now on employee communications.

So there are a few things with us. There's a lot of focus now on employee communications. We launched the Dayforce Hub recently and what that is, it's effectively a homepage that a customer can tailor based on jurisdiction, type of employee, I think put their branding on it, they can make a look until I really meet their own personality. 
You can have deep linking inside our application or deep linking to external applications as well. You can have time-sensitive content and action items for their people. And that's obviously to be a central communication hub, which is very powerful. 
As I mentioned, we used them internally to relaunch our values and as very successfully. Second, on the recruiting side, we're obviously seeing a lot on talent acquisition. Now on the talent acquisition, we just acquired ideal. And what I do really has is that they have AI that is used for grading of the candidates to apply. And it's a true machine learning algorithm, which means that if the hiring manager of a recruiter doesn't agree with the grade. They can correct in the system learns based on behavior. 
They also have great capability from a DI perspective. So when you're actually going through the candidates you're making sure that you don't have any type of bias across the hiring managers, and we believe we can use that capability as well in areas like performance management and the like. 
We're very, very strong on employee onboarding. And when I talk about employee onboarding, the single application becomes very powerful because you normally start off with a landing page. We have a message from the CEO, a multimedia. You then go into the sign-offs and instead of just saying, ""Hey, have you read the code, the company ethics or behavior or privacy, you now embed learning directly into that experience. 
You take the course and then it signs you off you have the various chapters, the various forms that can now be completed digitally, which obviously help tremendously. We then typically bring in benefit enrollment. So we go through the benefit decision support to make it already pleasing experience. You typically bring in a bit more learning management. So you have on the job training, set up the persons, a 30 day, 60 day, 90-day development plans and the like. 
And so it's very -- it works very, very nicely. Now the same onboarding modules use what we call transporting. So you can think about people returning to work and putting together a proper experience when people will be coming back to offices that don't look the same that they were before the COVID pandemic. 
So obviously, a big uptick in that as well. We also are doing quite nicely on areas like engagement. As I mentioned before, it's a top concern for any CEO, making to that engagement levels are holding while people are at home, ability to do poll surveys for engagement surveys, leveraging again a lot of intelligence features like sentiment analysis to read through the comments so that you can make sure that any comments that aren't positive or delta correctly. 
So obviously, quite a lot. Also what is another area is on the global side. In today's work from home, using tools like Zoom and such, where someone sits is no longer as important as it was prior to the pandemic. And so the ability to have global payroll capability, be able to do things like compensation management, either in a constant currency or local currency, from a budgeting perspective, it becomes very, very important, but also to handle how do you pay people they're in Brazil or they're in Portugal or if they're in the U.S., Canada, in a single system, all of those seem to be driving the add ons."

Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on the key points from the quarter.
First, we had strong financial performance in the first quarter. That was meaningful guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 21%. First quarter sales were significantly above 2019 and 2020, and we expect sales momentum to continue reflecting a strong sales pipeline and pent-up demand. Second, we are excited to say that we expect total revenue in 2021 to exceed $1 billion, a significant milestone for Ceridian.
Looking forward to the rest of the year, in the second quarter of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float to grow 28% to 29% year-over-year. And for the second half of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow above 29% compared to the second half of 2020.
Finally, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the Wallet strategy. We continue to see traction in registration, and we are seeing registration rates now of over 20%. We have more than 150 customers using the Wallet, and over 450 have signed up in total.
Attach rates on new sales have continued to be approximately 80%. In April, we launched Dayforce Wallet in Canada and already have more than 40 customers signed up. Throughout 2021, we'll continue to introduce new features into Dayforce Wallet to increase employee adoption and to drive Dayforce sale.
In summary, we believe we are extremely well positioned to capture market share, extend our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.
I would like to now hand it back to Jeremy to open up the call for questions."

And in customers that have been using the product the longest, we are seeing it almost at 30%, if not higher in some cases.
In terms of the usage pattern, the typical active user uses a product about half a dozen times per month, typically loading on about $120 per time. So we're seeing quite high usage of it.
In terms of the features that we are adding to the product, there will be 2 additional feature rollouts this year, one in June and one in the second half. In June, we're adding features for a virtual card. So you don't need to have the plastic present to do a transaction. We're adding direct deposit capability, which means I, as an employee, will be able to just with a single click say I'd like to stream my payroll to my Wallet at the end of every day. Currently, the user has to go to the Wallet app, say, hey, I'd like to add $100 to my Wallet. This will be completely fluid without the user having to do that. Obviously, with guardrails for the user, how much they would like to add or what they're going to be balances and such.
We're adding additional pay card capability, which, as you know, makes it viable for minors to use the product as well. And then we're adding some notification capabilities to the actual product as well, so nudges and such.
In the second half of the year, we expect to launch savings for the Wallet balance. We'll have various types of referral programs. We'll be launching our reward programs, more in-app self-service, change of PIN, things like that, enhanced notifications, and will we start to move into areas of financial wellness.
So we have quite a robust road map for the actual Wallet. And as we mentioned, all of these features, we believe, will add to more adoption of the Wallet, higher usage, but also will help us in the Dayforce sales side as well."

Now there is an upsell for customers that I'll say are in the major market segment to the small enterprise segment. And in those cases, we do believe there is a strong upsell possibility for workforce management, core HR and all the talent modules we have as well. 
In terms of the strategy, we spoke a bit about it in the shareholder letter. Over a 4- to 5-year period, we expect to migrate the accounts over to Dayforce. The Ascender acquisition brings with it several different products. There are 2 products in Australia. One is a major market product, one is more for government, education and larger enterprises.
On the major market product, we are already beginning our migrations. In the enterprise, education and government sector, we have to add some capabilities to the Dayforce application. Now in the rest of Asia, with the exception of Japan, we have been building, alongside the R&D team of Excelity, a Dayforce payroll factory for most of the countries across Asia. And we believe to have that online relatively soon, which will give us native capability for Dayforce across all of those geographies, and we'll be able to start the migration.
And then in Japan, there is a separate product that Ascender has in Japan. We intend to keep that product given the uniqueness of that particular market."

And you'll see that in the way that we reflect some of the numbers. For example, the Dayforce incremental revenue and such, we'll now start to focus on recurring revenue because we expect the SIs to begin priming on that particular side.
But in terms of number, in terms of depth of relationship, in terms of success in having the SIs prime and also success in the SIs bringing us some very, very nice deals.

In terms of the actual wins, it's hard to say a favorite. I don't think you're allowed to say that. All of our customers are our favorites. But there are some that I really do think that are great. If you look at the size of some of them, we called out one in particular in the shareholder letter, where we talked about a large kind of health care organization. I was quite involved with them as well. It is quite a competitive deal against the regular competitors and some of the ERPs that you'll suspect to be playing.

In fact, when we launched in Canada, I was one of the first users to use the app, and it is really easy to use. So we don't get any pushback from the customers in that this is too difficult to do. From a payroll administration piece as well, it doesn't complicate the process. There's no reconciliation that the payroll team has to do. They don't have to change the way that they do the funding.
It's not a bolt-on system. It's just embedded with inside the application. We've had tremendous feedback from the customers that are using the Wallet in terms of ease-of-use benefit to their employees. And we've got a whole bunch of case studies where employees have written to us talking about the benefit from a financial well-being perspective.
So we remain very, very confident. I believe the direct deposit and the streaming of pay feature that will launch in the June release is going to be very, very well accepted."

So that's why you're going to see translating into higher product and technology spend as a percentage of revenue as well as a higher cash spent on R&D, which is something we're doing consciously in order to gain some market share.
And we're seeing also some increased spend in sales and marketing as we are expanding our capabilities with large enterprise customer sellers, we're building the SI partnerships and so on. So that translates into a higher sales and marketing that we are also -- you're going to see also throughout the year.

So Matt, look, I think there's been a benefit to demand across the pandemic. And it's gone in phases. In the first phase, I think a lot of the companies who are still relying on paper forms, paper manual processes or had on-prem systems were in a mad rush to get into the cloud and to digitize all of the interactions with their employees. And that has continued to drive demand.
What we're finding now is that when I call out -- and I speak to customers, and I speak to probably about 20 customers per week. What I'm finding across the C-level is that there is a real concern that with people having been working at home for over a year, that is becoming more difficult to maintain the culture and the bonding at an organization. And so a lot of organizations are looking for products like us that can really help communicate and bring employees together so that you can maintain and strengthen culture and obviously keep engagement levels very high.
In the shareholder letter, I spoke about how we -- or how I've been describing how we've used the application. Firstly, we used the hub that we recently launched. And we did that because we revised our values. We removed 1, added 2, and so we used that as a way of communicating the new values to our employee group with embedded training on all the different values, embedded videos and such.
Second, we've been using the DEI dashboard from an ESG perspective, and that's been very, very helpful for me to actually see trends and to make sure we're moving in the right direction to make sure that we have proper diversity and balance inside our executive team, and it's gone very, very nicely. We've been using the engagement features to keep a score on track on what our E&PS levels have been, making sure that we're addressing important items for the employees.
And lastly, the Dayforce Wallet really has given our employees much better financial flexibility and wellness. And those are the things that people are looking for because when you bring it together, that keeps the company together and in times like this is very important. And I believe those are the reasons that we've seen such a strong demand for our product."

I think we've built it, strengthened, and we've been able to execute on a number of transactions. And I already gave kudos to our M&A team headed up by, as you know, Erik Zimmer. He's done a really, really great job.
When it comes to M&A strategy, as you know, we are focused on the regional consolidation play. And I've spoken about that before. There are many companies out there that are in particular jurisdictions that have legacy technology, typically focused only on the payroll side, great opportunity for us to acquire a nice multiple, use the knowledge, their people, their operations to really build out that capability quickly inside Dayforce and then, over time, look at migrating their customers onto the Dayforce platform, and we get tremendous benefit elsewhere in the world by having that capability in that particular region.
We spoke about that on the last shareholder letter, how we were seeing pickup in global sales because of our APJ capability, and that's continued. We are looking at other regions around the world now. And I would expect that we'll do some transactions like that over the next couple of years.
The other area of M&A where we've been quite active, and you see this with the Ideal acquisition, which I've got to say is really a great piece of software. The team is exceptionally strong. We're talking about a big group of data scientists with very deep knowledge in terms of talent and talent acquisition. We had been partnering with them on the Dayforce side for over a 2-year period, already had embedded inside the product. So we knew what the product could actually do.
But we are looking for acquisitions like that as well, where you acquire a specific type of capability that allows us to leverage that capability inside the Dayforce product to get more of an advantage relative to our competitors. Another example where you saw that was on the benefits side, Clearview Logix. We acquired them several years ago. That gave us a benefit decision support, the benefit intelligence piece, also which has gone really, really nicely in market. So yes, I do think M&A of those 2 different flavors will be a part of our future."

So when we talk about rewards, so we'll do the rewards through one of the -- obviously, the programs out there. There are probably 2 big players in the U.S. With that, there is a revenue share.

We'll probably also have partnerships for bill pay and as well for kind of click switch that you go to Amazon or Netflix making it very, very easy with a simple click to use the -- in the interim, your Dayforce card as a source of payment. So I would expect to get that.
In terms of where the people can keep their money is, we'll start off with savings, the interest-based savings accounts where the cardholder can select which bank they would like the money to be held at and the interest that they'd like to get on that.

And so when we talk about being able to offer the Wallet, it also clearly explains to the customer the advantage of having a continuous calc engine, which the others don't have. And so I do think it has helped us tremendously.
Second, when we speak to the HR team and we speak about talent and about how we can improve the engagement, deliver benefit and also improve their ability to attract new people into the organization, we have some tremendous stats coming from the Wallet. And we spoke about them last time, that we found that when we look at active cardholders versus nonactive cardholders in the same companies, the voluntary attrition rate goes down by 42%. And when we talk about the speed of fill in an open job vacancy, we see that improving by about 10%. And those are really, really great numbers.
In terms of industries, I can actually just look at it right here, look at it kind of live for you. And so if I look at my kind of industry dashboard they have, we're seeing kind of success right across industries, with peak at the moment in retail, professional services, manufacturing, financial services and construction."

We have the single database, the single-rule engine, we have the Dayforce Wallet. We make very effective use of AI and ML. We have the global capabilities. We're strongest, I believe, in compliance, and kind of noted by Gartner and others.
The second area where I do think we're differentiated are in our service levels. And if I look at the client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS in implementation, or if I look at when they go live, I do believe our NPS scores are probably best inside market. And those 2 things combined, really a great client experience with leading technology.
We're also not stagnant on the technology. If you look at the work that Joe is doing, remember Joe is our Chief Product and Technology Officer, the work that he's doing over there in terms of user experience, really, a focus on data and the intelligence, so the use of AI and ML, some of the lift that we're doing to the various talent modules at the moment and also the work that we're doing in terms of inoperability, really have -- I think are best-in-class."

So there are a few things with us. There's a lot of focus now on employee communications. We launched the Dayforce Hub recently, and what that is, it's effectively a homepage that a customer can tailor based on jurisdiction, type of employee, I think put their branding on it, they can make a look until really meet their own personality.
You can have deep linking inside our application or deep linking to external applications as well. You can have time-sensitive content and action items for the people. And that's obviously to be a central communication hub, which is very powerful. As I mentioned, we used them internally to relaunch our values and very successfully.
Second, on the recruiting side, we're obviously seeing a lot on talent acquisition. Now on the talent acquisition, we just acquired Ideal. And what Ideal really has is that they have AI that is used for grading of the candidates who apply. And it's a true machine learning algorithm, which means that if the hiring manager or a recruiter doesn't agree with the grade, they can correct and the system learns based on behavior.
They also have great capability from a DEI perspective. So when you're actually going through the candidates, you're making sure that you don't have any type of bias across the hiring managers, and we believe we can use that capability as well in areas like performance management and the like.
We're very, very strong on employee onboarding. And when I talk about employee onboarding, the single application becomes very powerful because you normally start off with a landing page. We have a message from the CEO, it's a multimedia. You then go into the sign-offs and instead of just saying, hey, have you read the code, the company ethics or behavior or privacy, you now embed learning directly into that experience. You take the course and then it signs you off. You have the various checklists, the various forms that can now be completed digitally, which obviously help tremendously.
We then typically bring in benefit enrollment. So we go through the benefit decision support to make it already pleasing experience. You typically bring in a bit more learning management. So you have on-the-job training, set up the person's 30-day, 60-day, 90-day development plans and the like. And so it's very -- it works very, very nicely.
Now the same onboarding modules use what we call transporting. So you can think about people returning to work and putting together a proper experience when people will be coming back to offices that don't look the same that they were before the COVID pandemic. So obviously, a big uptick in that as well.
We also are doing quite nicely on areas like engagement. As I mentioned before, it's a top concern for any CEO, making sure that engagement levels are holding while people are at home, ability to do poll surveys for engagement surveys, leveraging again a lot of intelligence features like sentiment analysis to read through the comments so that you can make sure that any comments that aren't positive are dealt with correctly. So obviously, quite a lot.
Also what is another area is on the global side. In today's work-from-home using tools like Zoom and such, where someone sits is no longer as important as it was prior to the pandemic. And so the ability to have global payroll capability, being able to do things like compensation management, either in a constant currency or in a local currency, from a budgeting perspective, it becomes very, very important, but also to handle how do you pay people, they're in Brazil or they're in Portugal or if they're in the U.S., Canada, in a single system. All of those seem to be driving the add-ons."

Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before we go to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on the key points from the quarter.
First, we had strong financial performance in the first quarter that was meaningful beat of guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 21%. First quarter sales were significantly above 2019 and 2020, and we expect sales momentum to continue reflecting a strong sales pipeline and pent-up demand. Second, we are excited to say that we expect total revenue in 2021 to exceed $1 billion, a significant milestone for Ceridian.
Looking forward to the rest of the year, in the second quarter of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue ex float to grow 28% to 29% year-over-year. And for the second half of 2021, we expect Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow above 29% compared to the second half of 2020.
Finally, Dayforce Wallet continues to go very well, and we remain confident in the Wallet strategy. We continue to see traction in registration, and we are seeing registration rates now of over 20%. We have more than 150 customers using the Wallet, and over 450 have signed up in total. Attach rates on new sales have continued to be approximately 80%. In April, we launched Dayforce Wallet in Canada and already have more than 40 customers signed up. Throughout 2021, we'll continue to introduce new features into Dayforce Wallet to increase employee adoption and to drive Dayforce sale.
In summary, we believe we are extremely well positioned to capture market share, extend our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.
I would like to now hand it back to Jeremy to open our call for questions."

And in customers that have been using the product the longest, we are seeing it almost at 30%, if not higher in some cases.
In terms of the usage pattern, the typical active user uses a product about half a dozen times per month, typically loading on about $120 per time. So we're seeing quite high usage of it.
In terms of the features that we are adding to the product, there will be 2 additional feature rollouts this year, one in June and one in the second half. In June, we're adding features for a virtual card. So you don't need to have the plastic present to do a transaction. We're adding direct deposit capability, which means I, as an employee, will be able to just, with a single click, say I'd like to stream my payroll to my Wallet at the end of every day. Currently, the user has to go to the Wallet app, say, hey, I'd like to add $100 to my Wallet. This will be completely fluid without the user having to do that. Obviously, with guardrails for the user, how much they would like to add or what they're going to do, balances and such.
We're adding additional pay card capability, which, as you know, makes it viable for minors to use the product as well. And then we're adding some notification capabilities to the actual product as well, so nudges and such.
In the second half of the year, we expect to launch savings for the Wallet balance. We'll have various types of referral programs. We'll be launching our reward programs, more in-app self-service, change of PIN, things like that, enhanced notifications, and we'll be starting moving to areas of financial wellness.
So we have quite a robust road map for the actual Wallet. And as we mentioned, all of these features, we believe, will add to more adoption of the Wallet, higher usage, but also will help us in the Dayforce sales side as well."

We do sell, in North America and EMEA, payroll, payroll and workforce management, without the HCM components. We've done that at many of the very large customers. And in that case, often, the ERP is a system of record, and they're bringing best of breeds for some of the talent components. So I believe the same pattern will be in APJ as well.
Now there is an upsell for customers that I'll say are in the major market segment to the small enterprise segment. And in those cases, we do believe there is a strong upsell possibility for workforce management, core HR and all the talent modules we have as well. 
In terms of the strategy, we spoke a bit about it in the shareholder letter. Over a 4- to 5-year period, we expect to migrate the accounts over to Dayforce. The Ascender acquisition brings with it several different products. There are 2 products in Australia. One is a major market product, one is more for government, education and larger enterprises.
On the major market product, we are already beginning our migrations. In the enterprise, education and government sector, we have to add some capabilities to the Dayforce application. Now in the rest of Asia, with the exception of Japan, we have been building, alongside the R&D team of Excelity, a Dayforce payroll factory for most of the countries across Asia. And we believe to have that online relatively soon, which will give us native capability for Dayforce across all of those geographies, and we'll be able to start the migration.
And then in Japan, there is a separate product that Ascender has in Japan. We intend to keep that product given the uniqueness of that particular market."

First, from a sales execution, our sales team has now begun to work very well with the SIs. And we have examples now, successful examples of where we have signed new contracts with SIs priming the Dayforce implementation.
You'll see that reflected in some of the professional services numbers. So you'll see less professional services growth year-over-year as some of the SIs are now doing the implementations. And you'll see that in the way that we reflect some of the numbers. For example, the Dayforce incremental revenue and such, we'll now start to focus on recurring revenue because we expect the SIs to begin priming on that particular side.
But in terms of number, in terms of depth of relationship, in terms of success in having the SIs primed and also success in the SIs bringing us some very, very nice deals. In fact, we recently closed a large deal in the EMEA region in, I believe, under an 8-week period that was primed by an SI and brought to us by an SI.

But we're now seeing effectively a close rate of about 15% of those people who attend the actual summits. And just given the breadth of how large these summits are, the large summit had, I believe, 700 attendees, and we have another summit coming up relatively quickly.
In terms of the actual wins, it's hard to say a favorite. I don't think you're allowed to say that. All of our customers are our favorites. But there are some that I really do think that are great. If you look at the size of some of them, we called out one in particular in the shareholder letter, where we talked about a large kind of health care organization. I was quite involved with them as well. It is quite a competitive deal against the regular competitors and some of the ERPs that you'll suspect to be playing. And I believe the way that we explained the value proposition as to where we could really create quantifiable value to the customer worked very nice.

So there's a fewer okays that you have to do. And then you get your plastic in the mail just a few days later.
In fact, when we launched in Canada, I was one of the first users to use the app, and it is really easy to use. So we don't get any pushback from the customers in that this is too difficult to do. From a payroll administration piece as well, it doesn't complicate the process. There's no reconciliation that the payroll team has to do. They don't have to change the way that they do the funding. It's not a bolt-on system. It's just embedded with inside the application. We've had tremendous feedback from the customers that are using the Wallet in terms of ease-of-use benefit to their employees. And we've got a whole bunch of case studies where employees have written to us talking about the benefit from a financial well-being perspective.
So we remain very, very confident. I believe the direct deposit and the streaming of pay feature that will launch in the June release is going to be very, very well accepted."

And we're seeing also some increased spend in sales and marketing. As we are expanding our capabilities with large enterprise customer sellers, we're building the SI partnerships and so on. So that translates into a higher sales and marketing that we are also -- you're going to see also throughout the year.

So Matt, look, I think there's been a benefit to demand across the pandemic. And it's gone in phases. In the first phase, I think a lot of the companies who are still relying on paper forms, paper manual processes or had on-prem systems were in a mad rush to get into the cloud and to digitize all of the interactions with their employees. And that has continued to drive demand.
What we're finding now is that when I call out and I speak to customers, and I speak to probably about 20 customers per week, what I'm finding across the C-level is that there is a real concern that with people having been working at home for over a year, that it is becoming more difficult to maintain the culture and the bonding at an organization. And so a lot of organizations are looking for products like us that can really help communicate and bring employees together so that you can maintain and strengthen culture and obviously keep engagement levels very high.
In the shareholder letter, I spoke about how we -- or how I've been describing how we've used the application. Firstly, we used the hub that we recently launched. And we did that because we revised our values. We removed 1, added 2, and so we used that as a way of communicating the new values to our employee group with embedded training on all the different values, embedded videos and such.
Second, we've been using the DEI dashboard from an ESG perspective, and that's been very, very helpful for me to actually see trends and to make sure we're moving in the right direction to make sure that we have proper diversity and balance inside our executive team, and it's gone very, very nicely. We've been using the engagement features to keep a score on track on what our eNPS levels have been, making sure that we're addressing important items for the employees.
And lastly, the Dayforce Wallet really has given our employees much better financial flexibility and wellness. And those are the things that people are looking for because when you bring it together, that keeps the company together, and in times like this, this is very important. And I believe those are the reasons that we've seen such a strong demand for our product."

He's done a really, really great job.
When it comes to M&A strategy, as you know, we are focused on the regional consolidation play. And I've spoken about that before. There are many companies out there that are in particular jurisdictions that have legacy technology, typically focused only on the payroll side, great opportunity for us to acquire a nice multiple, use the knowledge, their people, their operations to really build out that capability quickly inside Dayforce and then, over time, look at migrating their customers onto the Dayforce platform, and we get tremendous benefit elsewhere in the world by having that capability in that particular region.
We spoke about that on the last shareholder letter, how we were seeing pickup in global sales because of our APJ capability, and that's continued. We are looking at other regions around the world now. And I would expect that we'll do some transactions like that over the next couple of years.
The other area of M&A where we've been quite active, and you see this with the Ideal acquisition, which I've got to say is really a great piece of software, the team is exceptionally strong. We're talking about a big group of data scientists with very deep knowledge in terms of talent and talent acquisition. We had been partnering with them on the Dayforce side for over a 2-year period, already had embedded it inside the product. So we knew what the product could actually do.
But we are looking for acquisitions like that as well, where you acquire a specific type of capability that allows us to leverage that capability inside the Dayforce product to get more of an advantage relative to our competitors. Another example where you saw that was on the benefits side, Clearview Logix. We acquired them several years ago. That gave us the benefit decision support, the benefit intelligence piece, also which has gone really, really nicely in market. So yes, I do think M&A of those 2 different flavors will be a part of our future."

And you've seen that. If you read through the shareholder letter, you'll see some great examples of some very large organizations.
Four, we move on a global basis. And I think our execution in UKI has been wonderful. If I look at the deals that we're signing in the EMEA region, they already are tremendous, and we're only 2 years out of the gate there. The moves that we're making now in APJ obviously support that as well. And I expect we'll make similar types of moves elsewhere in the world. And so that's going very, very nicely. And then we've always spoken about adjacent products like the Wallet, which allows us to drive more recurring revenue from the people who use our systems.
Now in order to do that, we have to obviously invest quite heavily in talent. If you look at the people that we brought on, people like Noemie, people like Rocky, people like Leagh, people like Joe, all of the individuals that we have brought in have experience at scale and they have experience on a global basis. And that gives us the confidence that we can execute against those 5 different growth levers, and I think we have.

Without a doubt, having the Wallet has helped our win rate, and there probably are 2 reasons for that. The first is we always speak about that we're differentiated in market in that we have a continuous calc engine, which means that when you change a timesheet, an HR record, a benefit record, we immediately calculate the net earnings. The Wallet leverages that capability. And so when we talk about being able to offer the Wallet, it also clearly explains to the customer the advantage of having a continuous calc engine which the others don't have. And so I do think it has helped us tremendously.
Second, when we speak to the HR team and we speak about talent and about how we can improve the engagement, deliver benefit and also improve their ability to attract new people into the organization, we have some tremendous stats coming from the Wallet. And we spoke about them last time, that we found that when we look at active cardholders versus nonactive cardholders in the same companies, the voluntary attrition rate goes down by 42%. And when we talk about the speed of filling an open job vacancy, we see that improving by about 10%. And those are really, really great numbers.
In terms of industries, I can actually just look at it right here, look at it kind of live for you. And so if I look at my kind of industry dashboard over here, we're seeing kind of success right across industries, with peak at the moment in retail, professional services, manufacturing, financial services and construction."

The second area where I do think we're differentiated are in our service levels. And if I look at the client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS in implementation, or if I look at when they go live, I do believe our NPS scores are probably best inside market. And those 2 things combined, really a great client experience with leading technology.
We're also not stagnant on the technology. If you look at the work that Joe is doing, remember Joe is our Chief Product and Technology Officer, the work that he's doing over there in terms of user experience, really, a focus on data and the intelligence, so the use of AI and ML, some of the lift that we're doing to the various talent modules at the moment and also the work that we're doing in terms of interoperability, really have -- I think are best-in-class."

So there are a few things with us. There's a lot of focus now on employee communications. We launched the Dayforce Hub recently, and what that is, it's effectively a homepage that a customer can tailor based on jurisdiction, type of employee, I think put their branding on it, they can make it look and feel a really meet their own personality.
You can have deep linking inside our application or deep linking to external applications as well. You can have time-sensitive content and action items for the people. And that's obviously to be a central communication hub, which is very powerful. As I mentioned, we used them internally to relaunch our values and very successfully.
Second, on the recruiting side, we're obviously seeing a lot on talent acquisition. Now on the talent acquisition, we just acquired Ideal. And what Ideal really has is that they have AI that is used for grading of the candidates who apply. And it's a true machine learning algorithm, which means that if a hiring manager or a recruiter doesn't agree with the grade, they can correct and the system learns based on behavior.
They also have great capability from a DEI perspective. So when you're actually going through the candidates, you're making sure that you don't have any type of bias across the hiring managers, and we believe we can use that capability as well in areas like performance management and the like.
We're very, very strong on employee onboarding. And when I talk about employee onboarding, the single application becomes very powerful because you normally start off with a landing page. We have a message from the CEO, it's a multimedia. You then go into the sign-offs and instead of just saying, hey, have you read the code, the company ethics or behavior or privacy, you now embed learning directly into that experience. You take the course and then it signs you off. You have the various checklists, the various forms that can now be completed digitally, which obviously help tremendously.
We then typically bring in benefit enrollment. So we go through the benefit decision support to make it a really pleasing experience. You typically bring in a bit more learning management. So you have on-the-job training, set up the person's 30-day, 60-day, 90-day development plans and the like. And so it's very -- it works very, very nicely.
Now the same onboarding modules use what we call transporting. So you can think about people returning to work and putting together a proper experience when people will be coming back to offices that don't look the same that they were before the COVID pandemic. So obviously, a big uptick in that as well.
We also are doing quite nicely on areas like engagement. As I mentioned before, it's a top concern for any CEO, making sure that engagement levels are holding while people are at home, ability to do poll surveys, full engagement surveys, leveraging again a lot of intelligence features like sentiment analysis to read through the comments so that you can make sure that any comments that aren't positive are dealt with correctly. So obviously, quite a lot.
Also what is another area is on the global side. In today's work-from-home using tools like Zoom and such, where someone sits is no longer as important as it was prior to the pandemic. And so the ability to have global payroll capability, being able to do things like compensation management, either in a constant currency or in a local currency, from a budgeting perspective, it becomes very, very important, but also to handle how do you pay people, they're in Brazil or they're in Portugal or if they're in the U.S., Canada, in a single system. All of those seem to be driving the add-ons."

Before we go into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some key points from the quarter. First, we had strong financial performance in the second quarter. Our results were meaningfully above guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 30%. Total revenue, including Powerpay and Bureau also grew by 30%. Cloud recurring gross margin was 72%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and up 200 basis points, excluding float revenue. 
Based on our solid execution and increased confidence in employment levels at our customers, we are raising our guidance, and we now expect third quarter Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow 31% to 32%; fourth quarter Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow 32% to 33%; full year total revenue between $1.08 billion and [ $1.18 billion ]; adjusted EBITDA between $155 million and $165 million. 
We were also pleased with our second quarter sales performance, which was both above 2019 and 2020. We continue to see success in the enterprise and large enterprise segment, and we also saw solid traction in the major market segments. Our pipeline is strong, and we expect healthy sales performance to continue into the second half of 2021. 
Second, employee count at our Dayforce customers began to show improvement compared to the last quarter. The average employee count per Dayforce customer is now larger than pre-pandemic levels, reflective of our movement to enterprise and also better employment levels. This is expected to positively benefit our second half revenue. 
Finally, we have seen strong market momentum for Dayforce Wallet. We now have more than 600 customers signed with over 200 customers live on the Dayforce Wallet. Inside our top quartile of live customers, registration rates are averaging about 40% of eligible users. We are now seeing impressive traction and spending patterns further positioning the Dayforce card as top-of-wallet, go-to card for spending earned money. The average active wallet holder loads money onto their wallet 5 to 6x per month at an average of approximately $120 below. And in addition, an average active user transacts with the card approximately 24 times per month, almost every day. 
In summary, our execution was strong across segments and geographies, and our financial performance exceeded expectations. We are seeing significant momentum across all areas of the company. 
We also have reopened our offices in the U.S. And I've been thrilled to see the level of engagement from our employees whom I have met in various town halls across the country. I have also been busy visiting our customers at their offices throughout the U.S., and some consistent themes have emerged: first, their desire to improve the well-being and productivity of their workforce; second, their challenges to maintain and unify the company culture in an environment where employees expect and do work from anywhere in our hybrid fashion; and finally, their difficulties attracting and retaining talent in a very competitive talent market. I left each of these in-person conversations with the conviction that we are uniquely positioned to address these challenges and help our customers be more competitive. 
I would now like to hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions."

We also have added a messaging component into the actual system that will allow us to, again, encourage people to use the system.

The Ascender line was $22.9 million, broken down into day recurring revenue which came in at $5 million versus $4.5 million that we had expected. Dayforce professional services came in at $1.2 million versus the $1.5 million that we had expected, and Bureau came in at [ $16.7 million versus $15 million ], but there were some purchase accounting adjustments that were inside that particular number. When you look at Q3 and Q4, we would expect, and included in our guidance, $4.5 million per quarter on Dayforce recurring revenue, $1.5 million on Dayforce professional services and $15 million on the actual Bureau side. The migration begins as we mentioned, in the second half of the year, but remember that it will take time to activate those accounts. So you aren't going to see the impact of that really until 2022. 
One other data point that we did call out inside the shareholders' letter is that when we look at RITEQ, which we purchased about 2 years ago, the Dayforce revenue that we have sold to those accounts now exceeds the total revenue of RITEQ at the time of purchase. So it's really a great data point about the strategy that we can position Dayforce. And as we do that, we get the upsell of the talent modules, the workforce management modules, which obviously increase the revenue that we can expect from those customers. Noemie, anything you would add?"

As I mentioned, in the top quartile, about 40% registration rates across the clients, which I would argue is a bit ahead of what we had expected. The second part is the loads that we're seeing have gone up slightly, but they're effectively 6x per month and at over $120 per load. And then on the spend time, we're seeing the cards be used almost daily. The average usage of the card is in excess of 24x per month. The typical types of transactions is what you would expect. They are grocery purchases, convenience stores, gas, ATM withdrawals, which is the majority of the transactions. In terms of further ways of monetizing that, we are going to launch a cash-back program with a particular partner where there is a revenue share, and we believe that could add about 0.9% of the actual spend, if you like, into revenue. There are other programs that we are looking at, things like buy now, pay later programs that I think were further added.

If I look at the number of deals that we have in pipe today for global deals versus last year, or if I look at from a deployment perspective, the number of countries we currently are deploying in now versus what we were deploying in about a year ago. They're up in double digits. So we're talking really tremendous growth and tremendous opportunity coming through. In terms of ANZ, which is actually APJ as well, there are 1,500 customers we have between Excelity and between Ascender. All of them, obviously, will lead to Dayforce. When we move to Dayforce, we obviously position the entire talent suite as well as the workforce management and payroll, which does give us a nice lift in revenue. And as I mentioned, with RITEQ, I think we've been able to prove that out that, as we migrate, a single application, like in RITEQ's case, workforce management only. So we sell payroll, we sell talent to the workforce management accounts. In the case of Excelity and in the case of Ascender, it's now selling workforce management, core HR and talent components onto that. We see a nice lift in revenue. 
We also are seeing tremendous benefit from having the APJ assets on our -- on how attractive we are on a global basis to sell with companies that have operations around the world. So we're very optimistic about global. And we also do believe it is a differentiation of us relative to both the ERPs and the other HCM providers."

The second is you have to allow them to prime the actual implementation so that they can take the customers live and get references. And once you do that, I think you do get the lift in pipeline. So the majority of pipeline lift, I think we're still probably a quarter or 2 away as we need to complete the implementation -- or the SIs have to complete the implementations. We are seeing some benefit already in terms of deals where we are seeing a positive impact of the SI influence coming through. 
But another point that I think I'd like to make as well is that we are operating in a tight talent market. And the fact that we now have 19 SIs that have capability to implement is helping us because it does allow us to continue to grow and scale the company without having to hire people directly. And I think that in retrospect, it was a fantastic move to be able to build out a bench of very capable people across a range of very accomplished organizations."

One other data point that I'll probably refer you to, if you look at the average float balance of our customers, the average float balance is up 27% year-over-year, which is usually indicative of the size of the payrolls across our customers. So another good kind of data point that the economy is coming back very strong."

And the energy inside the town halls was just wonderful to see just people smiling and happy to be together. Next week, I'm in Chicago, doing another kind of departmental town hall, and then I'm going off to visit 2 clients as well in kind of the Midwest West area. And I'm obviously very eager for that. 
And then a week or so after that, I'm in the West Coast, going to San Fran and LA. In L.A., we have a nice client event. I also participated in a recent user group. And so the user group is a group that's run outside of Ceridian. They run it from base camp. I was asked to kind of just join in the Q&A section. And at the end of that, I asked the question. I asked if the user group would like to get together in person if we were to help sponsor it as part of the world term. And we had 141 customers respond that they'd like to attend in person. So the world is definitely moving to getting out in front of people developing relationships, building on interactions. But I would say that we are still going to be operating in a hybrid world where we can get kind of the best of virtual types of events, virtual types of selling. So a lot of digital types of programs and such mixed together with the right experiences for in-person events and such."

And we brought in great people into the organization, particularly in sales leadership, that know how to communicate with the SIs and know how to communicate as well with the large enterprises. 
One of the areas that's driving the wins we're seeing upmarket is our global capability that if you compare us with the big HR, workforce management payroll on a global basis, we have a lot more to offer and the solution is much better architected than others in market. And so that does help us. When I look at the enterprise segment, in the upper end or major market, we're also seeing tremendous success in the talent side. So when we brought in Joe and we brought in a number of other people, also very, very strong in talent and in data and in AI, that's now begin to show through the actual product and show through the product road map, which further has allowed us to move upmarket and to also continue selling to the base."

Our results wer",544,"Thanks, Jeremy, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. 
Before we go into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on some key points from the quarter. First, we had strong financial performance in the second quarter. Our results were meaningfully above guidance across all metrics. Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, grew by 30%. Total revenue, including Powerpay and Bureau, also grew by 30%. Cloud recurring gross margin was 72%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and up 200 basis points, excluding float revenue. 
Based on our solid execution and increased confidence in employment levels at our customers, we are raising our guidance, and we now expect third quarter Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow 31% to 32%; fourth quarter Dayforce recurring revenue, excluding float revenue, to grow 32% to 33%; full year total revenue between $1.008 billion and $1.018 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $155 million and $165 million. 
We were also pleased with our second quarter sales performance, which was both above 2019 and 2020. We continue to see success in the enterprise and large enterprise segments, and we also saw solid traction in the major market segments. Our pipeline is strong, and we expect healthy sales performance to continue into the second half of 2021. 
Second, employee count at our Dayforce customers began to show improvement compared to the last quarter. The average employee count per Dayforce customer is now larger than pre-pandemic levels, reflective of our move into enterprise and also better employment levels. This is expected to positively benefit our second half revenue. 
Finally, we have seen strong market momentum for Dayforce Wallet. We now have more than 600 customers signed with over 200 customers live on the Dayforce Wallet. Inside our top quartile of live customers, registration rates are averaging about 40% of eligible users. We are now seeing impressive traction and spending patterns further positioning the Dayforce card as top-of-wallet, go-to card for spending earned money. The average active wallet holder loads money onto their wallet 5 to 6x per month at an average of approximately $120 below. And in addition, an average active user transacts with the card approximately 24 times per month, almost every day. 
In summary, our execution was strong across segments and geographies, and our financial performance exceeded expectations. We are seeing significant momentum across all areas of the company. 
We also have reopened our offices in the U.S. And I've been thrilled to see the level of engagement from our employees whom I have met in various town halls across the country. I have also been busy visiting our customers at their offices throughout the U.S. And some consistent themes have emerged: first, their desire to improve the well-being and productivity of their workforce; second, their challenges to maintain and unify the company culture in an environment where employees expect and do work from anywhere in a hybrid fashion; and finally, their difficulties attracting and retaining talent in a very competitive talent market. I left each of these in-person conversations with the conviction that we are uniquely positioned to address these challenges and help our customers be more competitive. 
I would now like to hand it back to Jeremy to open the call up for questions."

Dayforce professional services came in at $1.2 million (sic) [ $1.1 million ] versus the $1.5 million that we had expected. And Bureau came in at $16.7 million (sic) [ $16.8 million ] versus $15 million, but there were some purchase accounting adjustments that were inside that particular number. When you look at Q3 and Q4, we would expect, and included in our guidance, $4.5 million per quarter on Dayforce recurring revenue, $1.5 million on Dayforce professional services and $15 million on the actual Bureau side. The migration begins, as we mentioned, in the second half of the year. But remember that it will take time to activate those accounts, so you aren't going to see the impact of that really until 2022. 
One other data point that we did call out inside the shareholders' letter is that when we look at RITEQ, which we purchased about 2 years ago, the Dayforce revenue that we have sold to those accounts now exceeds the total revenue of RITEQ at the time of purchase. So it's really a great data point about the strategy that we can position Dayforce. And as we do that, we get the upsell of the talent modules, the workforce management modules, which obviously increase the revenue that we can expect from those customers. 
Noemie, anything you would add?"

As I mentioned, in the top quartile, about 40% registration rates across the clients which, I would argue, is a bit ahead of what we had expected. The second part is the loads that we're seeing have gone up slightly, but they're effectively 6x per month and at over $120 per load. And then on the spend time, we're seeing the cards be used almost daily. The average usage of the card is in excess of 24 times per month. The typical types of transactions is what you would expect. They are grocery purchases, convenience stores, gas, ATM withdrawals, which is the majority of the transactions. 
In terms of further ways of monetizing that, we are going to launch a cash-back program with a particular partner where there is a revenue share. And we believe that could add about 0.9% of the actual spend, if you like, into revenue. There are other programs that we are looking at, things like pay now -- sorry, buy now, pay later programs that I think were further added. And then as we get into more of the financial wellness side, is really a tremendous opportunity for us. Thanks, Mike. You're actually muted. I'm not sure if you're aware."

If I look at the number of deals that we have in pipe today for global deals versus last year, or if I look at from a deployment perspective, the number of countries we currently are deploying in now versus what we were deploying in about a year ago, they're up in double digits. So we're talking really tremendous growth and tremendous opportunity coming through. 
In terms of ANZ, which is actually APJ as well, there are 1,500 customers we have between Excelity and between Ascender. All of them, obviously, will lead to Dayforce. When we move to Dayforce, we obviously position the entire talent suite as well as the workforce management and payroll, which does give us a nice lift in revenue. And as I mentioned, with RITEQ, I think we've been able to prove that out that, as we migrate, a single application, like in RITEQ's case, it's workforce management only, so we sell payroll, we sell talent to the workforce management accounts. In the case of Excelity and in the case of Ascender, it's now selling workforce management, core HR and talent components onto that. We see a nice lift in revenue. 
We also are seeing tremendous benefit from having the APJ assets on our -- on how attractive we are on a global basis to sell with companies that have operations around the world. So we're very optimistic about global. And we also do believe it is a differentiation of us relative to both the ERPs and the other HCM providers."

So the majority of pipeline lift, I think we're still probably a quarter or 2 away as we need to complete the implementations -- or the SIs have to complete the implementations. We are seeing some benefit already in terms of deals where we are seeing a positive impact of the SI influence coming through. 
But another point that I think I'd like to make as well is that we are operating in a tight talent market. And the fact that we now have 19 SIs that have capability to implement is helping us because it does allow us to continue to grow and scale the company without having to hire people directly. And I think that in retrospect, it was a fantastic move to be able to build out a bench of very capable people across a range of very accomplished organizations."

And you can further go back a year before. If you look at Q2 of '18, it was $3.35 billion. So there is definitely a significant increase in the float balance in Q2. And we also saw, if you remember, an increase in the float balance in Q1. So it's a very good sign that the economy is coming back strong."

And to kind of give you an idea, normally, when you do these client dinners, they go from like 6:00 to 8:39. This went from 6:00 to 12:30 a.m. So I would say there's just a huge pent-up demand for people to get out and to interact again. I did 2 town halls. I did 1 in Tampa, and I did 1 in Minneapolis. And the energy inside the town halls was just wonderful to see, just people smiling and happy to be together. Next week, I'm in Chicago, doing another kind of departmental town hall, and then I'm going off to visit 2 clients as well in kind of the Midwest West area. And I'm obviously very eager for that. And then a week or so after that, I'm in the West Coast, going to San Fran and LA. In L.A., we have a nice client event. 
I also participated in a recent user group. And so the user group is a group that's run outside of Ceridian. They run it from base camp. I was asked to kind of just join in the Q&A section. And at the end of that, I asked the question. I asked if the user group would like to get together in person if we were to help sponsor it as part of the World Tour. And we had 141 customers respond that they'd like to attend in person. So the world is definitely moving to getting out in front of people, developing relationships, building on interactions. But I would say that we are still going to be operating in a hybrid world where we can get kind of the best of virtual types of events, virtual types of selling. So a lot of digital types of programs and such mixed together with the right experiences for in-person events and such."

We made changes to the way that we actually sell. As you know, we verticalized. We brought in value advisory people who are able to kind of communicate the ROI and get ahead of the RFI/RFP process. We have invested and continue to invest very heavily in the SI channels who do influence those particular types of deals. And we brought in great people into the organization, particularly in sales leadership, that know how to communicate with the SIs and know how to communicate as well with the large enterprises. 
One of the areas that's driving the wins we're seeing upmarket is our global capability that, if you compare us with the big core HR, workforce management payroll on a global basis, we have a lot more to offer and the solution is much better architected than others in market. And so that does help us. When I look at the enterprise segment, in the upper end or major market, we're also seeing tremendous success in the talent side. So when we brought in Joe and we brought in a number of other people, also very, very strong in talent and in data and in AI, that's now begin to show through the actual product and show through the product road map, which further has allowed us to move upmarket and to also continue selling to the base."

But it's really making use of data and user experience to do it correctly. And so that is driving a lot of it.

Dayforce recurring",707,"Thank you, Erik, and welcome, everyone, to our Q3 earnings call. Let me say a few quick words about the quarter before we open it up for general Q&A. We had a very solid quarter with continued great execution across the entire business. Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float grew on a GAAP basis by 33% or on a constant currency basis by 31%. Total revenue increased on a GAAP basis by 26% or 24% on a constant currency basis. For the fiscal year of 2021, we slightly increased the guidance and we narrowed the range to $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. On the gross cloud margin, we saw an improvement of the gross cloud margin to 72.7%, which is up to 90 basis points on a constant currency basis and up 70 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Customer POP accounts increased by about 11% year-over-year, and the average size of the customers also increased about 11%, and on a 12-month basis, we have taken live about 523 customers. Float balances also increased by about 25%. The float income was negatively impacted by a slight decline in the yield by 36 basis points. 
Adjusted EBITDA was 39.4%, which is up 20 basis points on an exfloat basis. On the Dayforce Wallet, we continue to see very strong metrics. The number of customers live on Dayforce quality is now above 290 customers. We have sold over 800 accounts at this point in time. We saw registration rates across the eligible employees who have access to the wallets grow to about 29%. And when we look at the top quartile of tenured customers, we see registration rates above 50%. Usage of the wallet continues to be very healthy with an average number of transactions of above 25 transactions per month. 
In early October, we closed on an acquisition of Data Fusion, which further increases our compliance advantage and gives us specific capabilities for certified payroll reporting, prevailing wage rate calculations, incentive payments, union rate calculations and very complex general ledger reporting. This technology is immediately available and will be integrated into Dayforce. This acquisition will obviously help accelerate our growth in construction, government contracting, manufacturing, unionized environment, the public sector and not for profit. 
Also in the first week of October, we held our first in-person customer event in over 2 years with the first stop of the Ceridian World Tour in Las Vegas. At the CWT event, we shared our vision for Dayforce to deliver the always on people platform for the global workforce, which is anchored by our brand promise of making work life better. A few highlights of the event. We had some product announcements, including the announcement of Screamin Pay, which is the automatic delivery of earnings and net earnings to our employees' Dayforce Wallets. We announced the HR service delivery, which is an end-to-end employee solution that provides an always on HR compliance support. And we also discussed Dayforce Talent Intelligence, a suite of new transformative talent management solutions empowered by AI and data. 
We plan to build on the success with our next CWT Torstar in New York. This advantage is primarily focused on customers will also feature an investor track, including a session with the Ceridian executive team starting at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, November 11, that portion will be webcast, so please join us. You can find the information on our investor website on how to register the event or join this session via live webcast. 
I'm also very pleased to share that Ceridian was once again named a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management suites or enterprises above 1,000 employees. We believe this report further validates our vision, the innovation of the Dayforce product and our commitment to delivering quantifiable value for our customers. 
Before I hand it back to Erik, I would like to close by saying how proud I am of our Ceridian team across the globe. Our engagement metrics are up. Our culture remains vibrant as we alongside our customers transition to a new hybrid work environment and our purpose and our brand promise to make work life better has never been more clear and relevant. 
Erik, back to you."

I guess I wanted to start out, David, by asking the question of around the narrowing of the guidance range and particularly in the shareholder letter, you called out seeing some employment headwinds in your customer base of them not being able to hire at the pace or rehire at the pace that they wanted to. And it impacted the quarter. I'm assuming it impacted the guide somewhat. I wanted to ask a broader question, which is, how long do you anticipate this to be a headwind for the business? And are we -- if we step back and from a big picture perspective, look at the business, you're seeing clearly tailwinds around the war for talent and necessitating, a modernization initiative of many HR organizations and tools, but at the same time, you get paid per employee per month. And if you can't hire, then you can't pay Ceridian more. So work -- talk to us about those 2 dynamics, are they balancing out because new bookings are well ahead of where you thought you were going to be, and we can't see those numbers, we can only see the PEPM stuff, but that would be very helpful, I think?"

So for Q4, we had expected last time we spoke, a $1.5 million improvement in the headwind from employee accounts. As we pointed out in the shareholder leisure, we're seeing that it's taking slightly longer for our customers to fill their open job requisition. So we have decreased what we expect the improvement of Dayforce to be down by about $0.5 million. And that is the tightness that we've actually taken. So we've widened the Q4 guidance by corresponding by that amount. However, we have taken the beat that we had in Q3 to the full year guidance, if you like. So that gave us the increase in the actual guidance. 
In terms of the business, obviously, I do believe we have been executing tremendously well. But if I look at it from a pipeline perspective, it still remains very strong. And we are forecasting for the second half of the year, that sales will come in quite favorable to last year and to the year before that, which speaks obviously to the sales execution of the actual business. 
On the implementation, projects continue to be implemented, a lot of activity with our customers. And I'm actually seeing some tremendous feedback from our customers in terms of the NPS or the customer satisfaction levels as well. In terms of the tightness of the, if you like, the hiring market, I wish I had a magic mirror or something. But at this point, just looking at what we know, given the employment numbers that we did see in September, which remember, do give us October. And what we believe we saw in October, which gives us visibility into November, and what we're currently seeing in November, which will give us visibility to December. We believe our guidance range is pretty good."

We're continuing to invest in our product and technology. We saw we made some exciting product announcements recently. And your comment about hiring, we're actually very successful in attracting top talent in a tight labor market, which shows our brand is strong and our reputation is strong as well. 
We've made some significant investments in our R&D, as you saw, our cash sedan R&D went up from less than 10% of our total revenue in Q3 last year to above 13.6% this quarter. We've ramped up our services delivery capacity, which is kind of the timing thing that you see from Q3 to Q4 where we are ramping up to service our customers to go live in Q4, which is our largest go-live quarter. There's a lot of very large customers going live in Q4. And we're also focused on integrating the Data Fusion technology into the Dayforce platform. 
The other thing I would say is we've also reopened our offices throughout the summer in North America. We've returned to in-person meetings as well, which is very important for our people after having spent 2 years apart. And our sales reps are traveling to meet our customers and prospects throughout the fourth quarter. We've seen a lot of benefits, obviously, from digital selling, and we continue to invest in digital sales capability, that's not going to go away, that was a great learning from the pandemic times. But we also want our sales -- the sales and marketing team to be meeting customers and prospects on site, and we've done so quite successfully in Vegas as an example, and we continue to do that through Q4. So that explains a little bit the timing Q3 and Q4. But overall, our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range hasn't changed and our investment priority remained consistent."

What I can say, if I look at the business on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it's effectively doubling every quarter. So we're still going through the kind of the early stages of what I call hyper growth of it. Some of the metrics that I'll point you to I believe last quarter, we spoke about the average registration across all eligible employees to be about 25%. It's now over 29%. And when we look at customers that have been live over a year, we're seeing registration rates in the top quarter, well above 50% with the very strong usage metrics that we discussed. Those 25 transactions that people are doing every day live in. It's fast-food, grocery, convenience, gas, ATM withdrawals and the like. So that excites us quite nicely. 
In the quarter as well, we released 2 days early or up to 2 day early deposit, which means that if you're a day force wallet user, you can get paid when you want and say you take out 1/3 of your net earnings during the period, you'll remaining 2/3, you can get up to 2 days early as well. And again, the whole model is predicated on no direct fees to the employees, no membership fees, no fees to the organization. And every payment is a true payroll, which means it's fully compliant to get an earnings slip for every type of transfer. 
The streaming of pay will come online, as we mentioned, in 2022. We believe that will obviously accelerate because the idea over there is instead of doing an on-demand pay or having to wait for direct deposit as I work the pay automatically strains into my wallet, and we're talking about making access to your earnings completely instantaneous, and that will obviously be paired with quite a very rich financial wellness offering set with inside the actual product. So we are quite excited with it. 
Dayforce water, by the way, also has given us a tremendous advantage in market. We are still seeing attachment rates across new business well across 80%. And in every conversation that I have with clients, with early clients, the Dayforce Wallet is top of mind."

And we also have the capability through the Dayforce app to allow you to clock in and clock out via geo locations. 
In that case, what we can do is we can make it very easy for organizations to publish their vacancy. And a vacancy could be a number of hours, say, a shift that has to be worked. It could be a task such as a delivery or could be a longer-term assignment, say, a 3-, 4-week program in a sign. And along with the vacancy, the organization could publish the competencies required and possibly even some learning management contract. We can then allow all of the Dayforce Wallet users to look at their app and much like they'll be looking for awards around them, they'll be able to see the vacancies for which they have the right competencies. They could learn about the vacancy through the learning management content, apply, get matched and when they actually show up, they would show a QR code to clock in and clock out. And as soon as their hours were approved, they would actually get paid. And as Ceridian would be responsible for doing all the necessary remittances. We're doing all of the year-end filings, all of the different types of money movement. And you would go now from just not only having instant access to your earnings, but you'd have the ability to actually find work and get paid in real time, which we believe matches where the workforce is going. 
So we're quite excited with that opportunity. We've started the actual research and the build-out and the partnerships that I think will enable us to do that. Obviously, leveraging the great stuff that we already have through the Dayforce continuous calculation engine in the day or wallet payment rails."

And as we've always said, that KPI needs to be measurable and convertible into a money saving.

And as we've always said, that KPI needs to be measurable and convertible into a money saving. For us, we use the term quantifiable value, and I believe we're ranked #1 in industry in terms of delivering strong ROI. 
When we talk about the Dayforce Wallet, we talk about some very strong metrics that show basically the decrease in attrition rates. The decrease in the first 90-day attrition rates, the quicker time to actually hire someone. So as we actually build it out, it's always along the same lines. 
In terms of the talent intelligence. What we say today is the market operates in something called Talent 1.0. And at a high level, it's really people operating this list management framework. If I'm recruiting, I look at a list of candidates for a particular job requisition. I sought or I filter that list accordingly. I find the candidate that I'd like to act on, and then I go through a number of sequential steps usually manually driven. 
In Talent 2.0 that we're beginning to release now, we're moving more to a recommendation and prediction type of model, very similar to, for instance, when you go to Amazon or Netflix and those systems recommend either products that you would like or movie shows or TV shows that meet your requirements. We're doing the same now on the talent side. When I go to that list of candidates, it's not a list, but a set of recommended candidates that the system has predicted will be a good match based on who the hiring manager is and who the recruiter. And then even once we have that, we can go and use a lot of automation like align the candidate to self-schedule, when the candidate interacts with the system, we can engage with bot technology. So if the candidate is applying for 1 particular type of job based on the candidate who is applying and the available job requisitions, we can recommend back to the candidate where they may be a good fit for other opportunities, and at that point in time, get them to engage and or even complete the application for them. So it's effectively using ML models and AI models to go and look at what's been done currently in talent in order to engage with people in a much more natural manner that they would typically expect. 
In terms of the service task EBITDA, there's a lot of information that the Depot system has. As you know, we've already moved into natural workspaces, you can now engage with the system through Teams or through Slack in a very natural way. We can now allow the employee to ask questions about policy. What is the vacation policy as opposed to just how many days do I have? Am I eligible for something? And by doing that, we can take a lot of load off the HR department. And again, given that's driven off of ML type of model continually evolves, continually learned and becomes more of a natural way of interacting with the system. So obviously, a lot of site in order to get around intelligence and data. 
If you do come to the Ceridian World Tour, which [indiscernible] came in Vegas, but for others, you'll see Joe talk about that, and we actually have a few demonstrations of the technology, which is really exciting."

So it's a tremendous benefit to both the organization and to their employees. In fact, an organization could go from a weekly or biweekly peril to a monthly payroll and get a onetime lift of working capital as well. they wanted additional benefit. So I think that's becoming very important. The second is what I would say is that the desire to get paid immediately is becoming a requirement in business today. it's no longer optional. So the economy is moving there, and we have better tech than I think anyone else in the market in that every time we move the money, we do a true payroll that is fully compliant at federal on the state or provincial basis in Canada. And I think that's very, very strong as well. When we're going to some deals, we actually are seeing them very focused on the Dayforce wallet. There have been in some cases where that has allowed us to maintain or actually increase pricing just based on the advantage that we have inside the market. And the last piece as well is that I do believe it does help our brand with the employees of our customers.

When someone does an ACH transfer which, again, we don't see much of that, there isn't any fee to the actual employee. Next year, we will move into what they call OCT transfers or instant transfers. And over there, there is an ability to charge for that. Usually, it is 50 basis points up to a small cap that desire for that particular type of transfer. What we are seeing in terms of the usage of the wallet is becoming quite disruptive to the credit card industry. So instead of using the credit card, we're seeing a lot of the employees are now using the Dayforce card instead. In that way, there obviously are more on top of their finances and they don't get into a situation where they are paying the 22% on the balance of the actual statement at the end of the month. There's a big benefit from them. In terms of additional revenue opportunities, as we move into next year, we start moving into things like rewards and we'll probably move into the areas like buy now, pay later. And all of those types of opportunities address the ability to increase our take rate. For example, on the rewards, we would expect to get about 90 basis points on the actual spend for that particular type of item that was covered by the award and by nonpay later basis, there would obviously be a revenue share with the partner over there.

I've seen really tremendous traction in Germany, and we're launching the native payroll solution for Germany next year as well, and we're seeing quite a lot of interest in that. Once we have Germany, we obviously are going to expand into the other countries surrounding Germany to get a ruler footprint across them. 
The third area, as you pointed out, is across APJ. Obviously, the reason we're doing that is that we do have a lot of it we call bureau customers, so customers through the acquisitions of Extender and Acelity and RideTech. And as we build out the native capabilities for those regions, that gives us an opportunity to go back to the base and not only move their payroll onto Dayforce, but also add on things like time and attendance, workforce management, core HR and all of the talent modules, which obviously is a very large revenue opportunity for us. 
Also within APJ, we've got quite well kind of integrated go-to-market. So we have sales and marketing across the region, a big presence across areas like Singapore, A&D and other areas across. We also have service and implementation capabilities in market, which means we can get to market quite quickly.

It allows us to focus on really doing what we do great, which is build great software and deliver grade software and obviously service to create software.

Let me say a few quick words about the quarter before we open it up for general Q&A. We had a very solid quarter with continued great execution across the entire business. Dayforce recurring",707,"Thank you, Erik, and welcome, everyone, to our Q3 earnings call. Let me say a few quick words about the quarter before we open it up for general Q&A. We had a very solid quarter with continued great execution across the entire business. Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float grew on a GAAP basis by 33% or on a constant currency basis by 31%. Total revenue increased on a GAAP basis by 26% or 24% on a constant currency basis. For the fiscal year of 2021, we slightly increased the guidance and we narrowed the range to $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. On the gross cloud margin, we saw an improvement of the gross cloud margin to 72.7%, which is up to 90 basis points on a constant currency basis and up 70 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  
Customer POP accounts increased by about 11% year-over-year, and the average size of the customers also increased about 11%, and on a 12-month basis, we have taken live about 523 customers. Float balances also increased by about 25%, but float income was negatively impacted by a slight decline in the yield by 36 basis points.  
Adjusted EBITDA was 39.4%, which is up 20 basis points on an ex-float basis. On the Dayforce Wallet, we continue to see very strong metrics. The number of customers live on Dayforce Wallet is now above 290 customers. We have sold over 800 accounts at this point in time. We saw registration rates across the eligible employees who have access to the wallets grow to about 29%. And when we look at the top quartile of tenured customers, we see registration rates above 50%. Usage of the wallet continues to be very healthy with an average number of transactions of above 25 transactions per month.  
In early October, we closed on an acquisition of Data Fusion, which further increases our compliance advantage and gives us specific capabilities for certified payroll reporting, prevailing wage rate calculations, incentive payments, union rate calculations and very complex general ledger reporting. This technology is immediately available and will be integrated into Dayforce. This acquisition will obviously help accelerate our growth in construction, government contracting, manufacturing, unionized environments, the public sector and not for profit.  
Also in the first week of October, we held our first in-person customer event in over 2 years with the first stop of the Ceridian World Tour in Las Vegas. At the CWT event, we shared our vision for Dayforce to deliver the always on people platform for the global workforce, which is anchored by our brand promise of making work life better. A few highlights of the event. We had some product announcements, including the announcement of screaming pay, which is the automatic delivery of earnings and net earnings to our employees' Dayforce Wallets. We announced the HR service delivery, which is an end-to-end employee solution that provides an always on HR compliance support. And we also discussed Dayforce Talent Intelligence, a suite of new transformative talent management solutions empowered by AI and data.  
We plan to build on the success with our next CWT Torstar in New York. This advantage is primarily focused on customers will also feature an investor track, including a session with the Ceridian executive team starting at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, November 11, that portion will be webcast, so please join us. You can find the information on our investor website on how to register the event or join this session via live webcast.  
I'm also very pleased to share that Ceridian was once again named a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management suites or enterprises above 1,000 employees. We believe this report further validates our vision, the innovation of the Dayforce product and our commitment to delivering quantifiable value for our customers.  
Before I hand it back to Erik, I would like to close by saying how proud I am of our Ceridian team across the globe. Our engagement metrics are up. Our culture remains vibrant as we alongside our customers transition to a new hybrid work environment and our purpose and our brand promise to make work life better has never been more clear and relevant.  
Erik, back to you."

I guess I wanted to start out, David, by asking the question of around the narrowing of the guidance range and particularly in the shareholder letter, you called out seeing some employment headwinds in your customer base of them not being able to hire at the pace or rehire at the pace that they wanted to. And it impacted the quarter. I'm assuming it impacted the guide somewhat. I wanted to ask a broader question, which is, how long do you anticipate this to be a headwind for the business? And are we -- if we step back and from a big picture perspective, look at the business, you're seeing clearly tailwinds around the war for talent and necessitating, a modernization initiative of many HR organizations and tools, but at the same time, you get paid per employee per month. And if you can't hire, then you can't pay Ceridian more. So work -- talk to us about those 2 dynamics, are they balancing out because new bookings are well ahead of where you thought you were going to be, and we can't see those numbers, we can only see the PEPM stuff, but that would be very helpful, I think?"

So for Q4, we had expected last time we spoke, a $1.5 million improvement in the headwind from employee accounts. As we pointed out in the shareholder leisure, we're seeing that it's taking slightly longer for our customers to fill their open job requisitions. So we have decreased what we expect the improvement of Dayforce to be down by about $0.5 million. And that is the tightness that we've actually taken. So we've widened the Q4 guidance by corresponding by that amount. However, we have taken the beat that we had in Q3 to the full year guidance, if you like. So that gave us the increase in the actual guidance. 
In terms of the business, obviously, I do believe we have been executing tremendously well, that if I look at it from a pipeline perspective, it still remains very strong. And we are forecasting for the second half of the year, that sales will come in quite favorable to last year and to the year before that, which speaks obviously to the sales execution of the actual business. 
On the implementation, projects continue to be implemented, a lot of activity with our customers. And I'm actually seeing some tremendous feedback from our customers in terms of the NPS or the customer satisfaction levels as well. In terms of the tightness of the, if you like, the hiring market, I wish I had a magic mirror or something. But at this point, just looking at what we know, given the employment numbers that we did see in September, which remember, do give us October. And what we believe we saw in October, which gives us visibility into November, and what we're currently seeing in November, which will give us visibility into December. We believe our guidance range is pretty good."

We're continuing to invest in our product and technology. We saw we made some exciting product announcements recently. And your comment about hiring, we're actually very successful in attracting top talents in a tight labor market, which shows our brand is strong and our reputation is strong as well. 
We've made some significant investments in our R&D, as you saw, our cash spend on R&D went up from less than 10% of our total revenue in Q3 last year to above 13.6% this quarter. We've ramped up our services delivery capacity, which is kind of the timing thing that you see from Q3 to Q4 where we are ramping up to service our customers to go live in Q4, which is our largest go-live quarter. There's a lot of very large customers going live in Q4. And we're also focused on integrating the Data Fusion technology into the Dayforce platform. 
The other thing I would say is we've also reopened our offices throughout the summer in North America. We've returned to in-person meetings as well, which is very important for our people after having spent 2 years apart. And our sales reps are traveling to meet our customers and prospects throughout the fourth quarter. We've seen a lot of benefits, obviously, from digital selling, and we continue to invest in digital sales capability, that's not going to go away, that was a great learning from the pandemic times. But we also want our sales -- the sales and marketing team to be meeting customers and prospects on site, and we've done so quite successfully in Vegas as an example, and we continue to do that throughout Q4. So that explains a little bit the timing between Q3 and Q4. But overall, our full year adjusted EBITDA and guidance range hasn't changed and our investment priority remained consistent."

We definitely have advanced relative to all of the other players in the market in terms of global payroll and global core HR. Obviously, having a lot of success in market with companies that are headquartered outside of North America as well as companies inside North America that have global operations. At CWT, we actually discussed with the client base in 9 additional countries that we're adding in 2022 in terms of native payroll capability. And again, I think that just positions us very well in market to win these global accounts.

What I can say, if I look at the business on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it's effectively doubling every quarter. So we're still going through the kind of the early stages of what I call hyper growth of it. Some of the metrics that I'll point you to, I believe, last quarter, we spoke about the average registration across all eligible employees to be about 25%. It's now over 29%. And when we look at customers that have been live over a year, we're seeing registration rates in the top quarter, well above 50% with the very strong usage metrics that we discussed. Those 25 transactions that people are doing everyday living. It's fast-food, grocery, convenience, gas, ATM withdrawals and the like. So that excites us quite nicely. 
In the quarter as well, we released 2 days early or up to 2-day early deposit, which means that if you're a Dayforce Wallet user, you can get paid when you want and say you take out 1/3 of your net earnings during the period, you'll remaining 2/3, you can get up to 2 days early as well. And again, the whole model is predicated on no direct fees to the employees, no membership fees, no fees to the organization. And every payment is a true payroll, which means it's fully compliant to get an earnings slip for every type of transfer. 
The streaming of pay will come online, as we mentioned, in 2022. We believe that will obviously accelerate because the idea over there is instead of doing an on-demand pay or having to wait for direct deposit as I work the pay automatically strains into my wallet, and we're talking about making access to your earnings completely instantaneous, and that will obviously be paired with quite a very rich financial wellness offering set with inside the actual product. So we are quite excited with it. 
Dayforce wallet, by the way, also has given us a tremendous advantage in market. We are still seeing attachment rates across new business well across 80%. And in every conversation that I have with clients, with early clients, the Dayforce wallet is top of mind."

We do also compete, as you know, against the more traditional human capital management and payroll customers. And obviously, our win rates over there are quite nicely.

I always spoke about the technology, having 3 sequential steps of delivery. The first step was to build out the continuous engine that would allow us to calculate net earnings as someone worked. And that's obviously quite a difficult thing to do, and we believe we have quite a competitive merger around us in that we can do that and the others can't. 
The second step was creating the payment rails, so that not only would we calculate net earnings in real time, but we could also pay people in real time, and that came down to the Dayforce wallet, and we've seen great traction. The third part was, well, if I download the Dayforce wallet, and we know who you are, the KYC process. We know you have the right to work. We know what your certifications are. We know that you're a safe person. We also know inside the Dayforce application, what all the local jurisdictional rules are for things like overtime, minimum wages, premium pay and the like. And we also have the capability through the Dayforce app to allow you to clock in and clock out via geo locations. 
In that case, what we can do is we can make it very easy for organizations to publish their vacancies. And a vacancy could be a number of hours, say, a shift that has to be worked. It could be a task such as a delivery or could be a longer-term assignment, say, a 3-, 4-week program in this time. And along with the vacancy, the organization could publish the competencies required and possibly even some learning management contract. We can then allow all of the Dayforce Wallet users to look at their app and much like they'll be looking for awards around them, they'll be able to see the vacancies for which they have the right competencies. They could learn about the vacancy through the learning management content, apply, get matched and when they actually show up, they would show a QR code to clock in and clock out. And as soon as their hours were approved, they would actually get paid. And as Ceridian would be responsible for doing all the necessary remittances. We're doing all of the year-end filings, all of the different types of money movement. And you would go now from just not only having instant access to your earnings, but you'd have the ability to actually find work and get paid in real time, which we believe matches where the workforce is going. 
So we're quite excited with that opportunity. We've started the actual research and the build-out and the partnerships that I think will enable us to do that. Obviously, leveraging the great stuff that we already have through the Dayforce continuous calculation engine the Dayforce Wallet payment rails."

And as we've always said, that KPI needs to be measured measurable and convertible into a money saving. For us, we use the term quantifiable value, and I believe we're ranked #1 in industry in terms of delivering strong ROI. 
When we talk about the Dayforce Wallet, we talk about some very strong metrics that show basically the decrease in attrition rates. The decrease in the first 90-day attrition rates, the quicker time to actually hire someone. So as we actually build it out, it's always along the same lines. 
In terms of the talent intelligence, what we would say today is the market operates in something called Talent 1.0. And at a high level, it's really people operating this list management framework. If I'm recruiting, I look at a list of candidates for a particular job requisition. I sought or I filter that list accordingly. I find the candidate that I'd like to act on, and then I go through a number of sequential steps usually manually driven. 
In Talent 2.0 that we're beginning to release now, we're moving more to a recommendation and prediction type of model, very similar to, for instance, when you go to Amazon or Netflix and those systems recommend either products that you would like or movie shows or TV shows that meet your requirements. We're doing the same now on the talent side. When I go to that list of candidates, it's not a list, but a set of recommended candidates that the system has predicted will be a good match based on who the hiring manager is and who the recruiter. And then even once we have that, we can go and use a lot of automation like align the candidate to self-schedule, when the candidate interacts with the system, we can engage with bot technology. So if the candidate is applying for 1 particular type of job based on the candidate who is applying and the available job requisitions, we can recommend back to the candidate where they may be a good fit for other opportunities, and at that point in time, get them to engage and or even complete the application for them. So it's effectively using ML models and AI models to go and look at what's been done currently in talent in order to engage with people in a much more natural manner that they would typically expect. 
In terms of the service desk over there, there's a lot of information that the Dayforce system has. As you know, we've already moved into natural workspaces, you can now engage with the system through Teams or through Slack in a very natural way. We can now allow the employee to ask questions about policy. What is the vacation policy as opposed to just how many days do I have? Am I eligible for something? And by doing that, we can take a lot of load off the HR department. And again, given that's driven off of ML type of model continually evolves, continually learns and becomes more of a natural way of interacting with the system. So obviously, a lot of excitement in order to get around intelligence and data. 
If you do come to the Ceridian World Tour, which you, obviously, came in Vegas, before others, you'll see Joe talk about that, and we actually have a few demonstrations of the technology, which is really exciting."

So it's a tremendous benefit to both the organization and to their employees. In fact, an organization could go from a weekly or biweekly payroll to a monthly payroll and get a onetime lift of working capital as well. They wanted additional benefit. So I think that's becoming very important. The second is what I would say is that the desire to get paid immediately is becoming a requirement in business today. It's no longer optional. So the economy is moving there, and we have better tech than I think anyone else in the market in that every time we move the money, we do a true payroll that is fully compliant at a federal on the state or provincial basis in Canada. And I think that's very, very strong as well. When we're going to some deals, we actually are seeing them very focused on the Dayforce Wallet. There have been in some cases where that has allowed us to maintain or actually increase pricing just based on the advantage that we have inside the market. And the last piece as well is that I do believe it does help our brand with the employees of our customers. And so I would expect over time that we become the preferred choice of HCM solution, not only for the organizations, but for the worker as well."

What we're actually seeing is the 80-day spending from the cards. And as we mentioned, there's about 25 transactions per month, they average probably about $30 per transaction, usually on day-to-day living. When someone does an ACH transfer which, again, we don't see much of that, there isn't any fee to the actual employee. Next year, we will move into what they call OCT transfers or instant transfers. And over there, there is an ability to charge for that. Usually, it is 50 basis points up to a small cap that discharge for that particular type of transfer. What we are seeing in terms of the usage of the wallet is becoming quite disruptive to the credit card industry. So instead of using the credit card, we're seeing a lot of the employees are now using the Dayforce card instead. In that way, there obviously are more on top of their finances and they don't get into a situation where they are paying the 22% on the balance of the actual statement at the end of the month. There's a big benefit from them. In terms of additional revenue opportunities, as we move into next year, we start moving into things like rewards and we'll probably move into the areas like buy now, pay later. And all of those types of opportunities address the ability to increase our take rate. For example, on the rewards, we would expect to get about 90 basis points on the actual spend for that particular type of item that was covered by the reward on buy now, pay later basis, there would obviously be a revenue share with the partner over there."

Typically, you always have the Q4 as being the biggest quarter because in the U.S., customers want to avoid the first quarter reconciliation. So the Q4, we're expecting obviously a very healthy go-live. Quite honestly, internally, we track it at a dollar value of go-lives. So we look at their cap on go-live in the quarter, we don't really focus on the actual number. The other part about that, the number isn't really what I'd call a pure number because when you have a customer that goes live in a different country, if they have contracted through a different type of entity it could be viewed as from finance as a go-live second go-live, whereas, from STEM perspective, we would actually view it as 1 system. So again, I would encourage you to look at the LTM basis more than anything else. I wouldn't read too much into it."

That obviously will have impact on manufacturing customers with inside North America. The second area we're quite focused is in on EMEA. We've got a very good presence, as you know, in U.K. and Ireland. I've seen really tremendous traction in Germany, and we're launching the native payroll solution for Germany next year as well, and we're seeing quite a lot of interest in that. Once we have Germany, we, obviously, are going to expand into the other [indiscernible] countries surrounding Germany to get a road of footprint across EMEA. 
The third area, as you pointed out, is across APJ. Obviously, the reason we're doing that is that we do have a lot of what we call bureau customers, so customers through the acquisitions of Ascender and Excelity and RITEQ. And as we build out the native capabilities for those regions, that gives us an opportunity to go back to the base and not only move their payroll onto Dayforce, but also add on things like time and attendance, workforce management, core HR and all of the talent modules, which obviously is a very large revenue opportunity for us. 
Also within APJ, we've got quite well kind of integrated go-to-market. So we have sales and marketing across the region, a big presence across areas like Singapore, A&D and other areas across. We also have service and implementation capabilities in market, which means we can get to market quite quickly. And as we move into 2022, you'll start to see us focus more on what we call the migration and the upsell of the incumbent base, which is about 1,500 customers in region.
