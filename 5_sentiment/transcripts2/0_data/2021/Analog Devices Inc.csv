So I'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insight into how we are shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future. In the first quarter, we delivered strong results",1476,"Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. So I'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insight into how we are shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future. 
In the first quarter, we delivered strong results that came in at the high end of our outlook. Revenue was $1.56 billion and increased 20% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based with growth across all end markets, highlighted by a record quarter for our industrial business. We delivered gross margin of 70% and up margin of nearly 41%. All told, we produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.44. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 33% free cash flow margin, placing us in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very pleased with our team's performance this quarter. 
Now I'd like to discuss how we are advancing our mission of engineering good for the planet, social health and economic prosperity, which in turn, will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Awareness of the world's environmental degradation and climate change specifically is growing tremendously with a global call to action building momentum. Semiconductors as the bedrock of the modern digital economy have a major role to play in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. 
At ADI, our technology sits at the intersection of our customers and society's most pressing challenges, and we're uniquely positioned to drive positive impact. Our industry-leading portfolio, with its breadth of capabilities, defines the edge of performance and inherently deliver sustainable benefits. With each generation of chip design, we increase efficiency while enhancing the performance of our customer systems. This portfolio supports customers of all sizes and spans industries that are aligned with key secular trends. So today, I'll focus on where ADI is engineering good across the automation electrification and connectivity sectors. 
Firstly, the automation of human routines, factory floors and supply chains is critical to our future, and the pandemic has further accelerated this paradigm. The World Economic Forum is predicting that by 2025, over half of all tasks will be performed by machines, a first-in-human history. To support this trend, our industrial customer base is boosting deployments of robots and cobots. Over the next 5 years, the global robot installed base is expected to increase by about 60%. With industrial motors currently consuming 25% of all the world's electricity, we urgently need to deploy technologies that not only deliver speed and accuracy, safety and flexibility, but also energy savings. 
Now let me share a few examples of how our technologies are meeting these challenges in automation. So firstly, variable speed drives can reduce motor energy consumption by up to 40% in a robot. Our precision signal chain, isolation and power management technologies together increase response time and improve power conversion. Secondly, our time-of-flight sensing technology allows robots to sense and interpret the world around them, so our customers can deploy more robots per square foot and improve worker safety. Thirdly, we our OtoSense condition-based monitoring solution recently identifies motor inefficiencies, enabling customers to proactively optimize and repair machinery. This avoids costly downtime and lowers energy consumption by 10%. 
Importantly, these technologies that improve motor efficiency and robotic control can save almost 1 gigaton of annual CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 330 million residential homes. In total, automation is a key component of our industrial business, supporting tens of thousands of customers. We expect this accelerated digitalization to drive continued growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn to electrification and discuss the important role ADI is playing as consumer demand for greener transportation accelerates. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 215 million electric vehicles on the road, up exponentially from about 7 million today. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of the electric vehicle journey, from supporting EV infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. So I'll share now how our technologies are impacting this ecosystem. 
First, the shift to renewable energy sources drives great environmental benefits, but also creates new obstacles in distribution, transmission and stability. This requires a smart grid, which can digitally monitor and adjust performance. Our control and sensing technologies are critical to ensuring the grid parameters remain stable and prevent shutdowns. This shift also requires energy storage systems to mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. Here, our high accuracy monitoring and efficient power conversion technologies help extend systems battery life by more than 30%. 
Turning to the battery, which is the most expensive vehicle part. Our battery management system, or BMS, enables up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. As the market leader, over half of the top 10 electric vehicle brands is ADI's BMS technology today. In addition, last fall, we introduced the industry's first wireless BMS platform. This is all the benefits of our wired solution by lowering vehicle weight and enabling a scalable battery architecture, paving the way for reuse in storage systems. 
GM's Ultium platform uses our wireless BMS technology, which is expected to be deployed across 30 different models by 2025. Interest in our wireless BMS technology is rising. And last quarter, we recorded our second OEM design win. Importantly, the environmental impact from our BMS capabilities is notable. In 2020 alone, vehicles equipped with ADI's BMS technologies prevented approximately 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Our solutions utilized at the battery formation stage enable more current density, thereby shrinking our customers' equipment footprint by up to 4x and reducing per channel costs by nearly half. 
Our technology makes it possible for factories to recycle more than 80% of the energy used during the formation back into the power grid. Based on today's production levels, energy recycling during formation reduces CO2 output by about 1 million tonnes annually. So all told, electrification not only represents a highly valuable market with long-term revenue growth opportunities, but one that will be critical to the preservation of our precious natural ecosystem. 
So finally, let me turn to connectivity. In the face of the pandemic, connectivity has been the foundation that is sustaining and powering our society and the economy. And while the communications market is not known historically for its sustainability benefits, this ability to stay connected and productive from anywhere has also had a positive impact on the environment. A clear proof point is the reduction of global carbon emissions by a record 7% in 2020. By 2030, forecasts suggest mobile traffic will increase by about 17x. This exponential increase in wireless data, combined with pervasive cloud computing, puts IP traffic on pace to double every 2.5 years. And ADI is playing a critical role in building out the next-generation infrastructure to support this exponential increase in data. From capturing the signal at the base station air interface to transferring the information to the data center while substantially decreasing power. 
So ADI has invested ahead and reshaped the 5G radio architecture, our software-defined transceivers with complementary precision signal chain and power technologies are vital to enabling the 5G massive MIMO architecture. When comparing 5G to 4G, our solutions helped deliver a 90% decrease in energy per bit at the air interface by decreasing the channel count by 10x, while maintaining the radio size and thermal performance. With the exponential upswing in data generation, our customers are upgrading their optical infrastructure from 100 to 400 gigabits per second. Our precision signal chain technologies help enable these optical modules maintain constant power, while operating at 4x the data rate. And with the customers looking to increase to 1 terabit and beyond, ADI's opportunity will continue to expand. 
Capturing and transporting data efficiently is important, but computing and data centers is the primary source of energy consumption in the connectivity ecosystem. Currently, data centers generate more than 130 million tonnes of CO2 per year globally. So this is where the transition from 12 to 48-volt power distribution can reduce power loss and increase compute density. Our 48-volt [ decor ] micromodules, power and power system monitoring solutions are enabling this transition. And according to Alphabet, this approach can improve data center energy efficiency by 30%. All told, ADI is part of the ecosystem, enabling greater efficiency in wireless and wire data capture, transmission and, of course, computing and our solutions help customers to scale their investments and build next-generation networks economically and resourceful. 
So stepping back, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and our mission to Engineer Good, but a lot remains yet to be done. We're focused on partnering with our customers to develop increasingly innovative technologies that create successful business outcomes, enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world. 
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

ADI delivered a",894,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. 
ADI delivered a strong first quarter with results at the high end of our outlook. Revenue increased 20%, nearing an all-time high; operating margin expanded to 40.7%, in line with our long-term model; and adjusted EPS grew 40%. We saw tremendous breadth this quarter with all market segments growing year-over-year, the first time in over 3 years, and B2B revenue increased 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, with double-digit growth across each end market. 
Industrial represented 55% of revenue during the quarter, increased 5% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. This represented a record quarter for industrial with broad-based strength across applications, customers and geographies. Specifically, demand across our Automation Instrumentation and Energy businesses accelerated this quarter. Communications, which represented 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 10% sequentially, but increased 16% year-over-year. Both Wireless and Wireline revenue grew double digits despite 0 revenue from Huawei this quarter. 
Automotive, which represented 16% of revenue, increased 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. With the industry aggressively ramping up production, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all applications. BMS exhibited the highest growth, a trend we expect to continue given our growing design pipeline. And lastly, Consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, increased 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in hearables, wearables and home entertainment. This quarter's inflection puts us on track to return to full year growth in 2021. 
And now for the rest of the P&L, gross margin, which is seasonally weaker in the first quarter, finished flat sequentially at 70%. We anticipate our first quarter's gross margin will be the trough for the year as we benefit from a strong top line, improving utilization and capturing the majority of the LTC cost savings. OpEx in the quarter was $456 million, up sequentially and year-over-year due mainly to variable compensation. Op margins finished at 40.7%, above the guided midpoint, non-op expenses were $27 million and better than our outlook due to an investment gain. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. So all told, adjusted EPS came in above the high end of guidance at $1.44. This included a $0.04 benefit from an investment gain that was not in our prior outlook. 
Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars increased modestly, while inventory days finished at 119, down from 121 in the fourth quarter. Channel inventory, as measured in weeks, was flat sequentially and remained well below our 7 to 8-week target. CapEx in the quarter increased to $67 million or roughly 4% of sales. We are working judiciously to add CapEx to meet this record demand and anticipate that CapEx will run slightly above our long-term target of 4% for fiscal 2021. 
Turning to cash flow, over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion or 33% of revenue. You'll recall that during the last year, we paused our share repurchase program for a few quarters due to the pandemic and our proposed Maxim acquisition. Therefore, in 2020, we returned 80% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. This quarter, we've reinstated our share repurchase program and given our current [ 1.5 ] leverage ratio, we're committed to returning 100% of free cash flow for the year. Looking at the first quarter, we executed nearly $160 million of repo and we also announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend at $0.69 per share, which marks our 18th increase over the last 17 years. 
Before moving on to guidance, I want to provide some context on the current state of supply. A sharper than expected recovery in the economy, coupled with a lean inventory backdrop, is fueling unprecedented demand for semiconductors and putting stress on the global supply chain. While the industry at large is aggressively working to meet this historic demand, it's more than likely we will be operating in a constrained supply environment for the balance of the year. At ADI, we're confident in our ability to outperform in times like this. Our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, healthy balance sheet inventory and diversified product and customer base position us well. In addition, we're working to secure additional capacity from our external partners and ramping our internal operations to increase output. 
Now let me provide our second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.6 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects what would be record revenue. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth for automotive, industrial and consumer markets, but we do see a decline in our comps. Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be 41%, plus or minus 70 bps and our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS will be $1.44, plus or minus $0.08. 
So in summary, I'm encouraged by the near-term trends we're seeing across our end markets. And while we're mindful of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway. And with Maxim expected to close this summer, 2021 will be a transformative year for ADI. 
Let me now pass it back to Mike to start our Q&A."

Prashanth, I just want to talk a little bit about how the model unfolds from here. I mean, clearly, you talked about already hitting the gross margin trough for the year, but you're guiding EPS sort of flattish on up revenue.

So the way to think about OpEx is that if you recall in the proxy, we identified that last year, in the first half, we had a particularly low bonus payout as a reflection of the macroeconomic environment. In the first half of this year, you're going to see the opposite effect of that. So on average, it's a normal bonus payout, but you do see a significant upswing in our variable comps for -- which is impacting both the first and the second quarter compares. In addition, we have the merit increase, that if you remember, we put that merit increase in several months later than normal as a result of the pandemic last year. So you're beginning to see that on a full year run rate basis in first quarter and then it will carry into second quarter. 
So beyond these comp related items, OpEx is really at a steady level. We are not requiring any additional investment at the OpEx level to support the demand that we're generating."

So we are producing and shipping at record levels, and second quarter outlook is going to be a record. We have enough capacity to meet the guide, but additional -- significant additional upside versus that guide will depend on what we're able to procure both from an external wafer standpoint as well as the capital that we are in the process of deploying into our internal facilities to support that. 
What we're doing to help alleviate that situation is we have been consistently building inventory since last summer to deplete what was pulled down during the pandemic shutdowns. We are adding additional supply, both internally, and I mentioned the capital that we're deploying, which is mostly going to the back end and then externally, we've gone out and acquired additional wafers from our partners. So the -- I think the answer to your question on CapEx is that it's mostly for test. And then on the capacity side, where we can get additional capacity from our partners, we're doing that. But even with this additional capacity, it's very likely that the strength of demand is going to outplace -- outpace supply for some period of time. So I think we will be chasing demand at least through the balance of this year. 
From a capital deployment standpoint, some of that -- as we guide as a percentage of revenue, some of that is dependent on how strong the year continues to roll out. So when I say slightly above 4%, it could come down to 4% or maybe just a hair below if revenue continues to clip along here."

So while we see some hotspots, we're really talking about is a few weeks of extension in different places. 
I would remind you, too, that we run this company, we run our manufacturing plans, the operating plans are run to POS rather than POA. So what we're seeing right now is a good balance between POS and POA. But as Prashanth said, we're preparing for quite a bit of upside during this year, and we've pretty substantially increased the CapEx in our back end."

What we have seen is a bit more of a slowdown in China as they're digesting kind of the 5G that they've deployed and the channel counts are a bit lower. So we do think Comms troughs in second quarter and then begins to pick up in the second half with the global 5G. 
In terms of our view on whether we can grow Comms on a year-over-year basis, given the significant headwind we have from Huawei going to 0, that's a tough ask."

But I won't stress, there's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. And I don't want to get into the business of making strong speculative predictions here, but we can only kind of guide one quarter at a time, particularly in this [ derating ] market. 
But if I look at the markets and just kind of peel the story back a little bit for you. So our Industrial business, which represents about half of the company's revenue, was down. We had 2 consecutive down years in '19 and '20. But we produced a record quarter in the first. We expect ongoing strength in that business. And one thing I'm very, very pleased about is that the most diverse part of our Industrial business is automation. And I think given the strength of our opportunity pipeline, the new products we've got coming to market, I expect to see a multiyear tailwind in the automation part. 
I think right now, there's -- in automotive, there's a big push to electric vehicles. And I see that, as I said in the prepared remarks, that is expected to grow by 2030 from kind of 7 million deployed electric vehicles today to over 200 million by 2030. And we talked about the last quarter about the strength of our Cabin Electronics business, active noise cancellation, [indiscernible] module, our A to B bus deployments and all that, too, provides good tailwinds for the company going ahead. 
Comms, as we've just narrated, weakened the first half of '21. But really, I think that's about the timing of deployments. And my expectation is that, that business will snap back in the second half of '21 and continue into '22. Last but not least, our Consumer business has shown a couple of sequential growth quarters. And we no longer have the overhang of 1 big socket and 1 big customer. So with the diversity of our business, we've -- we're addressing more applications. We have a stronger product portfolio than we had, say, 3 years ago. I think we're on a growth track in that business, and we're certainly off to a very, very good start. So we believe that [ '20 ] was the bottom of that business. And certainly, the signals are -- that is the case."

So we're certainly keeping ahead. Our investments are keeping ahead of these revenue levels, obviously. 
Like most of our peers in the industry, there are supply constraints and parts of the business. So we're not able to meet all the demand, particularly in auto, which has been very, very well publicized. And the constraints continue across the front end in wafer procurement and also the back end.  But I will remind you, too, we produce about half our silicon and side ADI and the other half we procure with external partners. 
So I think something else worth noting is that we've been building inventory since last summer in terms of die stock and finished goods, which was heavily depleted during the pandemic shutdown. So as I said internally, we're ramping up our own manufacturing operations, and we've been successful in acquiring additional wafers from our external partners. So I think that's the best I can give you in terms of the atmosphere that we're working within. We're certainly keeping CapEx deployments ahead of where we think the revenue could be this year based on the demand patterns we now see."

In automotive, we're strongly attaching to our infotainment business, the autonomous radar systems. And the strongest surge in terms of growth in industrial for the LT portfolio, the additional cross-selling is instrumentation test and micromodules, generally speaking, across the board, we're seeing very, very strong demand for those products.

So I'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insight into how we are shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future.  
The first quarter, we delivered strong results that came in at the high end of our outlook. Revenue was $1.56 billion and increased 20% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based with growth across all end markets, highlighted by a record quarter for our industrial business. We delivered gross margin of 70% and up margin of nearly 41%. All told, we produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.44. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 33% free cash flow margin, placing us in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very pleased with our team's performance this quarter.  
Now I'd like to discuss how we are advancing our mission of engineering good for the planet, social health and economic prosperity, which in turn will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Awareness of the world's environmental degradation and climate change specifically is growing tremendously with a global call to action building momentum. Semiconductors as the bedrock of the modern digital economy have a major role to play in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. At ADI, our technology sit at the intersection of our customers and society's most pressing challenges, and we're uniquely positioned to drive positive impact. 
Our industry-leading portfolio, with its breadth of capabilities, defines the edge of performance and inherently delivers sustainable benefits. With each generation of chip design, we increase efficiency while enhancing the performance of our customer systems. This portfolio supports customers of all sizes and spans industries that are aligned with key secular trends. So today, I'll focus on where ADI's Engineering Good across the automation, electrification and connectivity sectors.  
Firstly, the automation of human routines. Factory floors and supply chains is critical to our future, and the pandemic has further accelerated this paradigm. The World Economic Forum is predicting that by 2025, over half of all tasks will be performed by machines, a first in human history. To support this trend, our industrial customer base is boosting deployments of robots and cobots. Over the next 5 years, the global robot installed base is expected to increase by about 60%. With industrial motors currently consuming 25% of all the world's electricity, we urgently need to deploy technologies that not only deliver speed and accuracy, safety and flexibility, but also energy savings. 
Now let me share a few examples of how our technologies are meeting these challenges in automation. So firstly, variable speed drives can reduce motor energy consumption by up to 40% in a robot. Our precision signal chain, isolation and power management technologies together increase response time and improve power conversion. Secondly, our time-of-flight sensing technology allows robots to sense and interpret the world around them, so our customers can deploy more robots per square foot and improve worker safety. Thirdly, our OtoSense condition-based monitoring solution presently identifies motor inefficiencies, enabling customers to proactively optimize and repair machinery. This avoids costly downtime and lowers energy consumption by 10%. 
Importantly, these technologies that improve motor efficiency and robotic control can save almost 1 gigaton of annual CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 330 million residential homes. In total, automation is a key component of our industrial business, supporting tens of thousands of customers. We expect this accelerated digitalization to drive continued growth in 2021 and beyond.  
Now I'll turn to electrification and discuss the important role ADI is playing as consumer demand for greener transportation accelerates. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 215 million electric vehicles on the road, up exponentially from about 7 million today. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of the electric vehicle journey, from supporting EV infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. 
So I'll share now how our technologies are impacting this ecosystem. First, the shift to renewable energy sources drives great environmental benefits, but also creates new obstacles in distribution, transmission and stability. This requires the smart grid, which can digitally monitor and adjust performance. Our control and sensing technologies are critical to ensuring the grid parameters remain stable and prevent shutdowns. This shift also requires energy storage systems to mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. Here, our high accuracy monitoring and efficient power conversion technologies help extend systems battery life by more than 30%.  
Turning to the battery, which is the most expensive vehicle part. Our battery management system, or BMS, enables up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. As the market leader, over half of the top 10 electric vehicle brands is ADI's BMS technology today. In addition, last fall, we introduced the industry's first wireless BMS platform. This is all the benefits of our wired solution by lowering vehicle weight and enabling a scalable battery architecture, paving the way for reuse in storage systems. 
GM's Ultium platform uses our wireless BMS technology, which is expected to be deployed across 30 different models by 2025. Interests in our wireless BMS technology is rising. And last quarter, we recorded our second OEM design win. Importantly, the environmental impact from our BMS capabilities is notable. In 2020 alone, vehicles equipped with ADI's BMS technologies prevented approximately 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Our solutions utilized at the battery formation stage enable more current density, thereby shrinking our customers' equipment footprint by up to 4x and reducing per channel costs by nearly half.  
Our technology makes it possible for factories to recycle more than 80% of the energy used during the formation back into the power grid. Based on today's production levels, energy recycling during formation reduces CO2 output by about 1 million tonnes annually. So all told, electrification not only represents a highly valuable market with long-term revenue growth opportunities, but one that will be critical to the preservation of our precious natural ecosystem.  
So finally, let me turn to connectivity. In the face of the pandemic, connectivity has been the foundation that is sustaining and powering our society and the economy. And while the communications market is not known historically for its sustainability benefits, this ability to stay connected and productive from anywhere has also had a positive impact on the environment. A clear proof point is the reduction of global carbon emissions by a record 7% in 2020. 
By 2030, forecasts suggest mobile traffic will increase by about 17-fold. This exponential increase in wireless data, combined with pervasive cloud computing, puts IP traffic on pace to double every 2.5 years. And ADI is playing a critical role in building out the next-generation infrastructure to support this exponential increase in data, from capturing the signal at the base station air interface to transferring the information to the data center while substantially decreasing power.  
So ADI has invested ahead and reshaped the 5G radio architecture, our software-defined transceivers with complementary precision signal chain and power technologies are vital to enabling the 5G massive MIMO architecture. When comparing 5G to 4G, our solutions help deliver a 90% decrease in energy per bit at the air interface by decreasing the channel count by 10x, while maintaining the radio size and thermal performance. With the exponential upswing in data generation, our customers are upgrading their optical infrastructure from 100 to 400 gigabits per second. Our precision signal chain technologies help enable these optical modules maintain constant power, while operating at 4x the data rate. And with the customers looking to increase to 1 terabit and beyond, ADI's opportunity will continue to expand.  
Capturing and transporting data efficiently is important, but computing and data centers is the primary source of energy consumption in the connectivity ecosystem. Currently, data centers generate more than 130 million tonnes of CO2 per year globally. So this is where the transition from 12 to 48-volt power distribution can reduce power loss and increase compute density. Our 48-volt core micromodules, power and power system monitoring solutions are enabling this transition. And according to Alphabet, this approach can improve data center energy efficiency by 30%. All told, ADI is part of the ecosystem, enabling greater efficiency in wireless and wire data capture, transmission and, of course, computing. And our solutions help customers to scale their investments and build next-generation networks economically and resourcefully.  
So stepping back, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and our mission to Engineer Good, but a lot remains yet to be done. We're focused on partnering with our customers to develop increasingly innovative technologies that create successful business outcomes, enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world.  
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.ADI delivered a",892,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a strong first quarter with results at the high end of our outlook. Revenue increased 20%, nearing an all-time high; operating margin expanded to 40.7%, in line with our long-term model; and adjusted EPS grew 40%. We saw tremendous breadth this quarter with all market segments growing year-over-year, the first time in over 3 years, and B2B revenue increased 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, with double-digit growth across each end market.  
Industrial represented 55% of revenue during the quarter, increased 5% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. This represented a record quarter for industrial with broad-based strength across applications, customers and geographies. Specifically, demand across our automation, instrumentation and energy businesses accelerated this quarter. 
Communications, which represented 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 10% sequentially, but increased 16% year-over-year. Both wireless and wireline revenue grew double digits despite 0 revenue from Huawei this quarter. 
Automotive, which represented 16% of revenue, increased 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. With the industry aggressively ramping up production, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all applications. BMS exhibited the highest growth, a trend we expect to continue given our growing design pipeline. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, increased 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in hearables, wearables and home entertainment. This quarter's inflection puts us on track to return to full year growth in 2021.  
And now for the rest of the P&L. Gross margin, which is seasonally weaker in the first quarter, finished flat sequentially at 70%. We anticipate our first quarter's gross margin will be the trough for the year as we benefit from a strong top line, improving utilization and capturing the majority of the LTC cost savings. OpEx in the quarter was $456 million, up sequentially and year-over-year due mainly to variable compensation. Op margins finished at 40.7%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $27 million and better than our outlook due to an investment gain. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. So all told, adjusted EPS came in above the high end of guidance at $1.44. This included a $0.04 benefit from an investment gain that was not in our prior outlook.  
Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars increased modestly, while inventory days finished at 119, down from 121 in the fourth quarter. Channel inventory, as measured in weeks, was flat sequentially and remained well below our 7 to 8-week target. CapEx in the quarter increased to $67 million or roughly 4% of sales. We are working judiciously to add CapEx to meet this record demand and anticipate that CapEx will run slightly above our long-term target of 4% for fiscal 2021.  
Turning to cash flow, over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion or 33% of revenue. You'll recall that during the last year, we paused our share repurchase program for a few quarters due to the pandemic and our proposed Maxim acquisition. Therefore, in 2020, we returned 80% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. This quarter, we've reinstated our share repurchase program, and given our current 1.5 leverage ratio, we're committed to returning 100% of free cash flow for the year.  
Looking at the first quarter, we executed nearly $160 million of repo, and we also announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend at $0.69 per share, which marks our 18th increase over the last 17 years.  
Before moving on to guidance, I want to provide some context on the current state of supply. A sharper than expected recovery in the economy, coupled with a lean inventory backdrop, is fueling unprecedented demand for semiconductors and putting stress on the global supply chain. While the industry at large is aggressively working to meet this historic demand, it's more than likely we will be operating in a constrained supply environment for the balance of the year. At ADI, we're confident in our ability to outperform in times like this. Our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, healthy balance sheet inventory and diversified product and customer base position us well. In addition, we're working to secure additional capacity from our external partners and ramping our internal operations to increase output.
Now let me provide our second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.6 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects what would be record revenue. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth for automotive, industrial and consumer markets, but we do see a decline in our comps. Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be 41%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS will be $1.44, plus or minus $0.08. 
So in summary, I'm encouraged by the near-term trends we're seeing across our end markets. And while we're mindful of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway. And with Maxim expected to close this summer, 2021 will be a transformative year for ADI. 
Let me now pass it back to Mike to start our Q&A."

Prashanth, I just want to talk a little bit about how the model unfolds from here. I mean clearly, you talked about already hitting the gross margin trough for the year, but you're guiding EPS sort of flattish on up revenue. I'm just kind of curious, how should we be thinking about OpEx from current run rate levels? And specifically, is there incremental OpEx needed because of the tight supply situation? Or what are the puts and takes as we go throughout the balance of the year?"

So the way to think about OpEx is that if you recall in the proxy, we identified that last year, in the first half, we had a particularly low bonus payout as a reflection of the macroeconomic environment. In the first half of this year, you're going to see the opposite effect of that. So on average, it's a normal bonus payout, but you do see a significant upswing in our variable comps for -- which is impacting both the first and the second quarter compares. In addition, we have the merit increase, that if you remember, we put that merit increase in several months later than normal as a result of the pandemic last year. So you're beginning to see that on a full year run rate basis in first quarter and then it will carry into second quarter. 
So beyond these comp-related items, OpEx is really at a steady level. We are not requiring any additional investment at the OpEx level to support the demand that we're generating."

So we are producing and shipping at record levels, and second quarter outlook is going to be a record. We have enough capacity to meet the guide, but additional -- significant additional upside versus that guide will depend on what we're able to procure both from an external wafer standpoint as well as the capital that we are in the process of deploying into our internal facilities to support that. 
What we're doing to help alleviate that situation is we have been consistently building inventory since last summer to deplete what was pulled down during the pandemic shutdowns. We are adding additional supply, both internally, and I mentioned the capital that we're deploying, which is mostly going to the back end. And then externally, we've gone out and acquired additional wafers from our partners. 
So the -- I think the answer to your question on CapEx is that it's mostly for test. And then on the capacity side, where we can get additional capacity from our partners, we're doing that. But even with this additional capacity, it's very likely that the strength of demand is going to outplace -- outpace supply for some period of time. So I think we will be chasing demand at least through the balance of this year.
From a capital deployment standpoint, some of that -- as we guide as a percentage of revenue, some of that is dependent on how strong the year continues to roll out. So when I say slightly above 4%, it could come down to -- or maybe just a hair below if revenue continues to clip along here."

So we entered our first quarter with what we would have called normal lead times. But during the quarter and into the early part of this quarter, we've seen lead times extend, which I think is pretty consistent with the industry at large. So while we see some hotspots, we're really talking about is a few weeks of extension in different places. 
I would remind you, too, that we run this company -- we run our manufacturing plans, the operating plans are run to POS rather than POA. So what we're seeing right now is a good balance between POS and POA. But as Prashanth said, we're preparing for quite a bit of upside during this year, and we've pretty substantially increased the CapEx in our back end."

What we have seen is a bit more of a slowdown in China as they're digesting kind of the 5G that they've deployed and the channel counts are a bit lower. So we do think comms troughs in second quarter and then begins to pick up in the second half with the global 5G. 
In terms of our view on whether we can grow comms on a year-over-year basis, given the significant headwind we have from Huawei going to 0, that's a tough ask."

But if I look at the markets and just kind of peel the story back a little bit for you. So our industrial business, which represents about half of the company's revenue, was down. We had 2 consecutive down years in '19 and '20. But we produced a record quarter in the first. We expect ongoing strength in that business. And one thing I'm very, very pleased about is that the most diverse part of our industrial business is automation.

And we talked a lot the last quarter about the strength of our cabin electronics business, active noise cancellation, [indiscernible] audio, our A2B bus deployments and all that, too, provides good tailwinds for the company going ahead. 
Comms, as we've just narrated, weakened the first half of '21. But really, I think that's about the timing of deployments. And my expectation is that, that business will snap back in the second half of '21 and continue into '22. 
Last but not least, our consumer business has shown a couple of sequential growth quarters. And we no longer have the overhang of 1 big socket and 1 big customer. So with the diversity of our business, we've -- we're addressing more applications. We have a stronger product portfolio than we had, say, 3 years ago. I think we're on a growth track in that business, and we're certainly off to a very, very good start. So we believe that '20 was the bottom of that business. And certainly, the signals are that is the case."

So we're certainly keeping ahead. Our investments are keeping ahead of these revenue levels, obviously.
Like most of our peers in the industry, there are supply constraints in parts of the business. So we're not able to meet all the demand, particularly in auto, which has been very, very well publicized. And the constraints continue across the front end in wafer procurement and also the back end. But I will remind you, too, we produce about half our silicon inside ADI and the other half we procure with external partners.
So I think something else worth noting is that we've been building inventory since last summer in terms of die stock and finished goods, which was heavily depleted during the pandemic shutdown. So as I said internally, we're ramping up our own manufacturing operations, and we've been successful in acquiring additional wafers from our external partners. So I think that's the best I can give you in terms of the atmosphere that we're working within. We're certainly keeping CapEx deployments ahead of where we think the revenue could be this year based on the demand patterns we now see."

So I'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insight into how we are shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future.  
The first quarter, we delivered strong results that came in at the high end of our outlook. Revenue was $1.56 billion and increased 20% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based with growth across all end markets, highlighted by a record quarter for our industrial business. We delivered gross margin of 70% and op margin of nearly 41%. All told, we produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.44. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 33% free cash flow margin, placing us in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very pleased with our team's performance this quarter.  
Now I'd like to discuss how we are advancing our mission of engineering good for the planet, social health and economic prosperity, which in turn will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Awareness of the world's environmental degradation and climate change specifically is growing tremendously with a global call to action building momentum. Semiconductors as the bedrock of the modern digital economy have a major role to play in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. At ADI, our technology sit at the intersection of our customers and society's most pressing challenges, and we're uniquely positioned to drive positive impact. 
Our industry-leading portfolio, with its breadth of capabilities, defines the edge of performance and inherently delivers sustainable benefits. With each generation of chip design, we increase efficiency while enhancing the performance of our customer systems. This portfolio supports customers of all sizes and spans industries that are aligned with key secular trends. So today, I'll focus on where ADI's Engineering Good across the automation, electrification and connectivity sectors.  
Firstly, the automation of human routines. Factory floors and supply chains is critical to our future, and the pandemic has further accelerated this paradigm. The World Economic Forum is predicting that by 2025, over half of all tasks will be performed by machines, a first in human history. To support this trend, our industrial customer base is boosting deployments of robots and cobots. Over the next 5 years, the global robot installed base is expected to increase by about 60%. With industrial motors currently consuming 25% of all the world's electricity, we urgently need to deploy technologies that not only deliver speed and accuracy, safety and flexibility, but also energy savings. 
Now let me share a few examples of how our technologies are meeting these challenges in automation. So firstly, variable speed drives can reduce motor energy consumption by up to 40% in a robot. Our precision signal chain, isolation and power management technologies together increase response time and improve power conversion. Secondly, our time-of-flight sensing technology allows robots to sense and interpret the world around them, so our customers can deploy more robots per square foot and improve worker safety. Thirdly, our OtoSense condition-based monitoring solution presciently identifies motor inefficiencies, enabling customers to proactively optimize and repair machinery. This avoids costly downtime and lowers energy consumption by 10%. 
Importantly, these technologies that improve motor efficiency and robotic control can save almost 1 gigaton of annual CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 330 million residential homes. In total, automation is a key component of our industrial business, supporting tens of thousands of customers. We expect this accelerated digitalization to drive continued growth in 2021 and beyond.  
Now I'll turn to electrification and discuss the important role ADI is playing as consumer demand for greener transportation accelerates. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 215 million electric vehicles on the road, up exponentially from about 7 million today. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of the electric vehicle journey, from supporting EV infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. 
So I'll share now how our technologies are impacting this ecosystem. First, the shift to renewable energy sources drives great environmental benefits, but also creates new obstacles in distribution, transmission and stability. This requires the smart grid, which can digitally monitor and adjust performance. Our control and sensing technologies are critical to ensuring the grid parameters remain stable and prevent shutdowns. This shift also requires energy storage systems to mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. Here, our high accuracy monitoring and efficient power conversion technologies help extend systems battery life by more than 30%.  
Turning to the battery, which is the most expensive vehicle part. Our battery management system, or BMS, enables up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. As the market leader, over half of the top 10 electric vehicle brands use ADI's BMS technology today. In addition, last fall, we introduced the industry's first wireless BMS platform. This is all the benefits of our wired solution by lowering vehicle weight and enabling a scalable battery architecture, paving the way for reuse in storage systems. 
GM's Ultium platform uses our wireless BMS technology, which is expected to be deployed across 30 different models by 2025. Interests in our wireless BMS technology is rising. And last quarter, we recorded our second OEM design win. Importantly, the environmental impact from our BMS capabilities is notable. In 2020 alone, vehicles equipped with ADI's BMS technologies prevented approximately 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Our solutions utilized at the battery formation stage enable more current density, thereby shrinking our customers' equipment footprint by up to 4x and reducing per channel costs by nearly half.  
Our technology makes it possible for factories to recycle more than 80% of the energy used during the formation back into the power grid. Based on today's production levels, energy recycling during formation reduces CO2 output by about 1 million tonnes annually. So all told, electrification not only represents a highly valuable market with long-term revenue growth opportunities, but one that will be critical to the preservation of our precious natural ecosystem.  
So finally, let me turn to connectivity. In the face of the pandemic, connectivity has been the foundation that is sustaining and powering our society and the economy. And while the communications market is not known historically for its sustainability benefits, this ability to stay connected and productive from anywhere has also had a positive impact on the environment. A clear proof point is the reduction of global carbon emissions by a record 7% in 2020. 
By 2030, forecasts suggest mobile traffic will increase by about 17-fold. This exponential increase in wireless data, combined with pervasive cloud computing, puts IP traffic on pace to double every 2.5 years. And ADI is playing a critical role in building out the next-generation infrastructure to support this exponential increase in data, from capturing the signal at the base station air interface to transferring the information to the data center while substantially decreasing power.  
So ADI has invested ahead and reshaped the 5G radio architecture, our software-defined transceivers with complementary precision signal chain and power technologies are vital to enabling the 5G massive MIMO architecture. When comparing 5G to 4G, our solutions help deliver a 90% decrease in energy per bit at the air interface by decreasing the channel count by 10x, while maintaining the radio size and thermal performance. With the exponential upswing in data generation, our customers are upgrading their optical infrastructure from 100 to 400 gigabits per second. Our precision signal chain technologies help enable these optical modules maintain constant power, while operating at 4x the data rate. And with the customers looking to increase to 1 terabit and beyond, ADI's opportunity will continue to expand.  
Capturing and transporting data efficiently is important, but computing and data centers is the primary source of energy consumption in the connectivity ecosystem. Currently, data centers generate more than 130 million tonnes of CO2 per year globally. So this is where the transition from 12 to 48-volt power distribution can reduce power loss and increase compute density. Our 48-volt core micromodules, power and power system monitoring solutions are enabling this transition. And according to Alphabet, this approach can improve data center energy efficiency by 30%. All told, ADI is part of the ecosystem, enabling greater efficiency in wireless and wire data capture, transmission and, of course, computing. And our solutions help customers to scale their investments and build next-generation networks economically and resourcefully.  
So stepping back, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and our mission to Engineer Good, but a lot remains yet to be done. We're focused on partnering with our customers to develop increasingly innovative technologies that create successful business outcomes, enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world.  
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a strong first quarter with results at the high end of our outlook. Revenue increased 20%, nearing an all-time high; operating margin expanded to 40.7%, in line with our long-term model; and adjusted EPS grew 40%. We saw tremendous breadth this quarter with all market segments growing year-over-year, the first time in over 3 years, and B2B revenue increased 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, with double-digit growth across each end market.  
Industrial represented 55% of revenue during the quarter, increased 5% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. This represented a record quarter for industrial with broad-based strength across applications, customers and geographies. Specifically, demand across our automation, instrumentation and energy businesses accelerated this quarter. 
Communications, which represented 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 10% sequentially, but increased 16% year-over-year. Both wireless and wireline revenue grew double digits despite 0 revenue from Huawei this quarter. 
Automotive, which represented 16% of revenue, increased 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. With the industry aggressively ramping up production, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all applications. BMS exhibited the highest growth, a trend we expect to continue given our growing design pipeline. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, increased 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in hearables, wearables and home entertainment. This quarter's inflection puts us on track to return to full year growth in 2021.  
And now for the rest of the P&L. Gross margin, which is seasonally weaker in the first quarter, finished flat sequentially at 70%. We anticipate our first quarter's gross margin will be the trough for the year as we benefit from a strong top line, improving utilization and capturing the majority of the LTC cost savings. OpEx in the quarter was $456 million, up sequentially and year-over-year due mainly to variable compensation. Op margins finished at 40.7%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $27 million and better than our outlook due to an investment gain. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. So all told, adjusted EPS came in above the high end of guidance at $1.44. This included a $0.04 benefit from an investment gain that was not in our prior outlook.  
Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars increased modestly, while inventory days finished at 119, down from 121 in the fourth quarter. Channel inventory, as measured in weeks, was flat sequentially and remained well below our 7 to 8-week target. CapEx in the quarter increased to $67 million or roughly 4% of sales. We are working judiciously to add CapEx to meet this record demand and anticipate that CapEx will run slightly above our long-term target of 4% for fiscal 2021.  
Turning to cash flow, over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion or 33% of revenue. You'll recall that during the last year, we paused our share repurchase program for a few quarters due to the pandemic and our proposed Maxim acquisition. Therefore, in 2020, we returned 80% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. This quarter, we've reinstated our share repurchase program, and given our current 1.5 leverage ratio, we're committed to returning 100% of free cash flow for the year.  
Looking at the first quarter, we executed nearly $160 million of repo, and we also announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend at $0.69 per share, which marks our 18th increase over the last 17 years.  
Before moving on to guidance, I want to provide some context on the current state of supply. A sharper than expected recovery in the economy, coupled with a lean inventory backdrop, is fueling unprecedented demand for semiconductors and putting stress on the global supply chain. While the industry at large is aggressively working to meet this historic demand, it's more than likely we will be operating in a constrained supply environment for the balance of the year. At ADI, we're confident in our ability to outperform in times like this. Our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, healthy balance sheet inventory and diversified product and customer base position us well. In addition, we're working to secure additional capacity from our external partners and ramping our internal operations to increase output.
Now let me provide our second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.6 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects what would be record revenue. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth for automotive, industrial and consumer markets, but we do see a decline in our comps. Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be 41%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS will be $1.44, plus or minus $0.08. 
So in summary, I'm encouraged by the near-term trends we're seeing across our end markets. And while we're mindful of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway. And with Maxim expected to close this summer, 2021 will be a transformative year for ADI. 
Let me now pass it back to Mike to start our Q&A."

Prashanth, I just want to talk a little bit about how the model unfolds from here. I mean clearly, you talked about already hitting the gross margin trough for the year, but you're guiding EPS sort of flattish on up revenue. I'm just kind of curious, how should we be thinking about OpEx from current run rate levels? And specifically, is there incremental OpEx needed because of the tight supply situation?

So the way to think about OpEx is that if you recall in the proxy, we identified that last year, in the first half, we had a particularly low bonus payout as a reflection of the macroeconomic environment. In the first half of this year, you're going to see the opposite effect of that. So on average, it's a normal bonus payout, but you do see a significant upswing in our variable comps for -- which is impacting both the first and the second quarter compares. In addition, we have the merit increase, that if you remember, we put that merit increase in several months later than normal as a result of the pandemic last year. So you're beginning to see that on a full year run rate basis in first quarter and then it will carry into second quarter. 
So beyond these comp-related items, OpEx is really at a steady level. We are not requiring any additional investment at the OpEx level to support the demand that we're generating."

So we are producing and shipping at record levels, and second quarter outlook is going to be a record. We have enough capacity to meet the guide, but additional -- significant additional upside versus that guide will depend on what we're able to procure both from an external wafer standpoint as well as the capital that we are in the process of deploying into our internal facilities to support that. 
What we're doing to help alleviate that situation is we have been consistently building inventory since last summer to deplete what was pulled down during the pandemic shutdowns. We are adding additional supply, both internally, and I mentioned the capital that we're deploying, which is mostly going to the back end. And then externally, we've gone out and acquired additional wafers from our partners. 
So the -- I think the answer to your question on CapEx is that it's mostly for test. And then on the capacity side, where we can get additional capacity from our partners, we're doing that. But even with this additional capacity, it's very likely that the strength of demand is going to outplace -- outpace supply for some period of time. So I think we will be chasing demand at least through the balance of this year.
From a capital deployment standpoint, some of that -- as we guide as a percentage of revenue, some of that is dependent on how strong the year continues to roll out. So when I say slightly above 4%, it could come down to -- or maybe just a hair below if revenue continues to clip along here."

So while we see some hotspots, we're really talking about is a few weeks of extension in different places. 
I would remind you, too, that we run this company -- we run our manufacturing plans, the operating plans are run to POS rather than POA. So what we're seeing right now is a good balance between POS and POA. But as Prashanth said, we're preparing for quite a bit of upside during this year, and we've pretty substantially increased the CapEx in our back end."

So we do think comms troughs in second quarter and then begins to pick up in the second half with the global 5G.

But I will stress, there's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. And I don't want to get into the business of making strong speculative predictions here, but we can only kind of guide 1 quarter at the time, particularly in this varying market.
But if I look at the markets and just kind of peel the story back a little bit for you. So our industrial business, which represents about half of the company's revenue, was down. We had 2 consecutive down years in '19 and '20. But we produced a record quarter in the first. We expect ongoing strength in that business. And one thing I'm very, very pleased about is that the most diverse part of our industrial business is automation. And I think given the strength of our opportunity pipeline, the new products we've got coming to market, I expect to see a multiyear tailwind in the automation part. 
I think right now, there's -- in automotive, there's a big push to electric vehicles. And I see that, as I said in the prepared remarks, that is expected to grow by 2030 from kind of 7 million deployed electric vehicles today to over 200 million by 2030. And we talked a lot the last quarter about the strength of our cabin electronics business, active noise cancellation, premium audio, our A2B bus deployments and all that, too, provides good tailwinds for the company going ahead. 
Comms, as we've just narrated, weakened the first half of '21. But really, I think that's about the timing of deployments. And my expectation is that, that business will snap back in the second half of '21 and continue into '22. 
Last but not least, our consumer business has shown a couple of sequential growth quarters. And we no longer have the overhang of 1 big socket and 1 big customer. So with the diversity of our business, we've -- we're addressing more applications. We have a stronger product portfolio than we had, say, 3 years ago. I think we're on a growth track in that business, and we're certainly off to a very, very good start. So we believe that '20 was the bottom of that business. And certainly, the signals are that is the case."

Like most of our peers in the industry, there are supply constraints in parts of the business. So we're not able to meet all the demand, particularly in auto, which has been very, very well publicized. And the constraints continue across the front end in wafer procurement and also the back end. But I will remind you, too, we produce about half our silicon inside ADI and the other half we procure with external partners.
So I think something else worth noting is that we've been building inventory since last summer in terms of die stock and finished goods, which was heavily depleted during the pandemic shutdown. So as I said internally, we're ramping up our own manufacturing operations, and we've been successful in acquiring additional wafers from our external partners.

And overall, when I look at the, for example, power, the mixed signal portfolio as well as the battery management side of things, we have more than $500 million worth of new revenue going to production this year. And that's just the beginning. So in terms of areas where we're winning, we've got notable wins in communications, in wireless as well as data center and cloud. In automotive, we're strongly attaching to our infotainment business, the autonomous radar systems. And the strongest surge in terms of growth in industrial for the LT portfolio, the additional cross-selling is instrumentation test and micromodules, generally speaking, across the board, we're seeing very, very strong demand for those products. 
So I think all that said, we had expected that we would double the LTC growth to -- from kind of 3% to 4% historically to high single digits in a 5-year period. And that's quite similar to how we viewed our opportunity with Hittite at the beginning and what also has materialized. So that's the story in terms of the markets and the expected growth."

So I'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insight into how we are shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future.
The first quarter, we delivered strong results that came in at the high end of our outlook. Revenue was $1.56 billion and increased 20% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based with growth across all end markets, highlighted by a record quarter for our industrial business. We delivered gross margin of 70% and up margin of nearly 41%. All told, we produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.44. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 33% free cash flow margin, placing us in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very pleased with our team's performance this quarter.
Now I'd like to discuss how we are advancing our mission of Engineering Good for the planet, social health and economic prosperity, which in turn will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Awareness of the world's environmental degradation and climate change specifically is growing tremendously with a global call to action building momentum. Semiconductors, as the bedrock of the modern digital economy, have a major role to play in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. At ADI, our technology sit at the intersection of our customers and society's most pressing challenges, and we're uniquely positioned to drive positive impact. 
Our industry-leading portfolio, with its breadth of capabilities, defines the edge of performance and inherently delivers sustainable benefits. With each generation of chip design, we increase efficiency while enhancing the performance of our customer systems. This portfolio supports customers of all sizes and spans industries that are aligned with key secular trends. So today, I'll focus on where ADI's Engineering Good across the automation, electrification and connectivity sectors.
Firstly, the automation of human routines. Factory floors and supply chains is critical to our future, and the pandemic has further accelerated this paradigm. The World Economic Forum is predicting that by 2025, over half of all tasks will be performed by machines, a first in human history. To support this trend, our industrial customer base is boosting deployments of robots and cobots. Over the next 5 years, the global robot installed base is expected to increase by about 60%. With industrial motors currently consuming 25% of all the world's electricity, we urgently need to deploy technologies that not only deliver speed and accuracy, safety and flexibility, but also energy savings.
Now let me share a few examples of how our technologies are meeting these challenges in automation. So firstly, variable speed drives can reduce motor energy consumption by up to 40% in a robot. Our precision signal chain, isolation and power management technologies together increase response time and improve power conversion. Secondly, our time-of-flight sensing technology allows robots to sense and interpret the world around them, so our customers can deploy more robots per square foot and improve worker safety. Thirdly, our OtoSense condition-based monitoring solution presently identifies motor inefficiencies, enabling customers to proactively optimize and repair machinery. This avoids costly downtime and lowers energy consumption by 10%.
Importantly, these technologies that improve motor efficiency and robotic control can save almost 1 gigaton of annual CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 330 million residential homes. In total, automation is a key component of our industrial business, supporting tens of thousands of customers. We expect this accelerated digitalization to drive continued growth in 2021 and beyond.
Now I'll turn to electrification and discuss the important role ADI is playing as consumer demand for greener transportation accelerates. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 215 million electric vehicles on the road, up exponentially from about 7 million today. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of the electric vehicle journey, from supporting EV infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. 
So I'll share now how our technologies are impacting this ecosystem. First, the shift to renewable energy sources drives great environmental benefits, but also creates new obstacles in distribution, transmission and stability. This requires the smart grid, which can digitally monitor and adjust performance. Our control and sensing technologies are critical to ensuring the grid parameters remain stable and prevent shutdowns. This shift also requires energy storage systems to mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. Here, our high accuracy monitoring and efficient power conversion technologies help extend systems battery life by more than 30%.
Turning to the battery, which is the most expensive vehicle part. Our battery management system, or BMS, enables up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. As the market leader, over half of the top 10 electric vehicle brands use ADI's BMS technology today. In addition, last fall, we introduced the industry's first wireless BMS platform. This is all the benefits of our wired solution by lowering vehicle weights and enabling a scalable battery architecture, paving the way for reuse in storage systems. 
GM's Ultium platform uses our wireless BMS technology, which is expected to be deployed across 30 different models by 2025. Interests in our wireless BMS technology is rising. And last quarter, we recorded our second OEM design win. Importantly, the environmental impact from our BMS capabilities is notable. In 2020 alone, vehicles equipped with ADI's BMS technologies prevented approximately 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Our solutions utilized at the battery formation stage enable more current density, thereby shrinking our customers' equipment footprint by up to 4x and reducing per channel costs by nearly half.
Our technology makes it possible for factories to recycle more than 80% of the energy used during the formation back into the power grid. Based on today's production levels, energy recycling during formation reduces CO2 output by about 1 million tonnes annually. So all told, electrification not only represents a highly valuable market with long-term revenue growth opportunities, but one that will be critical to the preservation of our precious natural ecosystem.
So finally, let me turn to connectivity. In the face of the pandemic, connectivity has been the foundation that is sustaining and powering our society and the economy. And while the communications market is not known historically for its sustainability benefits, this ability to stay connected and productive from anywhere has also had a positive impact on the environment. A clear proof point is the reduction of global carbon emissions by a record 7% in 2020.
By 2030, forecasts suggest mobile traffic will increase by about 17x. This exponential increase in wireless data, combined with pervasive cloud computing, puts IP traffic on pace to double every 2.5 years. And ADI is playing a critical role in building out the next-generation infrastructure to support this exponential increase in data, from capturing the signal at the base station air interface to transferring the information to the data center while substantially decreasing power.
So ADI has invested ahead and reshaped the 5G radio architecture, our software-defined transceivers with complementary precision signal chain and power technologies are vital to enabling the 5G massive MIMO architecture. When comparing 5G to 4G, our solutions help deliver a 90% decrease in energy per bit at the air interface by decreasing the channel count by 10x, while maintaining the radio size and thermal performance. With the exponential upswing in data generation, our customers are upgrading their optical infrastructure from 100 to 400 gigabits per second. Our precision signal chain technologies help enable these optical modules maintain constant power, while operating at 4x the data rate. And with the customers looking to increase to 1 terabit and beyond, ADI's opportunity will continue to expand.
Capturing and transporting data efficiently is important, but computing and data centers is the primary source of energy consumption in the connectivity ecosystem. Currently, data centers generate more than 130 million tonnes of CO2 per year globally. So this is where the transition from 12- to 48-volt power distribution can reduce power loss and increase compute density. Our 48-volt core micromodules, power and power system monitoring solutions are enabling this transition. And according to Alphabet, this approach can improve data center energy efficiency by 30%. All told, ADI is part of the ecosystem, enabling greater efficiency in wireless and wire data capture, transmission and, of course, computing. And our solutions help customers to scale their investments and build next-generation networks economically and resourcefully.
So stepping back, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and our mission to Engineer Good, but a lot remains yet to be done. We're focused on partnering with our customers to develop increasingly innovative technologies that create successful business outcomes, enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world.
And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a strong first quarter with results at the high end of our outlook. Revenue increased 20%, nearing an all-time high; operating margin expanded to 40.7%, in line with our long-term model; and adjusted EPS grew 40%. We saw tremendous breadth this quarter with all market segments growing year-over-year, the first time in over 3 years, and B2B revenue increased 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, with double-digit growth across each end market.
Industrial represented 55% of revenue during the quarter, increased 5% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. This represented a record quarter for industrial with broad-based strength across applications, customers and geographies. Specifically, demand across our automation, instrumentation and energy businesses accelerated this quarter.
Communications, which represented 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 10% sequentially, but increased 16% year-over-year. Both wireless and wireline revenue grew double digits despite 0 revenue from Huawei this quarter. Automotive, which represented 16% of revenue, increased 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year.
With the industry aggressively ramping up production, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all applications. BMS exhibited the highest growth, a trend we expect to continue given our growing design pipeline. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, increased 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in hearables, wearables and home entertainment. This quarter's inflection puts us on track to return to full year growth in 2021.
And now for the rest of the P&L. Gross margin, which is seasonally weaker in the first quarter, finished flat sequentially at 70%. We anticipate our first quarter's gross margin will be the trough for the year as we benefit from a strong top line, improving utilization and capturing the majority of the LTC cost savings. OpEx in the quarter was $456 million, up sequentially and year-over-year due mainly to variable compensation. Op margins finished at 40.7%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $27 million and better than our outlook due to an investment gain. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. So all told, adjusted EPS came in above the high end of guidance at $1.44. This included a $0.04 benefit from an investment gain that was not in our prior outlook.
Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars increased modestly, while inventory days finished at 119, down from 121 in the fourth quarter. Channel inventory, as measured in weeks, was flat sequentially and remained well below our 7- to 8-week target. CapEx in the quarter increased to $67 million or roughly 4% of sales. We are working judiciously to add CapEx to meet this record demand and anticipate that CapEx will run slightly above our long-term target of 4% for fiscal 2021.
Turning to cash flow, over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion or 33% of revenue. You'll recall that during the last year, we paused our share repurchase program for a few quarters due to the pandemic and our proposed Maxim acquisition. Therefore, in 2020, we returned 80% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. This quarter, we've reinstated our share repurchase program, and given our current 1.5 leverage ratio, we're committed to returning 100% of free cash flow for the year.
Looking at the first quarter, we executed nearly $160 million of repo, and we also announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend at $0.69 per share, which marks our 18th increase over the last 17 years.
Before moving on to guidance, I want to provide some context on the current state of supply. A sharper than expected recovery in the economy, coupled with a lean inventory backdrop, is fueling unprecedented demand for semiconductors and putting stress on the global supply chain. While the industry at large is aggressively working to meet this historic demand, it's more than likely we will be operating in a constrained supply environment for the balance of the year. At ADI, we're confident in our ability to outperform in times like this. Our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, healthy balance sheet inventory and diversified product and customer base position us well. In addition, we're working to secure additional capacity from our external partners and ramping our internal operations to increase output.
Now let me provide our second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.6 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, this guidance reflects what would be record revenue. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth for automotive, industrial and consumer markets, but we do see a decline in our comps. Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be 41%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS will be $1.44, plus or minus $0.08.
So in summary, I'm encouraged by the near-term trends we're seeing across our end markets. And while we're mindful of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway. And with Maxim expected to close this summer, 2021 will be a transformative year for ADI.
Let me now pass it back to Mike to start our Q&A."

In addition, we have the merit increase, that if you remember, we put that merit increase in several months later than normal as a result of the pandemic last year.

So we are producing and shipping at record levels, and second quarter outlook is going to be a record. We have enough capacity to meet the guide, but additional -- significant additional upside versus that guide will depend on what we're able to procure both from an external wafer standpoint as well as the capital that we are in the process of deploying into our internal facilities to support that.
What we're doing to help alleviate that situation is we have been consistently building inventory since last summer to deplete what was pulled down during the pandemic shutdowns. We are adding additional supply, both internally, and I mentioned the capital that we're deploying, which is mostly going to the back end. And then externally, we've gone out and acquired additional wafers from our partners.
So the -- I think the answer to your question on CapEx is that it's mostly for test. And then on the capacity side, where we can get additional capacity from our partners, we're doing that. But even with this additional capacity, it's very likely that the strength of demand is going to outplace -- outpace supply for some period of time. So I think we will be chasing demand at least through the balance of this year.
From a capital deployment standpoint, some of that -- as we guide as a percentage of revenue, some of that is dependent on how strong the year continues to roll out. And so when I say slightly above 4%, it could come down to -- or maybe just a hair below if revenue continues to clip along here."

So we entered our first quarter with what we would have called normal lead times. But during the quarter and into the early part of this quarter, we've seen lead times extend, which I think is pretty consistent with the industry at large. So while we see some hotspots, what we're really talking about is a few weeks of extension in different places.
I would remind you, too, that we run this company, we run our manufacturing plans, the operating plans are run to POS rather than POA. So what we're seeing right now is a good balance between POS and POA. But as Prashanth said, we're preparing for quite a bit of upside during this year, and we've pretty substantially increased the CapEx in our back end."

What we have seen is a bit more of a slowdown in China as they're digesting kind of the 5G that they've deployed and the channel counts are a bit lower.
So we do think comms troughs in second quarter and then begins to pick up in the second half with the global 5G. In terms of our view on whether we can grow comms on a year-over-year basis, given the significant headwind we have from Huawei going to 0, that's a tough ask."

But I will stress, there's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. And I don't want to get into the business of making strong speculative predictions here, but we can only kind of guide 1 quarter at a time, particularly in this variating market.
But if I look at the markets and just kind of peel the story back a little bit for you, so our industrial business, which represents about half of the company's revenue, was down. We had 2 consecutive down years in '19 and '20. But we produced a record quarter in the first. We expect ongoing strength in that business. And one thing I'm very, very pleased about is that the most diverse part of our industrial business is automation. And I think given the strength of our opportunity pipeline, the new products we've got coming to market, I expect to see a multiyear tailwind in the automation part.
I think right now, there's -- in automotive, there's a big push to electric vehicles. And I see that, as I said in the prepared remarks, that is expected to grow by 2030 from kind of 7 million deployed electric vehicles today to over 200 million by 2030. And we talked a lot the last quarter about the strength of our cabin electronics business, active noise cancellation, premium audio, our A2B bus deployments and all that, too, provides good tailwinds for the company going ahead.
Comms, as we've just narrated, weakened the first half of '21. But really, I think that's about the timing of deployments. And my expectation is that, that business will snap back in the second half of '21 and continue into '22. 
Last but not least, our consumer business has shown a couple of sequential growth quarters. And we no longer have the overhang of one big socket and one big customer. So with the diversity of our business, we've -- we're addressing more applications. We have a stronger product portfolio than we had, say, 3 years ago. I think we're on a growth track in that business, and we're certainly off to a very, very good start. So we believe that '20 was the bottom of that business. And certainly, the signals are that is the case."

So we're certainly keeping ahead. Our investments are keeping ahead of these revenue levels, obviously.
Like most of our peers in the industry, there are supply constraints in parts of the business. So we're not able to meet all the demand, particularly in auto, which has been very, very well publicized. And the constraints continue across the front end in wafer procurement and also the back end. But I will remind you, too, we produce about half our silicon inside ADI and the other half we procure with external partners.
So I think something else worth noting is that we've been building inventory since last summer in terms of die stock and finished goods, which was heavily depleted during the pandemic shutdown. So as I said internally, we're ramping up our own manufacturing operations, and we've been successful in acquiring additional wafers from our external partners.

In automotive, we're strongly attaching to our infotainment business, the autonomous radar systems. And the strongest surge in terms of growth in industrial for the LT portfolio, the additional cross-selling, it is instrumentation test and micromodules, generally speaking, across the board, we're seeing very, very strong demand for those products.
So I think all that said, we had expected that we would double the LTC growth to -- from kind of 3% to 4% historically to high single digits in a 5-year period.

So I'm very pleased to share with you that we delivered record revenue and earnings in the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our outlook. This strength was driven by our disciplined operational execution and our ability to capture the value presented as our solutions become more vital in the modern digital economy. 
The supply and demand dynamics in our industry have been well publicized. Broadly speaking, the economic recovery has materialized faster and stronger than initially anticipated, placing unprecedented stress on supply chains globally. Late last year, ADI moved with speed and agility, proactively making capital investments to add capacity, positioning us to navigate this disruption and better serve our customers. That said, we, like many others in the industry, will face a supply-constrained environment through the balance of 2021. Despite this backdrop, we're positioned for a strong second half as our continued capital investments are aligned with robust demand. 
Moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $1.66 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based, highlighted by record quarters for our industrial and automotive markets. Gross margin expanded to nearly 71% and operating margin to approximately 42%. Adjusted EPS of $1.54 increased 43% year-over-year. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow. This equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500.
So overall, I'm very proud how the ADI team executed this quarter to deliver these impressive results. At ADI, innovation is the root of how we generate value, and to maintain our virtuous cycle of innovation-driven success, we invest more than $1 billion in R&D annually. This commitment, coupled with the diversity of our business across customers, products and applications, positions us to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
Now let me share a few customer highlights with you. ADI's solutions are embedded across the electrification ecosystem, from developing and managing the vehicle battery to the distribution and storage across the digital grid. With the rapid shift to EVs, we're seeing new and increasing investments in battery manufacturing capacity. This quarter, we secured a design win with the supplier of one of the world's top battery producers. Our innovative solution reduces system costs by half by integrating all measurement, control and diagnostics functions. And our portfolio of wired and wireless BMS provides unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range as we grow and diversify our BMS business. This quarter, we added Volvo as well as 3 additional large auto manufacturers, including a prominent luxury brand in Europe and 2 leading brands in Asia. 
Moving on to energy infrastructure. Here, energy storage systems are required to make renewable energy a reality and to build the charging infrastructure to support EV proliferation. Our precision signal chain, power management and BMS portfolios deliver the level of accuracy necessary to ensure consistent supply across the digital grid. We have design wins at more than 80% of the top customers from traditional energy and industrial companies to new entrants. 
Another area of increasing importance for ADI is connectivity which, of course, is becoming more pervasive across demographics and industries, presenting new opportunities for us. For example, in our communications business, we announced a complete radio platform for the 5G O-RAN ecosystem. This radio platform builds on our market-leading integrated transceiver position by expanding into the digital front end. Our full system solution enables significant size and performance improvements while reducing customers' design cycles. 
O-RAN represents a new vector of growth in the communications market by enabling new entrants and applications such as private networks that support connected factories. In addition to partnerships with Intel and Marvell, we are working with key carriers and system integrators to enable this ecosystem. 
In our space business, our beam-forming solution will be used in Telesat's Lightspeed LEO satellite constellation scheduled to launch in late 2023. This win speaks to the breadth and depth our RF portfolio and the main expertise at ADI, which is supporting the adoption broadly of LEO communication satellites. 
Additionally, we continue to have strong design momentum across our diversified industrial market, the largest, stickiest and most profitable business at ADI. Over the years, we've established a heritage of providing the most precise and efficient solutions required by our factory automation customers. I believe we're at a tipping point in Industrial 4.0 (sic) [ Industry 4.0 ] as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make supply chains more robust, more efficient and flexible. 
We recently won an ultra-high frequency wireless solution at a key automation company. Our solution is being used in advanced robotic systems to reduce downtime and costs. On the wired side, customers are beginning to upgrade to deterministic Ethernet to ensure machines are constantly connected and monitored. This quarter, we secured numerous design wins for our robust Ethernet solution, including 2 of the largest European industrial machine manufacturers. 
We recently hosted a deep dive on our instrumentation and test business. This is truly a performance-driven market that requires ADI's most advanced technology and solutions, making it a great fit for our high-performance precision signal chain, power and RF portfolios. Our broad diverse instrumentation business comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments is aligned with all secular growth trends across our industry. The increasing complexity of these applications is driving the need for solutions with more advanced technology capabilities. As a result, we expect our SAM to increase by over 20% in the next 5 years. 
Now these examples represent only a fraction of the incredible work across ADI. Our team is partnering with our customers every day to develop increasingly innovative technologies that not only create successful business outcomes but also enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world. To that end, I wanted to share an exciting update on how we're leveraging innovation to advance our mission of Engineering Good. 
In April, we launched an innovation accelerator with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As part of this program, we'll be combining ADI's engineers and technologies with WHOI's science and technology platforms to continuously monitor critical oceanographic conditions. This effort supports our overall climate agenda, which includes our commitments to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. We also published our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report last week, which provides additional information on how our technologies will continue to play a major role in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. 
So in closing, the last year has underscored how semiconductors, as the bedrock of the modern digital economy and information age, are increasingly important to accelerating digitalization across all industries. We're encouraged by our results this quarter, and the momentum in our pipeline sets the stage for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. So with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth, who'll take you through the financial details."

Good morning, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press relea",897,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
ADI delivered a record second quarter as revenue, operating margin and EPS finished above the high end of our outlook. As I mentioned last quarter, upside to our second quarter outlook would be predicated on our ability to increase production. And thanks to early strategic investments in capacity as well as strong execution by our manufacturing operations team, we did just that. 
Now let's look at performance by end market. Industrial represented 59% of revenue and increased 14% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. This quarter marks the second consecutive all-time high for industrial. We saw strength across all applications and geographies, with all subsegments growing double digits sequentially and year-over-year. 
Communications represented 17% of revenue, fell slightly sequentially and was flat year-over-year. Wireline increased double digits year-over-year, which balanced softness in wireless. As we outlined in the last call, 5G builds have been muted year-to-date. However, we anticipate momentum to pick up as 5G deployments broaden globally in the second half of this year, especially in North America now that the C-band auction is complete. 
Automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Again, we saw double-digit growth across every major application as industry production has picked up notably from a year ago. BMS grew the fastest, more than doubling year-over-year. And lastly, consumer decreased 12% sequentially in the seasonally weaker second quarter and represented 9% of revenue. Importantly, consumer grew 8% year-over-year, positioning us to deliver growth in fiscal '21. 
Now covering the rest of the P&L. Gross margin finished just under 71%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 320 basis points year-over-year on higher utilization and better product mix. We expect additional gross margin expansion in the second half as we realize savings from the consolidation of our manufacturing operations. 
OpEx in the quarter was $484 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Merit increases went into effect during the second quarter, and we also recorded higher variable comp due to the strong results. This netted operating margin of 41.7%. Non-op expenses were $44 million, down nearly 10% from the prior year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate was approximately 12%. And all-in adjusted EPS of $1.54 exceeded the high end of our outlook and marks an all-time high. 
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Relative to the first quarter, inventory dollars increased $23 million to a record $641 million. This increase was driven entirely by raw material and work in process as we ramped utilization to better meet the strong customer demand. Days of inventory were relatively unchanged at 118. Weeks of channel inventory finished lower sequentially once again. And due to the strong sell-through at our [ distis ], we anticipate remaining below our 7- to 8-week target through the end of the year. CapEx for the quarter was $59 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $127 million or more than double compared to the second half of 2020. We expect to continue to increase capital investments and for CapEx to trend above our long-term model of 4% this year. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, which equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin. And over the same period, we returned approximately 75% of free cash flow after debt repayments via dividends and repos. This is below our long-term target as we paused our buyback program, given the pandemic uncertainty and the pending Maxim deal. We ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, and our net leverage is now [ 1.3 ] on a trailing 12. We're comfortable with the leverage and do not plan to reduce debt. As such, we remain committed to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. 
So let me finish up with our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.7 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. This is in line with seasonality after a very strong Q2. At the midpoint, we expect each of our B2B markets to increase slightly sequentially and consumer to be up low double digits. Based on the midpoint of guide, op margin is expected to be [ 42.5 ] plus or minus 100 bps, and our tax rate is expected to fall between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.61, plus or minus $0.11. 
So in summary, ADI delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record revenue, earnings and free cash flow conversion. Importantly, bookings and backlog remain very strong, and we're continuing to invest to increase production for the balance of the year, giving us great confidence that our second half will be stronger than our first. We've also made meaningful progress towards closing the Maxim acquisition. Shortly after the deal closes, we are going to hold a conference call to provide an update regarding our capital return plans. As a reminder, once combined, we anticipate having more than $3 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below 1. Let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A."

So we're experiencing significant growth in demand and it's very broad-based, all of our markets. And when you rewind and think how we got here, our customers entered the pandemic with pretty lean inventories, then we had this synchronized government stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. We had very strong growth during the pandemic of consumer electronics with the high use of cloud compute, connectivity. 
We're coming out of the pandemic now with GDP driving industrial, and that's driving companies to rethink both where they manufacture and upgrading the style by which they manufacture. So on the supply side, we've been planning for additional capacity, as Vince mentioned, since late summer of 2020. And as we add capacity, our revenue forecast is increasing, and that's really what helped us deliver a better Q2 guide, up for Q3 and feel good about Q4. 
So I think supply will eventually match demand but I don't see demand really going away. So this feels -- given the secular drivers behind it, it feels that this is going to be with us for a while. Book-to-bill for the past quarter was above 1 and it was the same for all end markets. So it's again very broad-based. And I think it's really just a reflection of the incredible role that ADI's products play across the manufacturing ecosystem."

We're working with our customers, both large and small, across all markets to understand the demand timing and to allocate the supply based on end demand. Remember that while we report on a POA basis, we actually run the business on POS, so we look through distribution to understand what's happening at customers. 
We've also put in a noncancelable, nonreturnable for up to 90 days to help give us better visibility into the backlog, and that helps customers sort of manage what they can expect to get from us. So at this point, I would say the focus really has been on communication.

Well, we've seen -- this is a very, very highly diversified business. We saw broad growth across all the individual sectors. In fact, all applications grew double digits year-over-year and sequentially. And I believe there's a lot more upside to come because we're in a multiyear growth cycle driven by secular trends, Industry 4.0, et cetera. 
I would say the -- we've seen really strong acceleration in the automation sector. And I think that's driven by such things as the need for onshoring, more flexibility and more robust and connected supply chains. If I just pick health care, it has already been a multiyear growth market for ADI. And the pandemic kind of underscored the importance of information technology in managing our health care systems. So we've seen an acceleration in our digital health care business as we begin to migrate the hospital environment to the clinic and the home with point-of-care solutions or ""health care anywhere"" mentality. 
And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, the energy sector, with the move to renewables and this charging infrastructure that's being laid in to support these electric vehicles, those are some of the areas that we're seeing strongest growth within the industrial area. But I think automation underpins it. Also, I would say, I've been very pleased with the results that we're getting and the very broad bench scientific and test equipment, analytics equipment and so on. So it's been very, very broad."

Well, first off, we're the market share leader in the electric vehicle battery management systems. And as you know, we have really 2 portfolios. We have the existing, we like to call it the wired portfolio, the more traditional way of moving data from the battery system. And we've introduced a wireless version, a robust cognitive radio-based wireless system. So I think the next 12 months will be driven by the traditional wired battery technology. 
And after that, in late '22 into 2023, we'll begin to see the upsurge of the wireless battery technology that will complement the wired. So what I believe will happen is today, what have we got, 2 million, 3 million cars per year being produced, electric vehicles being produced. That's going to move to, we believe, somewhere 10x at least over the next 7, 8 years. So this is a multi, multiyear cycle. 
Our BMS chips today are being used in over half of the top 10 selling EV cars globally, and we're gaining share in each of those areas. Today, our best position is in North America and China. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're beginning to make real tracks in Europe as well as Japan and Korea. So ultimately, if a manufacturer wants the most miles per charge, they're going to turn to ADI. So that's what we're working on."

So I'm not as concerned about the inflation side. We have been very mindful of the labor side. And I would say that the data we're seeing is that it's taking us about a week longer than normal to fill jobs at the factory level. So our U.S. factories are facing a little bit longer time to fill jobs, but it's not anywhere as dramatic as what we're hearing in the media in terms of filling these high-paying manufacturing jobs.

So I'm very pleased to share with you that we delivered record revenue and earnings in the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our outlook. This strength was driven by our disciplined operational execution and our ability to capture the value presented as our solutions become more vital in the modern digital economy.
The supply and demand dynamics in our industry have been well publicized. Broadly speaking, the economic recovery has materialized faster and stronger than initially anticipated, placing unprecedented stress on supply chains globally.
Late last year, ADI moved with speed and agility, proactively making capital investments to add capacity, positioning us to navigate this disruption and better serve our customers. That said, we, like many others in the industry, will face a supply-constrained environment through the balance of 2021. Despite this backdrop, we're positioned for a strong second half as our continued capital investments are aligned with robust demand.
Moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $1.66 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based, highlighted by record quarters for our industrial and automotive markets. Gross margin expanded to nearly 71% and operating margin to approximately 42%. Adjusted EPS of $1.54 increased 43% year-over-year.
Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow. This equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very proud how the ADI team executed this quarter to deliver these impressive results.
At ADI, innovation is the root of how we generate value. And to maintain our virtuous cycle of innovation-driven success, we invest more than $1 billion in R&D annually. This commitment, coupled with the diversity of our business across customers, products and applications, positions us to deliver long-term profitable growth.
Now let me share a few customer highlights with you. ADI's solutions are embedded across the electrification ecosystem, from developing and managing the vehicle battery to the distribution and storage across the digital grid. With the rapid shift to EVs, we're seeing new and increasing investments in battery manufacturing capacity.
This quarter, we secured a design win with the supplier of one of the world's top battery producers. Our innovative solution reduces system costs by half by integrating all measurement, control and diagnostics functions. And our portfolio of wired and wireless BMS provides unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range as we grow and diversify our BMS business. This quarter, we added Volvo as well as 3 additional large auto manufacturers, including a prominent luxury brand in Europe and 2 leading brands in Asia.
Moving on to energy infrastructure. Here, energy storage systems are required to make renewable energy a reality and to build the charging infrastructure to support EV proliferation. Our precision signal chain, power management and BMS portfolios deliver the level of accuracy necessary to ensure consistent supply across the digital grid. We have design wins at more than 80% of the top customers from traditional energy and industrial companies to new entrants.
Another area of increasing importance for ADI is connectivity, which, of course, is becoming more pervasive across demographics and industries, presenting new opportunities for us. For example, in our communications business, we announced a complete radio platform for the 5G O-RAN ecosystem. This radio platform builds on our market-leading integrated transceiver position by expanding into the digital front end. Our full system solution enables significant size and performance improvements while reducing customers' design cycles.
O-RAN represents a new vector of growth in the communications market by enabling new entrants and applications such as private networks that support connected factories. In addition to partnerships with Intel and Marvell, we are working with key carriers and system integrators to enable this ecosystem.
In our space business, our beam-forming solution will be used in Telesat's Lightspeed LEO satellite constellation scheduled to launch in late 2023. This win speaks to the breadth and depth, our RF portfolio and the main expertise at ADI, which is supporting the adoption broadly of LEO communication satellites.
Additionally, we continue to have strong design momentum across our diversified industrial market, the largest, stickiest and most profitable business at ADI. Over the years, we've established a heritage of providing the most precise and efficient solutions required by our factory automation customers. I believe we're at a tipping point in Industry 4.0 as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make supply chains more robust, more efficient and flexible.
We recently won an ultra-high frequency wireless solution at a key automation company. Our solution is being used in advanced robotic systems to reduce downtime and costs. On the wired side, customers are beginning to upgrade to deterministic Ethernet to ensure machines are constantly connected and monitored. This quarter, we secured numerous design wins for our robust Ethernet solution, including 2 of the largest European industrial machine manufacturers.
We recently hosted a deep dive on our instrumentation and test business. This is truly a performance-driven market that requires ADI's most advanced technology and solutions, making it a great fit for our high-performance precision signal chain, power and RF portfolios. Our broad diverse instrumentation business, comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments, is aligned with all secular growth trends across our industry. The increasing complexity of these applications is driving the need for solutions with more advanced technology capabilities. As a result, we expect our SAM to increase by over 20% in the next 5 years.
Now these examples represent only a fraction of the incredible work across ADI. Our team is partnering with our customers every day to develop increasingly innovative technologies that not only create successful business outcomes but also enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world. To that end, I wanted to share an exciting update on how we're leveraging innovation to advance our mission of Engineering Good.
In April, we launched an innovation accelerator with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As part of this program, we'll be combining ADI's engineers and technologies with WHOI's science and technology platforms to continuously monitor critical oceanographic conditions. This effort supports our overall climate agenda, which includes our commitments to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. We also published our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report last week, which provides additional information on how our technologies will continue to play a major role in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health.
So in closing, the last year has underscored how semiconductors, as the bedrock of the modern digital economy and information age, are increasingly important to accelerating digitalization across all industries. We're encouraged by our results this quarter, and the momentum in our pipeline sets the stage for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. So with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth, who'll take you through the financial details."

Good morning, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press relea",891,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a record second quarter as revenue, operating margin and EPS finished above the high end of our outlook. As I mentioned last quarter, upside to our second quarter outlook would be predicated on our ability to increase production. And thanks to early strategic investments in capacity as well as strong execution by our manufacturing operations team, we did just that.
Now let's look at performance by end market. Industrial represented 59% of revenue and increased 14% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. This quarter marks the second consecutive all-time high for industrial. We saw strength across all applications and geographies with all subsegments growing double digits sequentially and year-over-year.
Communications represented 17% of revenue, fell slightly sequentially and was flat year-over-year. Wireline increased double digits year-over-year, which balanced softness in wireless. As we outlined in the last call, 5G builds have been muted year-to-date. However, we anticipate momentum to pick up as 5G deployments broaden globally in the second half of this year, especially in North America now that the C-band auction is complete.
Automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Again, we saw double-digit growth across every major application as industry production has picked up notably from a year ago. BMS grew the fastest, more than doubling year-over-year. And lastly, consumer decreased 12% sequentially in the seasonally weaker second quarter and represented 9% of revenue. Importantly, consumer grew 8% year-over-year, positioning us to deliver growth in fiscal '21.
Now covering the rest of the P&L. Gross margin finished just under 71%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 320 basis points year-over-year on higher utilization and better product mix. We expect additional gross margin expansion in the second half as we realize savings from the consolidation of our manufacturing operations.
OpEx in the quarter was $484 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Merit increases went into effect during the second quarter, and we also recorded higher variable comp due to the strong results. This netted operating margin of 41.7%. Non-op expenses were $44 million, down nearly 10% from the prior year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate was approximately 12%. And all-in adjusted EPS of $1.54 exceeded the high end of our outlook and marks an all-time high.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. Relative to the first quarter, inventory dollars increased $23 million to a record $641 million. This increase was driven entirely by raw material and work in process as we ramped utilization to better meet the strong customer demand. Days of inventory were relatively unchanged at 118. Weeks of channel inventory finished lower sequentially once again. And due to the strong sell-through at our disties, we anticipate remaining below our 7- to 8-week target through the end of the year.
CapEx for the quarter was $59 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $127 million or more than double compared to the second half of 2020. We expect to continue to increase capital investments and for CapEx to trend above our long-term model of 4% this year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, which equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin. And over the same period, we returned approximately 75% of free cash flow after debt repayments via dividends and repos. This is below our long-term target as we paused our buyback program given the pandemic uncertainty and the pending Maxim deal.
We ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet, and our net leverage is now 1.3 on a trailing 12. We're comfortable with the leverage and do not plan to reduce debt. As such, we remain committed to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.
So let me finish up with our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.7 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. This is in line with seasonality after a very strong Q2. At the midpoint, we expect each of our B2B markets to increase slightly sequentially and consumer to be up low double digits. Based on the midpoint of guide, op margin is expected to be 42.5% plus or minus 100 bps, and our tax rate is expected to fall between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.61 plus or minus $0.11.
So in summary, ADI delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record revenue, earnings and free cash flow conversion. Importantly, bookings and backlog remain very strong, and we're continuing to invest to increase production for the balance of the year, giving us great confidence that our second half will be stronger than our first.
We've also made meaningful progress towards closing the Maxim acquisition. Shortly after the deal closes, we are going to hold a conference call to provide an update regarding our capital return plans. As a reminder, once combined, we anticipate having more than $3 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below 1. Let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A."

So we're experiencing significant growth in demand and it's very broad-based, all of our markets. And when you rewind and think how we got here, our customers entered the pandemic with pretty lean inventories, then we had this synchronized government stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. We had very strong growth during the pandemic of consumer electronics with the high use of cloud compute connectivity.
We're coming out of the pandemic now with GDP driving industrial, and that's driving companies to rethink both where they manufacture and upgrading the style by which they manufacture. So on the supply side, we've been planning for additional capacity, as Vince mentioned, since late summer of 2020. And as we add capacity, our revenue forecast is increasing, and that's really what helped us deliver a better Q2 guide, up for Q3 and feel good about Q4.
So I think supply will eventually match demand, but I don't see demand really going away. So this feels -- given the secular drivers behind it, it feels that this is going to be with us for a while. Book-to-bill for the past quarter was above 1 and it was the same for all end markets. So it's again very broad-based. And I think it's really just a reflection of the incredible role that ADI's products play across the manufacturing ecosystem."

We've also put in a noncancelable, nonreturnable for up to 90 days to help give us better visibility into the backlog, and that helps customers sort of manage what they can expect to get from us.

You're seeing that in the Q2 results that printed. You see that in the guide that we've given for Q3. That is coming from the manufacturing consolidation of the Linear factory closure, which we have talked about and also some step-up in utilization.

I would say the -- we've seen really strong acceleration in the automation sector. And I think that's driven by such things as the need for onshoring, more flexibility and more robust and connected supply chains. If I just pick health care, it has already been a multiyear growth market for ADI. And the pandemic kind of underscored the importance of information technology in managing our health care systems. So we've seen an acceleration in our digital health care business as we begin to migrate the hospital environment to the clinic and the home with point-of-care solutions or health care anywhere mentality.
And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, the energy sector, with the move to renewables and this charging infrastructure that's being laid in to support these electric vehicles, those are some of the areas that we're seeing strongest growth within the industrial area.

And after that, in late '22 into 2023, we'll begin to see the upsurge of the wireless battery technology that will complement the wired. So what I believe will happen is today, what have we got, 2 million, 3 million cars per year being produced, electric vehicles being produced. That's going to move to, we believe, somewhere 10x at least over the next 7, 8 years. So this is a multi, multiyear cycle.
We're -- our BMS chips today are being used in over half of the top 10 selling EV cars globally, and we're gaining share in each of those areas. Today, our best position is in North America and China. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're beginning to make real tracks in Europe as well as Japan and Korea. So ultimately, if a manufacturer wants the most miles per charge, they're going to turn to ADI. So that's what we're working on."

India is also -- India has a significant government-funded program to make 5G a reality there. We're beginning to participate in trials.
And last but not least is O-RAN. We already have revenue as a company with Rakuten, the online shopping company in Japan. And we're very well positioned given our ecosystem position there to unlock potential in what is a brand-new stream of revenue, particularly I think, as it gets deployed into private networks for machines."

So I'm not as concerned about the inflation side.
We have been very mindful of the labor side. And I would say that the data we're seeing is that it's taking us about a week longer than normal to fill jobs at the factory level. So our U.S. factories are facing a little bit longer time to fill jobs, but it's not anywhere as dramatic as what we're hearing in the media in terms of filling these high-paying manufacturing jobs.
And then for return to office, that's something we spend a lot of time on. There's no doubt that there will be some return to travel.

So ADI delivered a second consecutive quarter of record revenue and earnings. Despite the challenging supply environment, our strong performance was driven by continued operational excellence and insatiable demand as semiconductors power the modern digital age. 
Broadly speaking, the economic recovery continues to take shape with demand still far exceeding supply. We, like many others in our industry, will face a constrained supply environment into 2022. Despite this backdrop, our business continues to achieve record results as our investments and design wins over the last few years are matched with strong demand across our end markets. So looking ahead, the combination of robust bookings, lean inventories and ongoing capacity additions position ADI to close fiscal '21 on a high note and continue to grow in the next year. 
So moving to our third quarter results. Revenue was $1.76 billion, up 21% year-over-year. All markets increased sequentially with industrial and automotive once again achieving records. Gross margin expanded to over 71% and operating margin to over 43%. Adjusted EPS of $1.72 increased 27% year-over-year. Despite elevated capital spending to increase our capacity, free cash flow over the trailing 12 months was $2.2 billion. This equates to a 34% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. 
As you know, at ADI, our ethos of innovation and deep customer engagements ensure that we stay ahead of what's possible. We invest more than $1 billion annually in R&D, focused on strengthening our core franchises and capturing market opportunities presented by secular growth directors, which have accelerated in the economic recovery. 
Now let me share some recent highlights with you. Our industrial business is our most diverse segment across customers, products and applications and feature sticky, long product life cycles. Our largest industrial segment, instrumentation and test is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments. This is truly a performance-driven market that aligns perfectly to our high-performance precision signal chain, power management and RF portfolios. 
Importantly, instrumentation and test is aligned with all secular growth trends from connectivity to EVs to sustainability. The growing technology complexity of these applications requires more testers with more advanced performance capabilities. Today, ADI is the leader in communications tests, and we're collaborating with Keysight, for example, to advance the development of O-RAN solutions. This partnership will enable the fastest path for designing cost-effective and power-efficient radio units. Looking ahead, we're already beginning to partner with our customers to test emerging 6G technologies. 
Our innovations in the instrumentation market also have a positive impact on human and planetary health. One particular area is our environmental monitoring business, where there is an increased need for highly reliable and accurate instruments to improve the standard of living globally. Our market-leading portfolio of precision converters enables 10x greater measurement resolution of fine particulate matter, better identifying trace pollutions. 
The next largest industrial segment is factory automation. Over the last year, many of our customers are rethinking their factory floors and supply chains to make them more resilient, cost-effective and flexible through automation and connectivity. To achieve this, our customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factories and increase their use of robots and cobots. Specifically, cobots require ADI's precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies and robust wired and wireless connectivity. 
This new vector of growth increases our SAM opportunity by 3x that of a traditional robot. To that end, our precision motion control business is on track for a record year of design business, including a recent win at a leading Japanese robotics company for its next-generation cobots. In addition, we're leveraging our domain knowledge and system-level expertise in a collaboration with Universal Robots to design smaller, smarter and easier-to-use robots that help scale tasks safely and transform workforces. 
Well, turning now to our communications business. 5G is beginning to broaden globally, especially in North America as carriers look to deploy newly acquired C-band spectrum. And O-RAN continues to gain momentum also with several of the largest European carriers setting ambitious 2025 O-RAN deployment targets. This includes Vodafone where our technologies are very well represented. 
This quarter, we extended our market-leading position in 5G radio solutions with the introduction of the industry's first software-defined transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. Our innovative radio architecture greatly improves power efficiency, thereby reducing radio weight, size and carrier expenses. This high level of integration eliminates FPGAs to simplify implementation and facilitate the proliferation of these emerging O-RAN networks. Our next-generation transceiver platform is already designed in at a major Tier 1 global supplier that is gaining share in these 5G and O-RAN deployments across North America as well as Europe. Stepping back, we expect our communications business to return to growth in 2022. We have strong design momentum and our geographic mix has shifted with North America, Europe and Korea representing our largest sources of revenue. 
Moving now on to automotive. Over the last 2 years, we've realigned our business to focus on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. We're seeing the benefits of this strategy as we continue to scale our market leadership in battery management, power management, audio systems and connectivity. 
Starting firstly with our battery management systems, or BMS. Our wired and wireless portfolios provide unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range and can measure all key battery chemistries including 0-cobalt LFP. Additionally, our solutions incorporate ASLD functional safety and an ultra-low power continuous monitoring feature that ensures the battery remains stable even while parked, which is a first in the market. 
In addition, this quarter marked the first time we recognized revenue for our wireless BMS solution as General Motors prepares to ship its first of 30 EV models powered by the Ultium battery platform. And this is just the beginning for this groundbreaking BMS technology as OEMs realize the power of wireless data in scaling their fleets. 
Turning to audio systems and connectivity. As complexity continues to increase, there's very strong demand for our market-leading audio systems with signal processing, A2B connectivity and active road noise cancellation. Our solutions offer the highest fidelity performance in the market while reducing vehicle weight, removing nearly 100 pounds per vehicle. During the quarter, 2 leading OEMs adopted A2B and a top 3 European vehicle manufacturer implemented A2B as its audio connectivity standard across its entire fleet. In total, A2B is now designed in at over 30 OEMs, including 18 of the top 20 global automotive companies. 
Furthermore, interest in our active road noise cancellation feature continues to intensify. We're designed in at 9 OEMs, up from 5 just a year ago, including Hyundai and a leading EV manufacturer. This added capability can more than double the value of our A2B solution. In all, these are just a few of the countless examples of the tremendous work underway at ADI. We remain focused on delivering breakthrough innovations to stay ahead of our customers' needs. 
So in closing, I've never been more confident about ADI's future. Over the last decade, we've built an industry-leading portfolio with unparalleled breadth and depth of capabilities that's aligned with more profitable end markets. And our portfolio and leadership position will only get stronger with the acquisition of Maxim, enabling us to deliver strong returns in the years to come. And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth."

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
ADI delivered exceptional third quarter results, underpinned by our ability to increase production. Revenue and EPS reached all-time highs for the second straight quarter with continued gross and operating margin expansion. If we look at performance by end market, industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased 3% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Notably, this business surpassed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. We experienced broad-based strength across applications and geographies. All subsegments increased double digits year-over-year, except health care, given the elevated pandemic demand a year ago. 
Communications represented 16% of revenue and decreased 21% year-over-year while up 4% sequentially, with growth in both wireless and wireline. As we outlined last quarter, we believe our communications revenue has bottomed and will continue to grow as 5G deployments broaden globally, especially in North America. 
Automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 13% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth across every major application. BMS and A2B remain our fastest-growing applications and both are on track to nearly double in size this year. As Vince shared earlier, ADI has been strategically pivoting resources to focus more aggressively on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. As part of this strategy, we are licensing select radar IP to a large European Tier 1 auto supplier. This resulted in immediate revenue recognition of $24 million in the quarter. 
Consumer represented 10% of revenue and increased 16%, both sequentially and year-over-year. Our strategy to diversify and grow this business in fiscal '21 is working as strength across home entertainment, hearables and wearables more than offset a decline in portables. 
And now moving to the P&L. Gross margin expanded sequentially and year-over-year, finishing at 71.6%, mainly due to the cost savings from the LTC manufacturing optimization and the IP license agreement. OpEx in the quarter was $493 million, up modestly sequentially due to a full quarter of merit increases and continued strong variable comp. This netted an op margin of 43.6%, which marks the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year op margin expansion, underscoring the strong leverage in our business. Non-op expenses were $37 million, below our typical quarterly run rate of approximately [ 43 ] due to an investment gain. And our tax rate was approximately 12%, which give us an adjusted EPS at $1.72, including $0.05 of upside attributable to the IP licensing agreement. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with an ending cash balance of $1.5 billion and a net leverage ratio of 1.2x. Relative to the second quarter, inventory dollars increased $16 million, driven entirely by raw materials and work in process. Days of inventory were unchanged at 118, and weeks of channel inventory remained well below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target as sell-through remained stronger than selling. 
CapEx for the quarter was $86 million, up meaningfully sequentially as we continue to add capacity to support our robust and growing order book that now stretches into fiscal '22. We will continue to increase capacity in the fourth quarter, resulting in full year capital intensity above our long-term model of 4%. 
And turning to free cash flow, we generated more than $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, up 23% from a year ago, and this represented a 34% free cash flow margin. Over the same period, we have returned nearly 85% of free cash flow after debt repayments via $970 million in dividends and over $500 million in share repurchases. 
And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. At the midpoint, excluding the automotive IP licensing revenue, we expect each of our B2B markets to increase sequentially, led by communications and consumer to be up high single digits. Based on the midpoint of guide, we expect to deliver a record gross margin and for operating margins to be 43.7%, plus or minus 100 bps. Our tax rate is expected to fall toward the upper end of our range. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.72, plus or minus $0.11. 
So before moving to the Q&A, I'd like to give a brief update on Maxim. Our discussion with the Chinese regulatory authorities have been productive, and we're working towards closing within the initial time frame. We plan on closing no later than the third business day after China approval has been granted. As we shared before, shortly after the close, we will hold a conference call to provide an update on our capital return plans. Once combined, we anticipate having nearly $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a leverage ratio well below [ 1 ] and more than $3 billion of annual free cash flow. I'll now turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

So that's the foundation. 
It's a highly diverse business. We've got many tens of thousands of customers. And the life cycles in the business are kind of 15 years-plus, and it's a very, very, very sticky set of sockets that we've got. So those of you who have followed ADI for a long time, remember, we -- about a decade ago, we fairly dramatically increased our focus in terms of R&D, go-to-market activities in ensuring that we could really grow that business. And the last few years have shown that we've been gaining market share across the board there. 
So I think there's a certain amount, John, of -- there were a lot of programs that were stalled last year so there's a certain amount of catch-up there. But I do think that the breadth of the portfolio that we now have, the investments we've been making in terms of customer engagement, R&D activities and the secular trends that we've got, all these concurrent secular drivers are propelling that business beyond the market."

Our long-term model is unchanged and that is 70%-plus. So the goal really is to drive the revenue growth and make the trade-offs that are necessary to drive that revenue growth, focusing on delivering on the op margin and the free cash flow. 
So you'll see on a -- if you back out the IP license impact, we had a 71.2% gross margin in the third quarter.

So Toshi, why do I have the confidence I have about 2022 being a strong growth year? So maybe I can unpack that a bit for you.

If you look at then the geographies, North America, the auction, the C-band auction is complete, revenue is really just beginning here. And all the indications are that 5G revenue here will accelerate in 2022 and indeed beyond. 
Europe, I would say, a step behind but we're beginning to see good signs of life in that region. And -- but I think it will be more a late 2022 driver. We've talked several times on various calls here about O-RAN, what's happening but we're beginning to see revenue. We've talked before about Rakuten in Japan. That business continues to accelerate. And European carriers are looking right now to make it also an important part of their 5G offering. 
I mentioned during the prepared remarks as well that Vodafone is a major player there, and we happen to be very well represented in their systems. And I'm also having conversations with customers about the use of 5G and O-RAN beyond the classical consumer market. So it's early days but the characteristics of flexibility, scalability, quicker time to market, cost savings and so on is enabling private networks to be configured in factory environment, for example. So that's all still on to come but that gives you a sense for our confidence in 2022 and beyond."

And then we think about inorganic really more as it helps the technology portfolio or find other ways to help us become more important to customers. But our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to customers. So we are -- we're at a [ 1.2 ] level leverage today. We do not need to reduce debt so on a -- in an environment, despite the confidence that we have in the Maxim deal closing, in an environment where that was not to have happened, would not look for us to really be changing that view of having all our incremental free cash flow go into -- returned to shareholders, either through buyback or through dividend.

Inventory on our balance sheet is up year-over-year and sequentially, but that is exclusively due to raw materials and WIP. We can't keep a finished good in stock, so when it's produced, it either goes to the customer or it goes into the channel and then it goes out of the channel immediately. So we are struggling to build finished goods inventory, both in ADI warehouses as well as in our channel partners. 
Roughly -- well, let's say, a significant amount of our auto business is on consignment, which gives us good visibility for that direct business as to what's happening there. And that is also -- we're seeing that demand kind of pull through pretty quickly and no opportunity for those auto customers to build the inventory within their warehouses, but that's on our books. So it's still very much hand-to-mouth, and the focus that we have, as we've talked throughout this call and in the prepared remarks, is on increasing our capacity or ability to supply by making some significant investments in capacity. I don't see this balance coming into some sense of normalcy until sometime in calendar year '22."

I think the way to answer that would be to say that seasonality in today's environment is a bit of a meaningless concept because revenue growth is really dictated completely by supply. So the print for Q1 is likely to be driven by what more capacity we can get online between the fourth -- over the fourth quarter to allow us. Again, now we've got a couple of things we need to work through in the first quarter that won't -- that would be a little bit of an offset. 
First, there's the holiday season so we do need to adjust factory capacity for that. And consumer, fourth quarter is kind of the key quarter for consumer. That's when they build for the holiday season. So there's always going to be a little bit of seasonality impact for consumer just because of the -- they don't need it in the first quarter or our fiscal first quarter as that is the holiday period. So maybe that's kind of where I'll -- we'll finish, Mike. Anything you want to add to that?"

So ADI delivered a second consecutive quarter of record revenue and earnings. Despite the challenging supply environment, our strong performance was driven by continued operational excellence and insatiable demand as semiconductors power the modern digital age.
Broadly speaking, the economic recovery continues to take shape with demand still far exceeding supply. We, like many others in our industry, will face a constrained supply environment into 2022. Despite this backdrop, our business continues to achieve record results as our investments and design wins over the last few years are matched with strong demand across our end markets. So looking ahead, the combination of robust bookings, lean inventories and ongoing capacity additions position ADI to close fiscal '21 on a high note and continue to grow in the next year. 
So moving to our third quarter results. Revenue was $1.76 billion, up 21% year-over-year. All markets increased sequentially with Industrial and Automotive once again achieving records. Gross margin expanded to over 71% and operating margin to over 43%. Adjusted EPS of $1.72 increased 27% year-over-year. Despite elevated capital spending to increase our capacity, free cash flow over the trailing 12 months was $2.2 billion. This equates to a 34% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. So overall, I'm very pleased with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. 
As you know, at ADI, our ethos of innovation and deep customer engagements ensure that we stay ahead of what's possible. We invest more than $1 billion annually in R&D, focused on strengthening our core franchises and capturing market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers which have accelerated in the economic recovery.
Now let me share some recent highlights with you. Our Industrial business is our most diverse segment across customers, products and applications and feature sticky, long product life cycles. Our largest industrial segment, instrumentation and test, is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments. This is truly a performance-driven market that aligns perfectly to our high-performance precision signal chain, power management and RF portfolios.
Importantly, instrumentation and test is aligned with all secular growth trends from connectivity to EVs, to sustainability. The growing technology complexity of these applications requires more testers with more advanced performance capabilities. 
Today, ADI is the leader in communications tests, and we're collaborating with Keysight, for example, to advance the development of O-RAN solutions. This partnership will enable the fastest path for designing cost-effective and power-efficient radio units. Looking ahead, we're already beginning to partner with our customers to test emerging 6G technologies.
Our innovations in the instrumentation market also have a positive impact on human and planetary health. One particular area is our environmental monitoring business, where there is an increased need for highly reliable and accurate instruments to improve the standard of living globally. Our market-leading portfolio of precision converters enables 10x greater measurement resolution of fine particulate matter, better identifying trace pollutions.
The next largest industrial segment is factory automation. Over the last year, many of our customers are rethinking their factory floors and supply chains to make them more resilient, cost effective and flexible through automation and connectivity. To achieve this, our customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factories and increase their use of robots and cobots. 
Specifically, cobots require ADI's precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies and robust wired and wireless connectivity. This new vector of growth increases our SAM opportunity by 3x that of a traditional robot. To that end, our precision motion control business is on track for a record year of design wins, including a recent win at a leading Japanese robotics company for its next-generation cobots. In addition, we're leveraging our domain knowledge and system-level expertise in a collaboration with Universal Robots to design smaller, smarter and easier-to-use robots that help scale tasks safely and transform workforces. 
Well, turning now to our Communications business. 5G is beginning to broaden globally, especially in North America, as carriers look to deploy newly acquired C-band spectrum. And O-RAN continues to gain momentum also with several of the largest European carriers setting ambitious 2025 O-RAN deployment targets. This includes Vodafone where our technologies are very well represented.
This quarter, we extended our market-leading position in 5G radio solutions with the introduction of the industry's first software-defined transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. Our innovative radio architecture greatly improves power efficiency, thereby reducing radio weight, size and carrier expenses. This high level of integration eliminates FPGAs to simplify implementation and facilitate the proliferation of these emerging O-RAN networks. Our next-generation transceiver platform is already designed in at a major Tier 1 global supplier that is gaining share in these 5G and O-RAN deployments across North America as well as Europe. 
Stepping back, we expect our Communications business to return to growth in 2022. We have strong design momentum, and our geographic mix has shifted with North America, Europe and Korea representing our largest sources of revenue. 
Moving now on to Automotive. Over the last 2 years, we've realigned our business to focus on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. We're seeing the benefits of this strategy as we continue to scale our market leadership in battery management, power management, audio systems and connectivity.
Starting firstly with our battery management systems, or BMS. Our wired and wireless portfolios provide unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range and can measure all key battery chemistries, including zero-Cobalt LFP. Additionally, our solutions incorporate ASIL-D functional safety and an ultra-low power continuous monitoring feature that ensures the battery remains stable even while parked, which is a first in the market.
In addition, this quarter marked the first time we recognize revenue for our wireless BMS solution as General Motors prepares to ship its first of 30 EV models powered by the Ultium battery platform. And this is just the beginning for this groundbreaking BMS technology as OEMs realize the power of wireless data in scaling their fleets. 
Turning to audio systems and connectivity. As complexity continues to increase, there's very strong demand for our market-leading audio systems with signal processing, A2B connectivity and active road noise cancellation. Our solutions offer the highest fidelity performance in the market while reducing vehicle weight, removing nearly 100 pounds per vehicle. 
During the quarter, 2 leading OEMs adopted A2B, and a top 3 European vehicle manufacturer implemented A2B as its audio connectivity standard across its entire fleet. In total, A2B is now designed in at over 30 OEMs, including 18 of the top 20 global automotive companies. Furthermore, interest in our active road noise cancellation feature continues to intensify. We're designed in at 9 OEMs, up from 5 just a year ago, including Hyundai and a leading EV manufacturer. This added capability can more than double the value of our A2B solution. 
In all, these are just a few of the countless examples of the tremendous work underway at ADI. We remain focused on delivering breakthrough innovations to stay ahead of our customers' needs. 
So in closing, I've never been more confident about ADI's future. Over the last decade, we've built an industry-leading portfolio with unparalleled breadth and depth of capabilities that's aligned with more profitable end markets. And our portfolio and leadership position will only get stronger with the acquisition of Maxim, enabling us to deliver strong returns in the years to come. 
And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth."

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
ADI delivered exceptional third quarter results, underpinned by our ability to increase production. Revenue and EPS reached all-time highs for the second straight quarter with continued gross and operating margin expansion. If we look at performance by end market, Industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased 3% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Notably, this business surpassed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. We experienced broad-based strength across applications and geographies. All subsegments increased double digits year-over-year, except health care, given the elevated pandemic demand a year ago. 
Communications represented 16% of revenue and decreased 21% year-over-year while up 4% sequentially with growth in both wireless and wireline. As we outlined last quarter, we believe our Communications revenue has bottomed and will continue to grow as 5G deployments broaden globally, especially in North America. 
Automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 13% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth across every major application. BMS and A2B remain our fastest-growing applications, and both are on track to nearly double in size this year. As Vince shared earlier, ADI has been strategically pivoting resources to focus more aggressively on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. As part of this strategy, we are licensing select radar IP to a large European Tier 1 auto supplier. This resulted in immediate revenue recognition of $24 million in the quarter.
Consumer represented 10% of revenue and increased 16%, both sequentially and year-over-year. Our strategy to diversify and grow this business in fiscal '21 is working as strength across home entertainment, hearables and wearables more than offset a decline in portables. 
And now moving to the P&L. Gross margin expanded sequentially and year-over-year, finishing at 71.6%, mainly due to the cost savings from the LTC manufacturing optimization and the IP license agreement. OpEx in the quarter was $493 million, up modestly sequentially, due to a full quarter of merit increases and continued strong variable comp. This netted an op margin of 43.6%, which marks the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year op margin expansion, underscoring the strong leverage in our business. Non-op expenses were $37 million, below our typical quarterly run rate of approximately $43 million due to an investment gain. And our tax rate was approximately 12%, which give us an adjusted EPS at $1.72, including $0.05 of upside attributable to the IP licensing agreement. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with an ending cash balance of $1.5 billion and a net leverage ratio of 1.2x. Relative to the second quarter, inventory dollars increased $16 million, driven entirely by raw materials and work in process. Days of inventory were unchanged at 118, and weeks of channel inventory remained well below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target as sell-through remained stronger than selling. CapEx for the quarter was $86 million, up meaningfully sequentially as we continue to add capacity to support our robust and growing order book that now stretches into fiscal '22. We will continue to increase capacity in the fourth quarter, resulting in full year capital intensity above our long-term model of 4%. 
And turning to free cash flow, we generated more than $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, up 23% from a year ago, and this represented a 34% free cash flow margin. Over the same period, we have returned nearly 85% of free cash flow after debt repayment via $970 million in dividends and over $500 million in share repurchases. 
And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially, as additional capacity comes online. At the midpoint, excluding the automotive IP licensing revenue, we expect each of our B2B markets to increase sequentially, led by Communications and Consumer to be up high single digits. Based on the midpoint of guide, we expect to deliver a record gross margin and for operating margins to be 43.7%, plus or minus 100 bps. Our tax rate is expected to fall toward the upper end of our range. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.72, plus or minus $0.11. 
So before moving to the Q&A, I'd like to give a brief update on Maxim. Our discussions with the Chinese regulatory authorities have been productive, and we're working towards closing within the initial time frame. We plan on closing no later than the third business day after China approval has been granted. As we shared before, shortly after the close, we will hold a conference call to provide an update on our capital return plans. Once combined, we anticipate having nearly $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a leverage ratio well below 1 and more than $3 billion of annual free cash flow. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

So that's the foundation. It's a highly diverse business. We've got many tens of thousands of customers. And the life cycles in the business are kind of 15 years plus, and it's a very, very, very sticky set of sockets that we've got. 
So those of you who have followed ADI for a long time, remember, we -- about a decade ago, we fairly dramatically increased our focus in terms of R&D, go-to-market activities in ensuring that we could really grow that business. And the last few years have shown that we've been gaining market share across the board there. 
So I think there's a certain amount, John, of -- there were a lot of programs that were stalled last year, so there's a certain amount of catch-up there.

We're passing on cost increase so that we're not impacting margins, but we've made a decision not to take advantage of our customers by structurally increasing pricing in this environment. Our long-term model is unchanged, and that is 70% plus. So the goal really is to drive the revenue growth and make the trade-offs that are necessary to drive that revenue growth, focusing on delivering on the op margin and the free cash flow. 
So you'll see on a -- if you back out the IP license impact, we had a 71.2% gross margin in the third quarter. And while we don't guide to gross margins, if you impute it from the guide that we give you -- we gave you, fourth quarter is going to be -- probably be a record for ADI in terms of gross margins."

We delivered that in third quarter, and we are on track to deliver that for the fourth quarter. So we believe we're really well positioned for strong growth into fiscal '22. 
And between kind of the 2 subsegments there, wired demand remains strong, and we expect that to continue as both carriers and data centers continue to do the upgrades to their networks. And wireless, while it's always lumpy, growth in the past quarter was really driven by rest of the world, North America.

So Toshi, why do I have the confidence I have about 2022 being a strong growth year? So maybe I can unpack that a bit for you. So I think our Comms revenue mix is seeing a benefit from the rest of world beginning to emerge in 5G. So today, rest of world, outside of China, is 3x in terms of TAM. So that's number one. If you look at then the geographies, North America, the auction, the C-band auction is complete, revenue is really just beginning here. And all the indications are that 5G revenue here will accelerate in 2022 and indeed beyond. Europe, I would say a step behind, but we're beginning to see good signs of life in that region. And -- but I think it will be more a late 2022 driver. 
We've talked several times on various calls here about O-RAN, what's happening, but we're beginning to see revenue. We've talked before about Rakuten in Japan. That business continues to accelerate, and European carriers are looking right now to make it also an important part of their 5G offering. 
I mentioned during the prepared remarks as well that Vodafone is a major player there, and we happen to be very well represented in their systems. And I'm also having conversations with customers about the use of 5G and O-RAN beyond the classical consumer market. 
So it's early days, but the characteristics of flexibility, scalability, quicker time to market, cost savings and so on is enabling private networks to be configured in factory environments, for example. So that's all still on to come, but that gives you a sense for our confidence in 2022 and beyond."

And then we think about inorganic really more as it helps the technology portfolio or find other ways to help us become more important to customers. 
But our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to customers. So we're at a 1.2 level leverage today. We do not need to reduce debt. So on a -- in an environment -- despite the confidence that we have in the Maxim deal closing, in an environment where that was not to have happened, would not look for us to really be changing that view of having all our incremental free cash flow go into -- returned to shareholders, either through buyback or through dividend. 
And as a reminder, I think over the past 3 years, we've averaged about a 10% increase in our dividend, so a very healthy commitment for our fixed income-focused investors as well as the repo. I think we're on track this year for an all-time high in terms of our repo activity.

Again, now we've got a couple of things we need to work through in the first quarter that won't -- that would be a little bit of an offset. 
First, there's the holiday season, so we do need to adjust factory capacity for that. And Consumer, fourth quarter is kind of the key quarter for Consumer. That's when they build for the holiday season. So there's always going to be a little bit of seasonality impact for Consumer, just because of the -- they don't need it in the first quarter or our fiscal first quarter as that is the holiday period.

Well, once again, we delivered record revenue and profits in our fourth quarter, closing out what was a milestone year for ADI. Our success was driven by our industry-leading high-performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution, enabling us to better meet the insatiable demand for our products. 
Now stepping back a little. 2021 truly demonstrated the vital importance of semiconductors to the modern digital age. We invested ahead of this inflection, building a comprehensive portfolio to better solve our customers' most complex problems, in this ubiquitously sensed and connected world. 
As we enter 2022, our backlog and bookings remain robust. And we continue to invest in manufacturing capacity, positioning us well for another successful year ahead. Now moving on to our results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $2.34 billion and EPS was $1.73, both exceeding the midpoint of guidance. And for 2021, our revenue was $7.32 billion, and EPS was $6.46. 
Looking at our organic ADI. We delivered new high watermarks on revenue and profits. Industrial and automotive achieved record revenue this year, while consumer returns to annual growth for the first time since 2017, and communications revenue declined its continued strength in wired was offset by weakness in wireless related to the China market. 
In 2021, we generated a record $2.4 billion of free cash flow, equating to a free cash flow margin of approximately 33%. This maintains our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. In line with our revised capital allocation strategy to return 100% of free cash flow, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share buybacks. 
It was not only a record year for performance and shareholder returns, but also for investments that position us to better capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers in our business. First, we took decisive action to add capacity throughout the year with more than $340 million in capital expenditures. 
This is enabling us to better navigate the near-term supply/demand imbalance while achieving our long-term growth objectives. And in 2022, we're planning to expand our internal manufacturing capacity at our factories in the U.S. and Europe. These additional investments will create more profitable, flexible and resilient manufacturing capabilities at ADI. 
Now at our core, we're an innovation-driven enterprise. And together with Maxim, we will invest more than $1.6 billion in R&D annually to ensure we continue developing solutions that define the edge of possible. As you know, to complement our organic efforts, we selectively use M&A to expand both our scale and our scope. 
In 2017, the acquisition of LTC reflected this strategy. Since acquiring the franchise, we delivered on our goal to double its historical growth rate. Equally impressive was our ability to improve on Linear's industry-leading gross margins. 
More recently, we completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated. Similar to previous acquisitions, we're combining the best from ADI and Maxim to develop a new operating system that enhances customer engagement and drives long-term profitable growth. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made already. 
On the customer engagement side, the integration of our field teams has brought a tremendous degree of excitement. The team is already beginning to identify cross-selling opportunities and building out our opportunity pipeline. From an engineering and operations perspective, our teams are coming together at a remarkable speed, and we're aligning product and technology road maps to help accelerate growth in the years ahead. 
This combination also strengthens the diversity of our portfolio and enriches our resilient business model. To that end, we now have approximately 75,000 product SKUs and 80% of these products individually account for less than 0.1% of our total revenue. And the addition of Maxim provides us with a more comprehensive power portfolio, Maxim's primarily application-focused power offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. 
This adds new SAM in all our markets and enhances cross-selling opportunities, accelerating revenue growth in our $2 billion-plus power portfolio. Given these investments, we entered 2022 with an unparalleled portfolio of technology and talent aimed at capitalizing on the secular growth trends across all our markets. And now I'd like to share a few examples of how our business is at the heart of these emerging trends, starting with industrial. 
2021 was a better year for our highly diversified and profitable industrial business with all applications achieving all-time highs. Our unrivaled high-performance portfolio continues to benefit from the mass digitalization movement across industries. Our largest industrial segment, instrumentation and test is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments. 
These applications must combat increasing test times as system complexity and metrology requirements rise exponentially. For example, processors and memory and data centers are leveraging finer node geometries with higher levels of integration, which can double the test time. This challenge is our opportunity. 
Our innovative, purpose-built solutions are bringing test time back to parity while increasing our content by more than 50%. Factory automation is one of our largest industrial segments. I believe we're at a tipping point in the Industry 4.0 as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make their supply chains more robust, efficient and, of course, flexible. 
ADI's precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies and robust wired and wireless connectivity are critical to enabling these efforts. Looking ahead, we have an enormous opportunity to connect Maxim's rich power portfolio, which is underrepresented in the industrial sector today with ADI's strong position. 
Shifting now to automotive. In a year dominated by chip shortage headlines, we achieved record revenue as consumers and manufacturers are embracing electric vehicles and an enhanced in-vehicle experience. These 2 areas need additional semiconductor content and align very well with the strengths of both ADI and Maxim. 
In electric vehicles, our market-leading wired and wireless battery management systems, or BMS, offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability and safety as well as flexibility to scale across all battery chemistries, including the more environmentally friendly 0 cobalt LFP. 
Our BMS position is further strengthened with Maxim. We now sell to 7 of the top 10 EV manufacturers and our increased technology and product scale enables us to address new SAM. Our efficiency is also critical in electric vehicles to better optimize performance and range. Here, Maxim's strong and growing power management capabilities complement our portfolio. 
Now inside the vehicle, automakers are enhancing the in-cabin experience. ADI's market-leading audio systems with signal processing, A2B connectivity and active road noise cancellation continues to gain traction. In 2021, our A2B franchise was designed in at 5 major OEMs. And since its launch in 2016, we've shipped over 50 million A2B nodes, and we expect this to double within the next 3 years. 
With Maxim, our in-cabin connectivity offerings expand to include their industry-leading GMSL franchise, which is critical in architecting advanced driver-assistance systems. Turning to communications. 2021 was an uneven year as strength in wired was offset by weakness in the China wireless market. Encouragingly, as we look to 2022, the proliferation of 5G is gaining momentum globally, especially in North America. 
In the wireless market, ADI is the leader with more than double the market share of our closest competitor. This year, we introduced the industry's first software-defined radio transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. This next-generation transceiver platform enables us to defend and extend our position in traditional 5G and emerging O-RAN networks. Additionally, Maxim's power portfolio will support our goal to increase our power attach rate in the wireless market. 
In our wired business, we grew again this year as data centers and networking became increasingly vital to accelerating digitalization. Maxim more than doubles our exposure to data centers and adds new growth vectors with its power management solutions for cloud processors and accelerators, and momentum is building with a strong pipeline across traditional customers as well as hyperscalers. 
Finally, moving on to consumer. Our business delivered double-digit growth this year as we executed on our strategy to diversify our customers' products and applications. Maxim further builds in these efforts, bringing additional power, audio and sensing capabilities and adding new applications like fast charging and gaming. Given the strong pipeline and design wins for our signal processing solutions across hearables, wearables and professional audio video, combined with our power management capabilities, I'm confident that we're on the path for continued growth. 
Now I'd like to focus on ESG just a little, which is now an integral part of our business strategy. Broadly speaking, I believe semiconductors can play a major role in improving our standard of living while also protecting our planetary health. For example, ADI's technology is critical to optimizing global energy efficiency from EVs and charging stations; two, sustainable energy and smart grids. We're not only investing in these applications, but they represent a meaningful and growing portion of ADI's revenue today. So we've made substantial progress on our ESG initiatives in 2021, including a commitment to increase the use of sustainable energy for 100% of our organic ADI manufacturing activities by 2025, up from 50% today. 
Actions like these will help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 and net 0 emissions by 2050. We launched the Ocean and Climate Innovation Accelerator Consortium focused on the critical role of oceans in combating climate change. And we've enhanced our disclosure and transparency in ESG topics, especially around diversity, equity and inclusion. In the year ahead, we look to extend our ESG initiatives across the combined company and, of course, make further progress toward our goals. 
So in closing, I'd like to thank our employees and partners who worked tirelessly throughout this past year, helping ADI achieve these historic results. We're off to a strong start in 2022 with continued robust demand and line of sight to capacity additions. And I've never been more optimistic about ADI's future. Our industry-leading position is stronger with Maxim as we expand our capabilities to capitalize on emerging secular drivers positioning us for faster growth in the years ahead. 
And with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth."

Except for revenue, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Also, the acquisition of Maxim closed on August 26. As such, I will discuss results inclusive of Maxim's contributions for approximately 9.5 weeks. I'll begin with a brief review of 2021. We delivered sequential revenue growth every quarter, leading to a new all-time high of $7.32 billion. Gross margins of 70.9% increased 180 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and the savings from our legacy LTC plant optimization. 
Operating margins of 42.4% increased 250 basis points, reflecting gross margin fall-through and disciplined discretionary spending. All told, adjusted EPS increased more than 30% to a record $6.46.  Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $2.34 billion exceeded the midpoint of our updated guidance. Maxim's contribution to revenue was $559 million. 
Looking at the end market results and to give a better view into the underlying trends, I'll focus my remarks on organic ADI results. But this will be the last earnings call where we provide ADI organic commentary. Industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased slightly sequentially and 25% year-over-year with growth across every subsegment. For the full year, industrial increased 28%. This strong performance once again, is a testament to our sustained relative outperformance in the industrial market. 
Communications represented 16% of revenue and was flat sequentially, while decreasing year-over-year. For the year, we delivered record wired sales, while total comps declined due to the weakness in China wireless, largely related to geopolitical tensions. Excluding this region, total comps grew more than 20% in 2021. And overall, our comms geographic mix shifted with North America, Europe and Korea, now representing our largest sources of revenue. 
Automotive represented 15% of revenue and was down 9% sequentially as the third quarter included revenue from an IP licensing agreement. Excluding this, auto was flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, auto increased 15% with BMS more than doubling, reflecting our leadership position in the electrification ecosystem. For the year, auto exhibited robust broad-based growth, finishing up 36%. Consumer represented 12% of revenue and increased more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of annual growth. 
Over a year ago, we said consumer would grow in 2021 and the team delivered on this commitment with consumer increasing 12% for the year. Moving on to the rest of the fourth quarter P&L. I'm going to speak to the results inclusive of the partial quarter of Maxim. Gross margins were 70.9%, up 90 bps year-over-year. Operating margins finished at 43.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Nonop expense was $44 million and the tax rate was 12.7%. 
All in, adjusted EPS was $1.73 above the midpoint of guide and up more than 20% year-over-year. If we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and equivalents and on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 turns. Building on our ESG efforts, we continue to strategically leverage sustainable financing. We're proud to be the first U.S. tech company to deploy 3 sustainable finance instruments with our inaugural green bond issuance, a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility and a sustainability linked to bond offering. 
Specifically, this bond offering was part of our $4 billion refinancing efforts during the quarter. And as a result, we lowered our weighted average coupon to 2.7% while extending the average duration of our total debt by nearly 10 years. 
Inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially after adjusting for the partial quarter of Maxim activity and the fair value step-up of inventory related to the acquisition.  While inventory days were down slightly. Channel inventory declined and remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target. 
Moving to the cash flow statement. For the year, cash flow from operations increased 36% to more than $2.7 billion. We generated a record free cash flow of $2.4 billion or approximately 33% of revenue despite CapEx more than doubling to $344 million or 4.7% of revenue. We also returned a record $3.7 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow to shareholders this year by dividends and buybacks, including 80% of our $2.5 billion ASR program. 
As a reminder, we plan to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. This is accomplished by growing our dividend annually with a 40% to 60% dividend payout target and by using residual cash flow for buybacks. We entered 2022 as a much larger enterprise with an attractive long-term outlook. As Vince mentioned, we plan to increase our capacity investments to support revenue growth and reinforce the resiliency and efficiency of our hybrid manufacturing model. 
As such, we anticipate CapEx being 6% to 8% of revenue for 2022 above our long-term model of 4%. This step-up in CapEx will not impact the commitment we made in September to buy back 5 billion of shares by the end of calendar '22.  So now on to the first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Based on the midpoint, we expect operating margin to be 43.3 plus or minus 70 bps. We expect nonop expenses of approximately $50 million, a 12.5% tax rate and a share count of approximately 530 million. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.78 plus or minus $0.10. 
For additional context, using the fourth quarter pro forma combined revenue as a base, our guide at the midpoint implies low single-digit growth quarter-on-quarter in Q1 for what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter. This growth is driven by an increase in B2B quarter-over-quarter, while consumer is down sequentially. 
So before closing, I want to give a brief update on our Maxim integration progress. Phase 1 of shareholder value creation is well underway, building conviction in our cost synergy timeline. We anticipate realizing over 40% of the initial $275 million OpEx and COGS synergy target in fiscal '22 with the remaining coming in fiscal '23. 
I'm proud of the team's effort and confident this pace of execution will continue. At our Analyst Day next spring, we'll update investors on our progress as well as provide more details on Phases 2 and 3, which relate to additional savings from infrastructure optimization and revenue synergies, respectively. 
Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to congratulate Michael Lucarelli on his promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Look forward to working with you, Mike in this continued partnership. Let me hand it over to you to take Q&A."

Why don't I take pricing, and I'll let Vince kind of speak how we think about it longer term. So in the -- the short answer is, for 2021, we've been talking about rising cost inflation over the course of the year, and we've been raising our prices with the goal of neutralizing the impact to margin. I would say that in the fiscal year that just finished, cost increases and price increases were not completely synchronized. 
So it's very likely that cost inflation outpaced our pricing actions for the year, and we're likely a modest headwind to the year. As we go into 2022, we're looking for the inverse of that. We're looking for pricing net of inflation to be a modest tailwind to the year as the price increases that have begun -- begin to get more traction. And we believe that while we still will have some cost increases over the course of the year, most of those are now baked into the run rate."

And we also maintain products for our customers that are often more than 20 years in 20 years old in vintage terms. 
We've taken a very measured approach to pricing over the last year. And we've been very transparent with our customers as well that price increases are really more about passing on costs rather than looking to enhancing our margins. Last comment on pricing. I think the industry, as we approach this kind of post-Moore's Law era, we're in an era now, I believe, of structural price increases rather than cyclical. 
In other words, I think you'll start to see inflation sustained for the industry in the years ahead. It's been proven over the last couple of years for certain that semis are the roots of the modern digital economy. And I think customers understand as well that importance and the value that is increasingly created by semi. So I believe that, as I said, inflation will persist. It will moderate, but I think it's a facet now of the business structure of the semi industry and indeed ADI's business."

Half our business, total business is industrial, and it's a very, very small part of Maxim's business. 
And where I see the opportunity there is really on the power side of things, power management, in particular. It's the fastest-growing segment in the Analog space. And I think generally, across the board, we're still underrepresented as a company in power. We will -- we today have approximately $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion of combined power revenues. 
My sense is we can double that in a reasonable period of time. And we'll give a lot more detail on that when we get to the Investor Day over the next couple of months. And from an application and market standpoint, I'd just like to point to data center. You know the power management solutions that Maxim has for companionship with cloud processors, AI machines, accelerators and so on. I think we'll combine very nicely with ADI's data center micromodules. 
And then in automotive, connectivity, Maxim's GMSL high-speed link technology used in our in-cabin connectivity portfolio will enable us to optimize solutions and address a lot more applications in the car. And that's a nice companion as well to ADI's A2B connectivity solution for audio. 
And last but not least, Maxim has added a lot of heft to our BMS portfolio. And our portfolio now is double the size it was pre Maxim. So -- and as I mentioned in -- again, in the prepared remarks, we now sell 7 out of the top 10 OEMs in the electric car area.

We're seeing broad-based demand continue. I think also, we're seeing some improvement, generally speaking. With each passing month, we're seeing improvements in supply. So I think that line of sight gives us increased confidence. That's both internally as well as externally. 
We are in catch up more than pricing. So I think you'll see some significant contribution in 2022 from pricing activities. And also, inventories continue to remain low in the distribution channel and, of course, on the customer side pretty much on a broad basis. So I think overall, '22 should shape up to be a good year.

So given the long lead times from the semi-cap guys, we're probably unlikely to see a meaningful increase in Maxim's ability to supply until the tail end of the year. So unfortunately, I think Maxim from a fiscal year basis will probably be a little bit of a drag on growth just because we can't get the tools fast enough."

The customer on customer buying behavior, book-to-bill is well above 1 in the fourth quarter. So our outlook to grow quarter-on-quarter for the first quarter in what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter as a reference to that. Our backlog increased, and we're starting 2022 with a very high level, and we have not seen much change in cancellations or pushouts. 
So we're continuing to do what we have been doing, and that is we're reviewing with sales and ops for red flags that would indicate there's some level of turning in the market. We haven't seen anything notable. Really, it's pretty strong across all end markets and all geographies. And as we've said before, we manage our business on sell-through. So we really look through distribution to get insight from where our products are going on a sell-through basis to understand what's happening in terms of who's buying and where it's being shipped to. So we're prepared for things to change. But I would say right now, it continues to feel as it did a quarter ago."

The internal inventory balance was up as we built raw materials and WIP. 
You have some noise in there from Maxim's inventory being added into our middle of the quarter as well as the purchase accounting math, which requires us to do a step up of that. So adjusting for all of that, we were up slightly in terms of ADI balance sheet inventory, and most of that was in WIP.

Well, once again, we delivered record revenue and profits in our fourth quarter, closing out what was a milestone year for ADI. Our success was driven by our industry-leading high-performance",1695,"Thank you very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Well, once again, we delivered record revenue and profits in our fourth quarter, closing out what was a milestone year for ADI. Our success was driven by our industry-leading high-performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution, enabling us to better meet the insatiable demand for our products.  
Now stepping back a little. 2021 truly demonstrated the vital importance of semiconductors to the modern digital age. We invested ahead of this inflection, building a comprehensive portfolio to better solve our customers' most complex problems in this ubiquitously sensed and connected world. As we enter 2022, our backlog and bookings remain robust. And we continue to invest in manufacturing capacity, positioning us well for another successful year ahead. 
Now moving on to our results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $2.34 billion and EPS was $1.73, both exceeding the midpoint of guidance. And for 2021, our revenue was $7.32 billion, and EPS was $6.46.  
Looking at our organic ADI. We delivered new high watermarks on revenue and profits. Industrial and Automotive achieved record revenue this year, while Consumer returns to annual growth for the first time since 2017, and Communications revenue declined as continued strength in wired was offset by weakness in wireless related to the China market.  
In 2021, we generated a record $2.4 billion of free cash flow, equating to a free cash flow margin of approximately 33%. This maintains our position in the top 10% of the S&P 500. In line with our revised capital allocation strategy to return 100% of free cash flow, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share buybacks.  
It was not only a record year for performance and shareholder returns, but also for investments that position us to better capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers in our business. First, we took decisive action to add capacity throughout the year with more than $340 million in capital expenditures.  
This is enabling us to better navigate the near-term supply/demand imbalance while achieving our long-term growth objectives. And in 2022, we're planning to expand our internal manufacturing capacity at our factories in the U.S. and Europe. These additional investments will create more profitable, flexible and resilient manufacturing capabilities at ADI.  
Now at our core, we're an innovation-driven enterprise. And together with Maxim, we will invest more than $1.6 billion in R&D annually to ensure we continue developing solutions that define the edge of possible. As you know, to complement our organic efforts, we selectively use M&A to expand both our scale and our scope. In 2017, the acquisition of LTC reflected this strategy. Since acquiring the franchise, we delivered on our goal to double its historical growth rate. Equally impressive was our ability to improve on Linear's industry-leading gross margins.  
More recently, we completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated. Similar to previous acquisitions, we're combining the best from ADI and Maxim to develop a new operating system that enhances customer engagement and drives long-term profitable growth. And I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made already.  
On the customer engagement side, the integration of our field teams has brought a tremendous degree of excitement. The team is already beginning to identify cross-selling opportunities and building out our opportunity pipeline. From an engineering and operations perspective, our teams are coming together at a remarkable speed, and we're aligning product and technology road maps to help accelerate growth in the years ahead.  
This combination also strengthens the diversity of our portfolio and enriches our resilient business model. To that end, we now have approximately 75,000 product SKUs, and 80% of these products individually account for less than 0.1% of our total revenue. And the addition of Maxim provides us with a more comprehensive power portfolio. Maxim's primarily application-focused power offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio.  
This adds new SAM in all our markets and enhances cross-selling opportunities, accelerating revenue growth in our $2 billion-plus power portfolio. Given these investments, we entered 2022 with an unparalleled portfolio of technology and talent aimed at capitalizing on the secular growth trends across all our markets. 
And now I'd like to share a few examples of how our business is at the heart of these emerging trends, starting with industrial. 2021 was a better year for our highly diversified and profitable industrial business with all applications achieving all-time highs. Our unrivaled high-performance portfolio continues to benefit from the mass digitalization movement across industries. Our largest industrial segment, instrumentation and test, is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments.  
These applications must combat increasing test times as system complexity and metrology requirements rise exponentially. For example, processors and memory and data centers are leveraging finer node geometries with higher levels of integration, which can double the test time. This challenge is our opportunity.  
Our innovative, purpose-built solutions are bringing test time back to parity while increasing our content by more than 50%. Factory automation is one of our largest industrial segments. I believe we're at a tipping point in the Industry 4.0 as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make their supply chains more robust, efficient and, of course, flexible.  
ADI's precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies and robust wired and wireless connectivity are critical to enabling these efforts. Looking ahead, we have an enormous opportunity to connect Maxim's rich power portfolio, which is underrepresented in the industrial sector today with ADI's strong position.  
Shifting now to Automotive. In a year dominated by chip shortage headlines, we achieved record revenue as consumers and manufacturers are embracing electric vehicles and an enhanced in-vehicle experience. These 2 areas need additional semiconductor content and align very well with the strengths of both ADI and Maxim. In electric vehicles, our market-leading wired and wireless battery management systems of BMS offered customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability and safety as well as flexibility to scale across all battery chemistries, including the more environmentally-friendly zero-Cobalt LFP.  
Our BMS position is further strengthened with Maxim. We now sell to 7 of the top 10 EV manufacturers and our increased technology and product scale enables us to address new SAM. Our efficiency is also critical in electric vehicles to better optimize performance and range. Here, Maxim's strong and growing power management capabilities complement our portfolio.  
Now inside the vehicle, automakers are enhancing the in-cabin experience. ADI's market-leading audio systems with signal processing, A2B connectivity and active road noise cancellation continues to gain traction. In 2021, our A2B franchise was designed in at 5 major OEMs. And since its launch in 2016, we've shipped over 50 million A2B nodes, and we expect this to double within the next 3 years.  
With Maxim, our in-cabin connectivity offerings expand to include their industry-leading GMSL franchise, which is critical in architecting advanced driver-assistance systems. 
Turning to Communications. 2021 was an uneven year as strength in wired was offset by weakness in the China wireless market. Encouragingly, as we look to 2022, the proliferation of 5G is gaining momentum globally, especially in North America.  
In the wireless market, ADI is the leader with more than double the market share of our closest competitor. This year, we introduced the industry's first software-defined radio transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. This next-generation transceiver platform enables us to defend and extend our position in traditional 5G and emerging O-RAN networks. Additionally, Maxim's power portfolio will support our goal to increase our power attach rate in the wireless market.  
In our wired business, we grew again this year as data centers and networking became increasingly vital to accelerating digitalization. Maxim more than doubles our exposure to data centers and adds new growth vectors with its power management solutions for cloud processors and accelerators, and momentum is building with a strong pipeline across traditional customers as well as hyperscalers.  
Finally, moving on to Consumer. Our business delivered double-digit growth this year as we executed on our strategy to diversify our customers' products and applications. Maxim further builds in these efforts, bringing additional power, audio and sensing capabilities and adding new applications like fast-charging and gaming. Given the strong pipeline and design wins for our signal processing solutions across hearables, wearables and professional audio/video, combined with our power management capabilities, I'm confident that we're on the path for continued growth.  
Now I'd like to focus on ESG just a little, which is now an integral part of our business strategy. Broadly speaking, I believe semiconductors can play a major role in improving our standard of living while also protecting our planetary health. For example, ADI's technology is critical to optimizing global energy efficiency from EVs and charging stations; two, sustainable energy and smart grids. We're not only investing in these applications, but they represent a meaningful and growing portion of ADI's revenue today. So we've made substantial progress on our ESG initiatives in 2021, including a commitment to increase the use of sustainable energy for 100% of our organic ADI manufacturing activities by 2025, up from 50% today.  
Actions like these will help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. We launched the Ocean and Climate Innovation Accelerator Consortium focused on the critical role of oceans in combating climate change. And we've enhanced our disclosure and transparency in ESG topics, especially around diversity, equity and inclusion. In the year ahead, we look to extend our ESG initiatives across the combined company and, of course, make further progress toward our goals.  
So in closing, I'd like to thank our employees and partners who worked tirelessly throughout this past year, helping ADI achieve these historic results. We're off to a strong start in 2022 with continued robust demand and line of sight to capacity additions. And I've never been more optimistic about ADI's future. Our industry-leading position is stronger with Maxim as we expand our capabilities to capitalize on emerging secular drivers positioning us for faster growth in the years ahead.  
And with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth."

Except for revenue, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.  
Also, the acquisition of Maxim closed on August 26. As such, I will discuss results inclusive of Maxim's contributions for approximately 9.5 weeks. I'll begin with a brief review of 2021. We delivered sequential revenue growth every quarter, leading to a new all-time high of $7.32 billion. Gross margins of 70.9% increased 180 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and the savings from our legacy LTC plant optimization.  
Operating margins of 42.4% increased 250 basis points, reflecting gross margin fall-through and disciplined discretionary spending. All told, adjusted EPS increased more than 30% to a record $6.46.  Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $2.34 billion exceeded the midpoint of our updated guidance. Maxim's contribution to revenue was $559 million.  
Looking at the end market results and to give a better view into the underlying trends, I'll focus my remarks on organic ADI results. But this will be the last earnings call where we provide ADI organic commentary. Industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased slightly sequentially and 25% year-over-year with growth across every subsegment. For the full year, industrial increased 28%. This strong performance, once again, is a testament to our sustained relative outperformance in the industrial market.  
Communications represented 16% of revenue and was flat sequentially, while decreasing year-over-year. For the year, we delivered record wired sales, while total comps declined due to the weakness in China wireless, largely related to geopolitical tensions. Excluding this region, total comps grew more than 20% in 2021. And overall, our comms geographic mix shifted with North America, Europe and Korea, now representing our largest sources of revenue.  
Automotive represented 15% of revenue and was down 9% sequentially as the third quarter included revenue from an IP licensing agreement. Excluding this, auto was flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, auto increased 15% with BMS more than doubling, reflecting our leadership position in the electrification ecosystem. For the year, auto exhibited robust broad-based growth, finishing up 36%. Consumer represented 12% of revenue and increased more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of annual growth. Over a year ago, we said Consumer would grow in 2021 and the team delivered on this commitment, with consumer increasing 12% for the year. 
Moving on to the rest of the fourth quarter P&L. I'm going to speak to the results inclusive of the partial quarter of Maxim. Gross margins were 70.9%, up 90 bps year-over-year. Operating margins finished at 43.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Nonop expense was $44 million and the tax rate was 12.7%.  
All in, adjusted EPS was $1.73 above the midpoint of guide and up more than 20% year-over-year. If we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and equivalents and on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 turns. Building on our ESG efforts, we continue to strategically leverage sustainable financing. We're proud to be the first U.S. tech company to deploy 3 sustainable finance instruments with our inaugural green bond issuance, a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility and a sustainability linked to bond offering.  
Specifically, this bond offering was part of our $4 billion refinancing efforts during the quarter. And as a result, we lowered our weighted average coupon to 2.7% while extending the average duration of our total debt by nearly 10 years.  
Inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially after adjusting for the partial quarter of Maxim activity and the fair value step-up of inventory related to the acquisition, while inventory days were down slightly. Channel inventory declined and remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target.  
Moving to the cash flow statement. For the year, cash flow from operations increased 36% to more than $2.7 billion. We generated a record free cash flow of $2.4 billion or approximately 33% of revenue despite CapEx more than doubling to $344 million or 4.7% of revenue. We also returned a record $3.7 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow to shareholders this year by dividends and buybacks, including 80% of our $2.5 billion ASR program.  
As a reminder, we plan to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. This is accomplished by growing our dividend annually with a 40% to 60% dividend payout target and by using residual cash flow for buybacks. We entered 2022 as a much larger enterprise with an attractive long-term outlook. As Vince mentioned, we plan to increase our capacity investments to support revenue growth and reinforce the resiliency and efficiency of our hybrid manufacturing model.  
As such, we anticipate CapEx being 6% to 8% of revenue for 2022 above our long-term model of 4%. This step-up in CapEx will not impact the commitment we made in September to buy back 5 billion of shares by the end of calendar '22.  
So now on to the first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Based on the midpoint, we expect operating margin to be 43.3%, plus or minus 70 bps. We expect nonop expenses of approximately $50 million, a 12.5% tax rate and a share count of approximately 530 million. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.78 plus or minus $0.10. 
For additional context, using the fourth quarter pro forma combined revenue as a base, our guide at the midpoint implies low single-digit growth quarter-on-quarter in Q1 for what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter. This growth is driven by an increase in B2B quarter-over-quarter, while Consumer is down sequentially.  
So before closing, I want to give a brief update on our Maxim integration progress. Phase 1 of shareholder value creation is well underway, building conviction in our cost synergy timeline. We anticipate realizing over 40% of the initial $275 million OpEx and COGS synergy target in fiscal '22 with the remaining coming in fiscal '23.  
I'm proud of the team's effort and confident this pace of execution will continue. At our Analyst Day next spring, we'll update investors on our progress as well as provide more details on Phases 2 and 3, which relate to additional savings from infrastructure optimization and revenue synergies, respectively.  
Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to congratulate Michael Lucarelli on his promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Look forward to working with you, Mike, in this continued partnership. Let me hand it over to you to take Q&A."

In the past quarter, our organic supply had some impact from some COVID shutdowns in Southeast Asia that affected much of the industry. We still did grow sequentially in the fourth quarter.

Why don't I take pricing, and I'll let Vince kind of speak how we think about it longer term. So in the -- the short answer is, for 2021, we've been talking about rising cost inflation over the course of the year, and we've been raising our prices with the goal of neutralizing the impact to margin. I would say that in the fiscal year that just finished, cost increases and price increases were not completely synchronized. 
So it's very likely that cost inflation outpaced our pricing actions for the year, and we're likely a modest headwind to the year. As we go into 2022, we're looking for the inverse of that. We're looking for pricing net of inflation to be a modest tailwind to the year as the price increases that have begun begin to get more traction. And we believe that while we still will have some cost increases over the course of the year, most of those are now baked into the run rate."

And we also maintain products for our customers that are often more than 20 years in -- 20 years old in vintage terms. 
We've taken a very measured approach to pricing over the last year. And we've been very transparent with our customers as well that price increases are really more about passing on costs rather than looking to enhancing our margins. 
Last comment on pricing. I think the industry, as we approach this kind of post-Moore's Law era, we're in an era now, I believe, of structural price increases rather than cyclical. 
In other words, I think you'll start to see inflation sustained for the industry in the years ahead. It's been proven over the last couple of years for certain that semis are the roots of the modern digital economy. And I think customers understand as well that importance and the value that is increasingly created by semi. So I believe that, as I said, inflation will persist. It will moderate, but I think it's a facet now of the business structure of the semi industry and indeed ADI's business."

Yes, I think -- I mean, there are many, many -- I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for example, that Maxim is very underrepresented in the industrial space, where ADI is very, very strong. Half our business -- total business is industrial, and it's a very, very small part of Maxim's business. 
And where I see the opportunity there is really on the power side of things, power management, in particular. It's the fastest-growing segment in the analog space. And I think generally, across the board, we're still underrepresented as a company in power. We will -- we today have approximately $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion of combined power revenues. 
My sense is we can double that in a reasonable period of time. And we'll give a lot more detail on that when we get to the Investor Day over the next couple of months. And from an application and market standpoint, I'd just like to point to data center. You know the power management solutions that Maxim has for companionship with cloud processors, AI machines, accelerators and so on. I think we'll combine very nicely with ADI's data center micromodules. 
And then in Automotive, connectivity, Maxim's GMSL high-speed link technology used in our in-cabin connectivity portfolio will enable us to optimize solutions and address a lot more applications in the car. And that's a nice companion as well to ADI's A2B connectivity solution for audio. 
And last but not least, Maxim has added a lot of heft to our BMS portfolio. And our portfolio now is double the size it was pre-Maxim. So -- and as I mentioned in -- again, in the prepared remarks, we now sell 7 out of the top 10 OEMs in the electric car area. So -- and there's a lot more examples, but they are the primary ones I'd like to point out at this stage."

We're seeing broad-based demand continue. I think also, we're seeing some improvement, generally speaking. With each passing month, we're seeing improvements in supply. So I think that line of sight gives us increased confidence. That's both internally as well as externally. 
We are in catch up more than pricing. So I think you'll see some significant contribution in 2022 from pricing activities. And also, inventories continue to remain low in the distribution channel and, of course, on the customer side pretty much on a broad basis. So I think overall, '22 should shape up to be a good year.

On the Maxim side, we've done the same, but that -- those orders only went in when the deal closed. So given the long lead times from the semi-cap guys, we're probably unlikely to see a meaningful increase in Maxim's ability to supply until the tail end of the year. So unfortunately, I think Maxim from a fiscal year basis will probably be a little bit of a drag on growth just because we can't get the tools fast enough."

On gross margins, the -- so first quarter seasonally tends to be a little bit lower because we have the holiday shutdowns and this first quarter here will have a full quarter of Maxim, which, as many of you know, had lower gross margins than stand-alone ADI. So we've got some headwind coming from that. 
The tailwind is we've got the revenue that's coming in strong and pricing, as I mentioned earlier, is going to be -- start to be mildly accretive. So all in, I would think gross margins kind of sequentially I think flattish is a safe model."

On testing inventories, I think you mentioned that they continue to be below your target range of 7 to 8 weeks. And I know that on a finished goods perspective, at least through Q3, that was down year-over-year, it was down year-to-date versus an increase in total inventories, which implies to me that consignment or direct customer inventories are also quite lean and demand is strong. And so I guess what's your view on when the team and your customers will be in a position to build back inventories? Or is it just hand them out for the next several quarters?"

Our inventory numbers are a little bit confusing because of some of the math that's in there. So I'll just go back to what I said in the prepared remarks. Days of inventory was down slightly. The internal inventory balance was up as we built raw materials and WIP. 
You have some noise in there from Maxim's inventory being added ours in middle of the quarter as well as the purchase accounting math, which requires us to do a step up of that. So adjusting for all of that, we were up slightly in terms of ADI balance sheet inventory, and most of that was in WIP. 
On the channel side, it remains very lean and well below where we want it to be, and that causes some challenges on customer service as it does for everyone in the industry. We don't see that abating at least for the first or second quarter, and we -- it's hard for us to see further out than that."

On the Maxim side, I mentioned that is pretty much flat for most of the year. We're optimistic that we might be able to see some improvement towards the tail end of the year as we get more equipment in. 
On the external side, I will say that Vince himself is personally involved in conversations with our foundry partners and looking to get additional wafer capacity when we can. But it's very much driven by what nodes are available. And maybe I'll pass to Vince here to add a bit more comments since he's been having a lot of those conversations."
