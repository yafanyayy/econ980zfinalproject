Before we go through our fourth quarter and 2020 financial results, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on the past year.

Before we go through our fourth quarter and 2020 financial results, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on the past year. As we all know, 2020 was a year that brought many unforeseen challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our contributions in testing, treatment and vaccination have helped with the global effort to combat COVID-19, there is still much more progress to be made to overcome the pandemic.
It's also not lost on us that part of our financial performance in 2020 was driven by the work we're doing to tackle a health crisis which has had such a devastating impact on so many around the world. That being said, we're also very proud of our contributions to fight the pandemic, and we'll continue to work tirelessly to support these global efforts in 2021 and beyond as necessary.
So as I look back on 2020, I'm most struck by our associates' teamwork, dedication and invaluable contributions during these difficult times. They are truly making a difference in the world. And since the onset of the pandemic, our team has met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to help our customers, patients and the global community. Their efforts have been both humbling and inspiring.
I'd also like to recognize and thank our customers, suppliers and business partners, many of whom we called upon for additional support to continue meeting demand throughout this pandemic. We're incredibly grateful and won't forget their collective efforts over the past year.
1 of our 5 core values at Danaher is the best team wins, and I believe we truly saw that in action in 2020.
So with that, let's turn to our 2020 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue growth, 170 basis points of core operating margin expansion, 43% earnings per share growth and over $5 billion of free cash flow. We also closed the largest acquisition in our history, welcoming the Cytiva team to Danaher in March of last year. Cytiva is a global leader in bioprocessing and has played a major role in supporting the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. In 2020, the business generated more than 25% core revenue growth and over $4 billion of revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with Cytiva's early results, all driven by a highly talented, engaged and innovative team that has embraced the Danaher business system.
So now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results. We generated $6.8 billion of sales with 15.5% core revenue growth and believe we continued to capture market share across many of our businesses through accelerated investment in new product innovation, enhanced commercial execution and by deploying new engagement techniques, new customer engagement techniques during the pandemic.
COVID-related revenue tailwind contributed approximately 1,200 basis points to core revenue growth while our underlying base business was up approximately 3.5%. Geographically, we saw broad-based and consistent revenue growth during the quarter. Developed markets were up mid-teens, with similar growth in both the U.S. and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up low double digits, driven by another excellent quarter in China.
Our gross profit margin was 58.5%, and our operating profit margin of 23.7% was up 390 basis points, including 360 basis points of core margin expansion. Our outstanding margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core revenue growth and the impact of the Danaher business system on productivity and operations across all of our platforms.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.08 was up 63% versus last year. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion for the full year, up 134% and 79%, respectively. Our free cash flow to net income conversion was 149% for the full year and marks the 29th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. The combination of our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet gives us more degrees of freedom earlier than anticipated after the Cytiva closing and positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities.
Given our strong margin and cash flow performance, we took the opportunity to accelerate investments in high-impact growth initiatives across Danaher, including innovation and collaboration projects. We're also expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand for COVID-related testing and treatment while positioning the businesses for continued long-term growth.
So now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increase as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, with core revenue up 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 30% or more at Cytiva, Pall Biotech, Beckman Life Sciences and IDT. We continue to see strong demand from our biopharma customers during the quarter, and our non-COVID-related biopharma business was up double digits. And we also saw an acceleration in activity focused on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. We also saw customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities to support the development and production of COVID-related tests and treatment.
In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, order trends and installations improved as academic and research labs continued to reopen.  SCIEX benefited from this uptick in activity and delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by demand for new products such as the 7500 Triple Quad and the Echo MS.
Moving over to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 23.5%, with core revenue up 21.5%, led by more than 100% core growth at Cepheid, driven by elevated COVID-19 testing demand and GeneXpert systems placements. Cepheid achieved a significant milestone in December, surpassing $2 billion in annual revenue, just 1 year after hitting the $1 billion mark. It's a tremendous accomplishment by a fantastic team.
Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, both delivered high single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks steadily resumed through the quarter.
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 2% and core revenue was up 1%. Our water quality platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth, and product identification was down slightly. Across our water quality businesses, we saw solid demand for our consumables and chemistries as we continue to support customers' day-to-day mission-critical water operations. Equipment declines moderated as more customer facilities got back up and running. And by end market, municipal activity and project continued to resume and industrial declines moderated.
ChemTreat delivered its 52nd consecutive year of core revenue growth in 2020, an impressive accomplishment in any year, but even more so given the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Across our water quality platform, the team's focused execution, combined with our innovative offering and the positioning of our portfolio, enabled the water quality platform to achieve positive core revenue growth for the full year.
At our product identification platform, positive results in our marking and coding businesses were offset by moderating declines in packaging and color management. Consumables and services held up well globally as we continue to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic.
So with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let me give you some color on the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies.
Customer activity around the world remains broadly consistent with what we saw back in October and through the fourth quarter, and we expect this relative stability to persist near term. Despite rising COVID infection rates and new targeted lockdowns in certain regions, customers are adapting to working in this new pandemic environment, and we have not yet seen a material impact on demand.
Within Life Sciences, COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity continues to drive record bioprocessing demand. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bioprocessing exposure, and their combined order growth in the quarter was up more than 50%. As a market leader across the bioprocessing workflow, our teams are playing a significant role in the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatment while working to ramp up manufacturing capabilities on a massive and very compressed time line.
We are involved in the majority of more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway globally, including all of the vaccines in the U.S. that have recently received FDA Emergency Use Authorization or are in late-stage clinical trials. We're very proud of our team's tireless efforts, which will directly impact the lives of so many people around the world.
From where we stand today, we estimate that 2021 revenue opportunity associated with COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics at Cytiva and Pall Biotech will be approximately $1.3 billion, roughly twice the amount we recognized in 2020. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remained strong and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. 
Turning to our other life science end market. And as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs are continuing to reopen, albeit at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people in the lab at any one time. In clinical diagnostics, heightened demand continues for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care setting. Since launching the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped approximately 9 million test cartridges in the fourth quarter. As anticipated, approximately 60% of the respiratory tests shipped in the fourth quarter were COVID-only tests and 40% were 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B and RSV. The team also placed a record number of new systems in 2020, increasing Cepheid's installed base by more than 35% year-over-year to over 30,000 instruments globally and reinforcing its market-leading position in molecular diagnostics. Cepheid's differentiated offering and leading presence at the point of care position the business to help meet customers' testing needs in 2021 and beyond. As a result of this strong positioning and the elevated COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates we are still seeing today, we expect to ship at least 9 million tests per quarter for the duration of 2021. 
Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes remain steady as elective procedures and wellness checks continue at a similar pace as we saw through Q4. We're closely monitoring patient activity in areas that have recently implemented new lockdowns, but we've not seen any material impact at this point.
During the quarter, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics expanded its COVID-related test menu with the addition of a high-volume antigen test. This automated test is designed to run on Beckman's immunoassay analyzers and can help address the challenges associated with scaling up antigen testing to make higher-volume mass testing possible. Beckman's automated antigen test is another important addition to our COVID diagnostics offering and a testament to the Beckman team's strong cadence of innovation, having launched 6 new COVID-related tests in as many months.
Finally, in the applied markets, consumables remain solid as customers sustain essentials business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And we're encouraged to see sequential improvement on the equipment side as customers initiate new projects and capital investments.
Looking ahead now to the first quarter and full year 2021. We expect to deliver mid- to high teens core revenue growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 1,300 basis points to core revenue growth with mid-single-digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID-related businesses. For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth, with growth moderating sequentially in the second half of the year as a result of tougher prior year comparison. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 500 basis points to core revenue growth for the full year with mid- to high single-digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID-related businesses.
So to wrap up, 2020 was an exceptional year for Danaher. Our team took the challenges presented by the pandemic and turned them into opportunities to support customers across all of our businesses and also directly contribute to the fight against COVID-19. We're all humbled by our associates' efforts and believe that Danaher's future is bright, thanks to their dedication.
2020 was also a transformative year for Danaher with the addition of Cytiva. This was one of several strategic portfolio moves we have made over the last few years to build a better, stronger company and establish Danaher as a global science and technology leader. Looking ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, excellent portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, position Danaher to outperform in 2021 and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

And that's really based on the approved vaccines that we see out there in the marketplace as well as the volumes that we see related to clinical trials as it relates to other vaccines. So we think that we have good sustainability and strong backlog here to be able to make sure that we cover that $1.3 billion.
Additionally, coming back to your capacity point, we have been expanding capacity continuously, even prior to the close of the transaction. We had agreed with GE to continue capacity expansion. We have then, after the close, continued to invest, whether that's at Cytiva, Pall Biotech or elsewhere, in order to make sure that we're able to meet our customers' demand. And that will continue to occur here through the year 2021 and beyond."

I mean, Tycho, I think maybe the way to think about it is that it helps to kind of sustain a similar margin profile than what we've seen before. So maybe if you think about kind of from a fall-through perspective on the core growth here for 2021 and, frankly, for Q1 as well we're sort of assuming we're going to see about a 40% or so fall-through for, like I said, for both Q1 and 2021. 
Now that's down slightly from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters, but I think we want to kind of stay aggressive in what we've been doing on the growth investment side, one; and two, we are starting to see a little bit of inflationary pressure, particularly around kind of freight and a little bit in the supply chain as well. And then China also is -- we've got some targeted lockdowns, as you know, now. But in the fourth quarter, we really saw China sort of having intercountry, if you will, travel be pretty significant. They're moving around quite a bit and getting back at it. So I think we're sort of thinking instead of maybe the levels of fall-through we've seen, it might be more like 40%. But again, I think we'll be able to hopefully sustain something like that given what you talked about, which is a pretty good margin profile of both of those businesses that will continue to be pretty strong here next year."

And the answer has to be fast, and it has to be right. And the Cepheid GeneXpert is just the perfect solution for that.
At the same time, we've been thinking about those placements for the long term. You may be aware that Cepheid has the largest molecular diagnostic menu in the U.S. with over 20 tests and outside of the U.S. with over 30 tests. And so we've placed those instruments primarily there where we see that, even in a post-COVID world, they would find great utilization based on the full testing menu."

I'm curious what's driving that acceleration in base Life Sciences in the back half of '20 and why is the guide assuming mid-singles for '21."

They've been able to work out their social distancing protocols. They're not up to full capacity yet, but they certainly have been improving, and that's given us more lab access to continue installations and, of course, brings the service business back online. So that's been continuously improving. And we would expect that trend to continue here in 2021.
Now as we think about the guide here, mid- to high teens, look, we have our base business there at mid-single digits, which is 100, 150 basis points acceleration, as well as the COVID tailwind accelerating here to 1,300 basis points. So we think we're well placed there. And just as a reminder, we've got a couple of working days less also in the first quarter of 2021. And  then lastly, as it relates to the COVID tailwinds, keep in mind that Cepheid already last year in the first quarter had a very strong quarter as the physicians were trying to rule out flu, if you will, with more flu testing in the absence of an actual COVID test."

One, we expect that pipeline to be very relevant to the capacity that's being created today. In fact, many of our investments are merely pulling forward things that we had planned for several years down the road. That's kind of one point.
But the second point is that it also looks as though vaccine manufacturing will be with us for some time, not only as it relates to COVID, but as you think about the bolus of investment that has now gone into biotech companies that are looking at new vaccine technologies to get at diseases where we've yet to develop vaccines, we do see increasing number of projects there as well.

Now as we look forward to 2021, starting with Q1, we expect our businesses to be over 50% in China in terms of the growth in Q1. So really getting out of the gates there very strongly. Of course, they had a lower comparison there in Q1 of 2020. And as we think about the full year, we really see China in the mid-teens. So very solid performance, very strong recovery after a full year which really came in at the low single digits.

So looking to point of care here and COVID testing in general for the second half, it's very hard to forecast right now how COVID testing will play out in the second half just because, as we think about vaccines rolling out, we're already now talking about a variant. Who knows how many more of those will occur? And of course, often the dialogue tends to be about what's happening in the U.S. But in fact, other places around the world are not vaccinating yet at that rate or even don't have vaccines yet. So we think that, that planning assumption of 9 million per quarter is a very solid planning assumption.
And then as it relates to Cepheid, in particular, at the point of care, you may have heard this concentric circle metaphor. But point of care is really at the center of that in terms of the durability of that testing for the long term because that's where the doctors need fast turnaround time, that's where they need an accurate result because they're going to make a therapeutic decision. They're going to make a decision as to what happens next. And the outer portions of those concentric circles are the ones that have increasingly less durability as the general public becomes vaccinated. And over time, although it's going to be interesting to see whether that's achieved in the second half of the year, whether the herd immunity is even relevant.
Keep in mind, herd immunity is not something that happens in a country. The whole world is a petri dish here. And if we continue to travel and interact with each other, there is a high likelihood that high testing volumes will continue for some time."

Before we go through our fourth quarter and 2020 financial results, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on the past year.

Before we go through our fourth quarter and 2020 financial results, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on the past year. As we all know, 2020 was a year that brought many unforeseen challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our contributions in testing, treatment and vaccination have helped with the global effort to combat COVID-19, there is still much more progress to be made to overcome the pandemic. 
It's also not lost on us that part of our financial performance in 2020 was driven by the work we're doing to tackle a health crisis which has had such a devastating impact on so many around the world. That being said, we're also very proud of our contributions to fight the pandemic, and we'll continue to work tirelessly to support these global efforts in 2021 and beyond as necessary. 
So as I look back on 2020, I'm most struck by our associates' teamwork, dedication and invaluable contributions during these difficult times. They are truly making a difference in the world. And since the onset of the pandemic, our team has met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to help our customers, patients and the global community. Their efforts have been both humbling and inspiring. 
I'd also like to recognize and thank our customers, suppliers and business partners, many of whom we called upon for additional support to continue meeting demand throughout this pandemic. We're incredibly grateful and won't forget their collective efforts over the past year. 1 of our 5 core values at Danaher is the best team wins, and I believe we truly saw that in action in 2020. 
So with that, let's turn to our 2020 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue growth, 170 basis points of core operating margin expansion, 43% earnings per share growth and over $5 billion of free cash flow. We also closed the largest acquisition in our history, welcoming the Cytiva team to Danaher in March of last year. Cytiva is a global leader in bioprocessing and has played a major role in supporting the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. In 2020, the business generated more than 25% core revenue growth and over $4 billion of revenue. We couldn't be more pleased with Cytiva's early results, all driven by a highly talented, engaged and innovative team that has embraced the Danaher Business System. 
So now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results. We generated $6.8 billion of sales with 15.5% core revenue growth and believe we continued to capture market share across many of our businesses through accelerated investment in new product innovation, enhanced commercial execution and by deploying new engagement techniques -- new customer engagement techniques during the pandemic. 
COVID-related revenue tailwind contributed approximately 1,200 basis points to core revenue growth, while our underlying base business was up approximately 3.5%. Geographically, we saw broad-based and consistent revenue growth during the quarter. Developed markets were up mid-teens with similar growth in both the U.S. and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up low double digits, driven by another excellent quarter in China. 
Our gross profit margin was 58.5%, and our operating profit margin of 23.7% was up 390 basis points, including 360 basis points of core margin expansion. Our outstanding margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core revenue growth and the impact of the Danaher Business System on productivity and operations across all of our platforms. 
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.08 was up 63% versus last year. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion for the full year, up 134% and 79%, respectively. Our free cash flow to net income conversion was 149% for the full year and marks the 29th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher. The combination of our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet gives us more degrees of freedom earlier than anticipated after the Cytiva closing and positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. 
Given our strong margin and cash flow performance, we took the opportunity to accelerate investments in high-impact growth initiatives across Danaher, including innovation and collaboration projects. We're also expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand for COVID-related testing and treatment while positioning the businesses for continued long-term growth. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increase as a result of the Cytiva acquisition with core revenue up 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 30% or more at Cytiva, Pall Biotech, Beckman Life Sciences and IDT. We continue to see strong demand from our biopharma customers during the quarter, and our non-COVID-related biopharma business was up double digits. And we also saw an acceleration in activity focused on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. We also saw customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities to support the development and production of COVID-related tests and treatment. 
In our more instrument-oriented Life Science businesses, order trends and installations improved as academic and research labs continued to reopen. SCIEX benefited from this uptick in activity and delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by demand for new products such as the 7500 Triple Quad and the Echo MS. 
Moving over to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 23.5% with core revenue up 21.5%, led by more than 100% core growth at Cepheid, driven by elevated COVID-19 testing demand and GeneXpert systems placements. Cepheid achieved a significant milestone in December, surpassing $2 billion in annual revenue, just 1 year after hitting the $1 billion mark. It's a tremendous accomplishment by a fantastic team. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, both delivered high single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks steadily resumed through the quarter. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue was up 2%, and core revenue was up 1%. Our water quality platform delivered low single-digit core revenue growth, and product identification was down slightly. Across our water quality businesses, we saw solid demand for our consumables and chemistries as we continue to support customers' day-to-day, mission-critical water operations. Equipment declines moderated as more customer facilities got back up and running. And by end market, municipal activity and projects continued to resume and industrial declines moderated. 
ChemTreat delivered its 52nd consecutive year of core revenue growth in 2020, an impressive accomplishment in any year, but even more so given the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Across our water quality platform, the team's focused execution, combined with our innovative offering and the positioning of our portfolio, enabled the water quality platform to achieve positive core revenue growth for the full year.
At our product identification platform, positive results in our marking and coding businesses were offset by moderating declines in packaging and color management. Consumables and services held up well globally as we continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic. 
So with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let me give you some color on the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies. Customer activity around the world remains broadly consistent with what we saw back in October and through the fourth quarter, and we expect this relative stability to persist near term. Despite rising COVID infection rates and new targeted lockdowns in certain regions, customers are adapting to working in this new pandemic environment, and we have not yet seen a material impact on demand. 
Within Life Sciences, COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity continues to drive record bioprocessing demand. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bioprocessing exposure, and their combined order growth in the quarter was up more than 50%. As a market leader across the bioprocessing workflow, our teams are playing a significant role in the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatment while working to ramp up manufacturing capabilities on a massive and very compressed time line. 
We are involved in the majority of more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway globally, including all of the vaccines in the U.S. that have recently received FDA Emergency Use Authorization or are in late-stage clinical trials. We're very proud of our team's tireless efforts, which will directly impact the lives of so many people around the world. 
From where we stand today, we estimate that 2021 revenue opportunity associated with COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics at Cytiva and Pall Biotech will be approximately $1.3 billion, roughly twice the amount we recognized in 2020. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remained strong and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters.  
Turning to our other Life Science end markets. And as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs are continuing to reopen, albeit at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people in the lab at any one time. In clinical diagnostics, heightened demand continues for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care settings. Since launching the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped approximately 9 million test cartridges in the fourth quarter. As anticipated, approximately 60% of the respiratory tests shipped in the fourth quarter were COVID-only tests and 40% were 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV.
The team also placed a record number of new systems in 2020, increasing Cepheid's installed base by more than 35% year-over-year to over 30,000 instruments globally and reinforcing its market-leading position in molecular diagnostics. Cepheid's differentiated offering and leading presence at the point of care position the business to help meet customers' testing needs in 2021 and beyond. As a result of this strong positioning and the elevated COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates we are still seeing today, we expect to ship at least 9 million tests per quarter for the duration of 2021.  
Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes remain steady as elective procedures and wellness checks continue at a similar pace as we saw through Q4. We're closely monitoring patient activity in areas that have recently implemented new lockdowns, but we've not seen any material impact at this point. 
During the quarter, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics expanded its COVID-related test menu with the addition of a high-volume antigen test. This automated test is designed to run on Beckman's immunoassay analyzers and can help address the challenges associated with scaling up antigen testing to make higher-volume mass testing possible. Beckman's automated antigen test is another important addition to our COVID diagnostics offering and a testament to the Beckman team's strong cadence of innovation, having launched 6 new COVID-related tests in as many months. 
Finally, in the applied markets, consumables remain solid as customers sustain essential businesses -- business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And we're encouraged to see sequential improvement on the equipment side as customers initiate new projects and capital investments. 
Looking ahead now to the first quarter and full year 2021. We expect to deliver mid- to high-teens core revenue growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 1,300 basis points to core revenue growth with mid-single-digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID-related businesses. For the full year 2021, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth, with growth moderating sequentially in the second half of the year as a result of tougher prior year comparisons. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will contribute approximately 500 basis points to core revenue growth for the full year with mid to high single-digit core revenue growth in our non-COVID-related businesses. 
So to wrap up, 2020 was an exceptional year for Danaher. Our team took the challenges presented by the pandemic and turned them into opportunities to support customers across all of our businesses and also directly contribute to the fight against COVID-19. We're all humbled by our associates' efforts and believe that Danaher's future is bright, thanks to their dedication. 
2020 was also a transformative year for Danaher with the addition of Cytiva. This was one of several strategic portfolio moves we have made over the last few years to build a better, stronger company and establish Danaher as a global science and technology leader. Looking ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, excellent portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, position Danaher to outperform in 2021 and beyond. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

So maybe if you think about kind of from a fall-through perspective on the core growth here for 2021 and, frankly, for Q1 as well, we're sort of assuming we're going to see about a 40%-or-so fall-through for, like I said, for both Q1 and 2021.
Now that's down slightly from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters, but I think we want to kind of stay aggressive in what we've been doing on the growth investment side, one. And two, we are starting to see a little bit of inflationary pressure, particularly around kind of freight and a little bit in the supply chain as well.
And then China also is -- we've got some targeted lockdowns, as you know, now. But in the fourth quarter, we really saw China sort of having intercountry, if you will, travel be pretty significant. They're moving around quite a bit and getting back at it. So I think we're sort of thinking instead of maybe the levels of fall-through we've seen, it might be more like 40%. But again, I think we'll be able to hopefully sustain something like that given what you talked about, which is a pretty good margin profile of both those businesses that will continue to be pretty strong here next year."

At the same time, we've been thinking about those placements for the long term.

So I mean I really think we've got good sustainability as we head into '21, given the backlog, given what we saw in order growth in Cytiva in Q4 and given the base business sort of going low double digits."

We've always looked at this as an opportunity to strengthen our capabilities and exit the pandemic stronger than we entered, whether that's in businesses that have -- that are benefiting from COVID tailwinds or businesses that are not in that particular application.
And so what we do is we work together with our teams to identify where the most attractive projects are, not just on a return perspective here in the near term, but also strategically positioning us for competitive advantage, and then we will invest aggressively in those. And that's been the case here for several quarters now. So we'll continue to do that."

But that also has some assumptions behind it, which is here we are supplying the approved vaccines as well as those that are in clinical trials. And you know we're well positioned not just on the vaccine in project Warp Speed, but the over 400 projects that you have, both vaccines and therapeutics.

So looking to point of care here and COVID testing in general for the second half, it's very hard to forecast right now how COVID testing will play out in the second half just because as we think about vaccines rolling out, we're already now talking about a variant. Who knows how many more of those will occur? And of course, often, the dialogue tends to be about what's happening in the U.S. But in fact, other places around the world are not vaccinating yet at that rate or even don't have vaccines yet. So we think that, that planning assumption of 9 million per quarter is a very solid planning assumption.
And then as it relates to Cepheid, in particular, at the point of care, you may have heard this concentric circle metaphor, but point of care is really at the center of that in terms of the durability of that testing for the long term because that's where the doctors need fast turnaround time. That's where they need an accurate result because they're going to make a therapeutic decision. They're going to make a decision as to what happens next. And the outer portions of those concentric circles are the ones that have increasingly less durability as the general public becomes vaccinated. And over time, although it's going to be interesting to see whether that's achieved in the second half of the year, whether herd immunity is even relevant. Keep in mind, herd immunity is not something that happens in a country. The whole world is a petri dish here. And if we continue to travel and interact with each other, there is a high likelihood that high testing volumes will continue for some time."

In the first quarter of 2021, we got off to a very strong start, delivering better-than-expected core revenue growth across our portfolio. Our broad-based performance was driven by double-digit core revenue",1836,"Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of 2021, we got off to a very strong start, delivering better-than-expected core revenue growth across our portfolio. Our broad-based performance was driven by double-digit core revenue growth in our base business, our ongoing contributions to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and strong demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular diagnostic tests. Our record top line performance also contributed to outstanding earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. Our well-rounded first quarter results are a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our commitment to continuous improvement. 
We have an exceptional collection of market-leading franchises and technologies all powered by the Danaher Business System, that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. 
So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. We generated $6.9 billion of sales in the first quarter with 30% core revenue growth. All 3 of our reporting segments delivered better-than-expected growth, led by Life Sciences and Diagnostics. We believe we continue to capture market share, particularly at some of our larger businesses, including Cytiva, Pall, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, Hach and Videojet. 
Over the last several years, we've prioritized high-impact growth investments in innovation, sales and marketing, to ensure that we're well positioned both near and long term. Through new product introductions and the impact of our Danaher Business System growth tools, we've enhanced our competitive advantage and believe we've achieved notable market share gain. 
Geographically, revenue growth was broad-based across both developed and high-growth markets.  We saw over 20% growth in the developed market, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up more than 45%, largely driven by the recovery in China. Our gross profit margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 62% in the first quarter, largely due to higher sales volumes and the positive impact of higher-margin product mix. Our operating profit margin of 29.1% was up 1,300 basis points year-over-year, including more than 900 basis points of core margin expansion as a result of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses as we continue to see limited travel and other related costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.52 were up 140% versus last year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 135% year-over-year. 
Now in the first quarter, we deployed more than $400 million of capital towards mergers and acquisitions across all 3 segments. Most notably, IDT and Cytiva completed their first bolt-on acquisition with IDT adding Swift Biosciences, which brings complementary capabilities and a broad portfolio of next-gen sequencing library preparation and enrichment solutions for DNA, RNA and methylated DNA samples. And Cytiva acquired Vanrx Pharmasystems, which provides innovative, automated aseptic tolling technologies used to fill vials, syringes and cartridges, a critical final step to complete the bioprocessing workflow. We also continued to make significant organic investments and high-impact growth initiatives across all of Danaher. 
Over the past 6 months, we've invested in a meaningful expansion of production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva, Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences. Near term, these investments will support COVID-related demand, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses, where we see tremendous runway ahead given the underlying growth drivers and the durability of the markets they serve. Between these 4 businesses, we're investing more than $1 billion in 2021 to continue to meet our customers' needs today and well into the future. 
So now let's take a look -- a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 115% as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, and core revenue was up 41.5%. We saw strong double-digit core revenue growth across all of our largest operating companies in the platform, led by Cytiva, Pall Life Sciences, Beckman Life Sciences and IDT. 
In our bioprocessing businesses, accelerating demand for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutic development and production drove a combined core revenue growth rate of more than 60% at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Excluding the impact of COVID-related activity, our underlying biopharma business grew in the low 20s range. We believe that our ability to continue meeting customers' needs across their bioprocessing workflows enabled us to gain market share in the quarter, particularly within our cell culture media and single-use product line. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 34%, and core revenue grew 31%. Each of our largest operating companies in the platform achieved high single digit or better core revenue growth, led by Cepheid, which achieved more than 90% core revenue growth. In response to the unprecedented demand for Cepheid's rapid point-of-care molecular test, the team again increased production capacity and shipped over 10 million respiratory test cartridges in the first quarter. Roughly half of the tests shipped were COVID-only tests, and the other half were 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19 Flu A, Flu B and RSV. We also saw increasing demand for nonrespiratory tests across Cepheid's market-leading test menu, including sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and urology, demonstrating the broad applicability of Cepheid's molecular diagnostic offering. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 3.5%. Our Water Quality platform was up slightly and product identification was up high single digits. Our Water Quality businesses support customers' day-to-day mission-critical water operations, providing water testing, treatment and analysis across a variety of applications around the world. We saw good underlying demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables during the quarter, and we're encouraged by the improvement in equipment sales, which returned to growth as customers got back up and running at more normalized levels. 
In Product Identification, we saw mid single-digit core revenue growth in our marking and coding businesses and double-digit growth in packaging and color management. Esko and X-Rite benefited from the underlying market recovery and saw good momentum from customers initiating new projects and investments in the first quarter. 
So with that context from what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look -- walk through some of the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies. Customer activity around the world is approaching pre-pandemic levels as we all collectively adapt to working in this new environment. We're seeing this in the form of strong sales funnels and order book growth. Service levels at or near pre-pandemic levels and an uptick in equipment revenues. While some of this dynamic is a result of pent-up demand in the wake of widespread lockdowns, we're starting to see underlying recovery across most of our end markets that were impacted. 
Now if we take a closer look at these dynamics by geography, China appears to be the furthest along in terms of reopening, with activity levels largely back to normal. The U.S. is not all the way back just yet, but is moving in the right direction. And an increase in vaccination rates across the country appear to be driving some of this progress. Europe is improving broadly. And while certain areas have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, we've not seen any material impact. 
In Life Sciences, activity in the broader biopharma market remains robust. There has not been any slowdown in the double-digit growth trend we've seen over the last several quarters across non-COVID-related biopharma activity. Within COVID-related biopharma activity, the significant ramp-up of vaccines and therapeutics is driving record bioprocessing demand. We're involved in the majority of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway around the world today, including all of those in the U.S. that are currently on the market or in later-stage clinical trials. Our operating companies are playing a significant role in the development and production of new therapies and vaccines across the biopharma pipeline. And given the breadth of our offering and the production capacity we're adding in 2021, we're uniquely positioned to support our customers in their mission today and well into the future, which is to make more life-saving treatment available to more patients faster. 
In clinical diagnostics, we continue to see heightened demand for rapid point-of-care molecular testing. As we look across the COVID-19 testing landscape and consider the durability of the demand that we're seeing, we believe that Cepheid's positioning is the strongest amongst the various testing modalities and settings. Cepheid's leading presence at the point of care, combined with the speed, accuracy and workflow advantages of their molecular offering, uniquely positions the business to support customers' testing needs, not only for COVID-19, but beyond the pandemic as well. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major geographies as elective procedures and hospital visits have rebounded from last year. Consumables growth is accelerating as a result, and we're encouraged by the momentum of instrument placement. 
Finally, in the applied market, consumables remain solid across essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And growth is picking up on the equipment side as customers get back to more normal operations and initiate capital investments. 
Now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver second quarter core revenue growth in the mid-20s range. We anticipate low double-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a low double-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to have operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2021. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver high teens core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will be a high single-digit to low double-digit contribution to the core revenue growth rate. This would include an estimated $2 billion of 2021 revenue at Cytiva and Pall Biotech associated with vaccines and therapeutics, which is higher than our previous expectation of $1.3 billion. And at Cepheid, we'll continue ramping capacity through the year and now expect to ship approximately 45 million tests in 2021 compared to our prior estimate of 36 million tests. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up high single digits for the full year. 
So to wrap up, we had a very strong start to the year and feel good about the momentum we're seeing across all of Danaher. Our first quarter results are a testament to the commitment and capability of our team and a durable, balanced positioning of our portfolio. We believe this combination differentiates Danaher and sets us up well to outperform in 2021 and beyond. In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we'll strive to keep building an even better, stronger company and to positively impact the world around us in meaningful ways for all of our stakeholders. We see tremendous opportunities ahead to do just that. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

And like Rainer said, that really sort of doesn't kind of -- that's just where we stand today with the assumption, as Rainer mentioned, that we are not really assuming kind of a fall booster/third shot.

And as Matt was just saying, it's a little early to get into specific specifics, as you can imagine. 2022 in this dynamic environment is a ways away. But having said that, we feel confident around the durability of our COVID revenues. 
So let me try and lay this out a little bit. As I mentioned, we think we entered 2022 with $1 billion in vaccine and therapeutic backlog. And the potential upside that we talked about based on the assumptions, not including boosters, not including kids being vaccinated, nor including at this point, other vaccine programs that might be earlier stage in the pipeline. If you think about that in our very, very broad portfolio, both in terms of upstream and downstream solutions, independent of the vaccine or therapeutic modality, we really see that we're very well positioned there. And that $1 billion backlog is sort of the beginning of that story. 
Now as we think about testing, so diagnostic testing for COVID, COVID is going to be or is already endemic, and we'll be testing at the point of care for a long time. And so while some folks are talking about 2021 being a peak year for testing for the market, we think Cepheid is uniquely positioned. You recall my example of the concentric circles with the highest durability tests being in the center, representing really Cepheid's point-of-care workflow.  
And as you think about Cepheid expanded installed base, the very strong menu that we have, we believe that we'll do roughly the same number of tests in 2022 as we are doing in 2021. And you'll recall, we just raised that from 36 million to 45 million tests.  
And then if you think about our base business, here, we really are and continue to be exposed to a number of attractive secular growth drivers. Biologics, more generally in life science research, along with molecular diagnostics and the decentralization of health care. And then, of course, environmental sustainability as you think about our water quality group and packaging needs continue to proliferate.  
So net-net, we feel we're uniquely positioned to outperform in 2021 and beyond."

And a simple frame if we start at the top there would be that we see the full year base business now at high single-digit core growth and full year COVID tailwinds to be",628,"Sure, Doug. So let's come back to the full year guide going from mid- to high teens. And a simple frame if we start at the top there would be that we see the full year base business now at high single-digit core growth and full year COVID tailwinds to be in the high single, low double digits.  
Now if we start with the base business, we see that sustaining certainly at the current levels with customer activity around the world continuing to resume and approaching pre-pandemic levels. And then, of course, customers are adapting to this new work environment, and we see that in the form of strong sales funnels and our order book growth. Even service levels are at or near normal as we have much better site access than we have had for more normalized operation. And we're also seeing an uptick in instrument revenue as customers are starting to initiate new projects, upgrading and doing some capital investments.  
Now as I've mentioned here just a minute ago, from a COVID testing perspective, we still see the point-of-care testing at Cepheid easy workflow, the right answer being in short turnaround being the solution, the durable solution. And we see Cepheid actually accelerating here to 45 million tests versus the 36 million tests that we've spoken about. So we're seeing no falloff in demand for Cepheid tests.  
And the way to think about that is we did about 10 million here in Q1 and expect to increase by 1 million about each quarter. So 11 million in Q2, 12 million in Q3 and 13 million in Q4. And an important point to recognize here is our mix in Q1, COVID only versus foreign one was 50-50. Now as we go into the summer months here in the Northern Hemisphere, we see that mix going from 50-50 in Q1 to 80-20, 80 COVID, [ only 20 for 1 ], for Q2 and Q3. And then for Q4, we see that going back to -- as we enter flu season and so forth, back to 50-50. So keep that in mind from a mix assumption perspective. 
Now if you look at this by segment, we see the Life Sciences growing over 20% here for the full year. Of course, bioprocessing that's non-COVID related, remains robust in the low double digits. As we've talked about, we're seeing our instruments improving. So if you think of like a microsystem, think about SCIEX, trends improved through 2021 as these projects are resuming as we speak and return to work. And then of course, the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics revenues we just talked about of about $2 billion. 
As you think about Diagnostics, here, we see ourselves in the high teens. Point of care, I talked about the expected 45 million tests at Cepheid as that capacity continues to build here through the year. And in our core and reference lab businesses, we see the volumes continuing to recover and the lockdown is really not having a material impact. So thinking about Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems in the low double digits here for the full year. And then from an EAS perspective, we see that in the mid single to high single digits as the consumables demand remains solid as it has been, but now we're starting to see equipment placements improving as well and in positive growth territories. 
And then lastly, if you build it out by geography, China, up over 20% for the year with a very strong recovery. North America, also in high teens, with Western Europe at low double digits. So that's how we're thinking about the frame here, by business as well as by geography as well as base and COVID tailwind. Hopefully, that helps with that."

We see no slowdown in the demand for Cepheid tests for COVID. So while the market, as I mentioned earlier, might peak this year in terms of testing, and we'll see if that's the case. But if we take that assumption, we continue to see that the value proposition that Cepheid offers at the point of care and as those tests wander from more distant testing setting back to the point of care that Cepheid's value proposition there in terms of workflow, speed and accuracy are really in the center of that concentric circle, and it's really -- that's so important here to keep in mind. 
Also, we've increased the installed base of the gene experts now since the beginning of last year by over 40%. So a significant installed base increase. And that's actually the largest installed base of molecular diagnostics point-of-care test around the globe. At the same time, our broad menu, 30 tests approved outside the U.S., 20 inside of the U.S., is getting us into a care setting that we expect to provide strong durability here for the future. So that's what allows us here as we continue to increase capacity quarter-over-quarter to continue to increase our shipments. 
And as you think about 2022 going forward, first of all, the vaccines will take likely years to roll out to the entire world. Secondly, their effectiveness is on a continuum, some of them as high as 95%, others in the mid-60s. And so we're already seeing breakthrough infection. And there's also a number of people around the world who prefer not to get vaccinated. So testing will be continuing and very likely so at the point of care. And that just gives us the confidence based also on our conversations with our customers who are giving us outlook here for the next 18 to 24 months, that we're going to be able to maintain in 2022, the level of test shipment that we had here in 2021. So 45 million is what we're looking for, for 2021. 
Now as we think about -- to your question on total capacity, is capacity tight? I think certainly, we are running very hard. But as I've mentioned in other settings, we have invested continuously here over the last 18 months in expanding our capacity. If we think about Cytiva in particular, even prior to the close with GE, we had an arrangement where we continued to increase capacity, and we've continued to invest very significantly in those capacity increases. So we're working together with our customers and our suppliers to make sure that we're able to supply the needs here in 2021 and going forward. 
Now to the other aspect of your question, once you have this capacity online, should vaccination and therapeutics peak, how do we think about that capacity going forward? And here, again, we're very bullish based on the development pipeline of biologic drugs, which continues to grow significantly. So even if you put COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics aside, the capacity requirements going forward continue to be significant. We're very confident that the capacity investments that we make today and tomorrow are very much needed here to supply the future needs of our customers. And they're certainly in dialogue with us specifically on that point."

There's a number of data points to consider here. Let me start with the fact that biologic drugs are highly efficacious and in very great demand, and that the penetration of these drugs throughout the world is still in the single-digit percentages, again, speaking now outside of COVID vaccine. So the penetration of these highly efficacious drug is still relatively low.  
On the other hand, when you look at the surge of capital investment that we see going into drug development, whether that be in traditional pharma or small biotech and throughout the world, we see that the drug pipeline and the associated number of drugs in the clinical -- in clinical trials continues to ramp very significantly. And even if you apply sort of traditional success rates to the number of projects in those pipelines, you have to expect a very, very solid and continued growth here for the future, and we certainly do. And we expect that growth to be in the low double digits here on a sustained basis. 
And if you have any sort of additional leverage here as it relates to the transition from, for instance, stainless steel manufacturing solutions to single-use technologies for greater flexibility and ease of use and lower risk of cross-contamination, that provides additional impulses and catalysts to the growth rate, which will require the capacity that you see coming online.

In the first quarter of 2021, we got off to a very strong start, delivering better-than-expected core revenue growth across our portfolio. Our broad-based performance was driven by double-digit core revenue growth in our base business, our ongoing contributions to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and strong demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular diagnostic tests. Our record top line performance also contributed to outstanding earnings per share growth and free cash flow generation. Our well-rounded first quarter results are a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our commitment to continuous improvement. 
We have an exceptional collection of market-leading franchises and technologies all powered by the Danaher Business System, that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage. 
So with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. We generated $6.9 billion of sales in the first quarter with 30% core revenue growth. All 3 of our reporting segments delivered better-than-expected growth, led by Life Sciences and Diagnostics. We believe we continue to capture market share, particularly at some of our larger businesses, including Cytiva, Pall, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, Hach and Videojet. 
Over the last several years, we've prioritized high-impact growth investments in innovation, sales and marketing, to ensure that we're well positioned both near and long term. Through new product introductions and the impact of our Danaher Business System growth tools, we've enhanced our competitive advantage and believe we've achieved notable market share gain. 
Geographically, revenue growth was broad-based across both developed and high-growth markets.  We saw over 20% growth in the developed market, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up more than 45%, largely driven by the recovery in China. Our gross profit margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 62% in the first quarter, largely due to higher sales volumes and the positive impact of higher-margin product mix. Our operating profit margin of 29.1% was up 1,300 basis points year-over-year, including more than 900 basis points of core margin expansion as a result of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses as we continue to see limited travel and other related costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.52 were up 140% versus last year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 135% year-over-year. 
Now in the first quarter, we deployed more than $400 million of capital towards mergers and acquisitions across all 3 segments. Most notably, IDT and Cytiva completed their first bolt-on acquisition with IDT adding Swift Biosciences, which brings complementary capabilities and a broad portfolio of next-gen sequencing library preparation and enrichment solutions for DNA, RNA and methylated DNA samples. And Cytiva acquired Vanrx Pharmasystems, which provides innovative, automated aseptic tolling technologies used to fill vials, syringes and cartridges, a critical final step to complete the bioprocessing workflow. We also continued to make significant organic investments and high-impact growth initiatives across all of Danaher. 
Over the past 6 months, we've invested in a meaningful expansion of production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva, Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences. Near term, these investments will support COVID-related demand, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses, where we see tremendous runway ahead given the underlying growth drivers and the durability of the markets they serve. Between these 4 businesses, we're investing more than $1 billion in 2021 to continue to meet our customers' needs today and well into the future. 
So now let's take a look -- a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 115% as a result of the Cytiva acquisition, and core revenue was up 41.5%. We saw strong double-digit core revenue growth across all of our largest operating companies in the platform, led by Cytiva, Pall Life Sciences, Beckman Life Sciences and IDT. 
In our bioprocessing businesses, accelerating demand for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutic development and production drove a combined core revenue growth rate of more than 60% at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Excluding the impact of COVID-related activity, our underlying biopharma business grew in the low 20s range. We believe that our ability to continue meeting customers' needs across their bioprocessing workflows enabled us to gain market share in the quarter, particularly within our cell culture media and single-use product line. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 34%, and core revenue grew 31%. Each of our largest operating companies in the platform achieved high single digit or better core revenue growth, led by Cepheid, which achieved more than 90% core revenue growth. In response to the unprecedented demand for Cepheid's rapid point-of-care molecular test, the team again increased production capacity and shipped over 10 million respiratory test cartridges in the first quarter. Roughly half of the tests shipped were COVID-only tests, and the other half were 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19 Flu A, Flu B and RSV. We also saw increasing demand for nonrespiratory tests across Cepheid's market-leading test menu, including sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and urology, demonstrating the broad applicability of Cepheid's molecular diagnostic offering. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 3.5%. Our Water Quality platform was up slightly and product identification was up high single digits. Our Water Quality businesses support customers' day-to-day mission-critical water operations, providing water testing, treatment and analysis across a variety of applications around the world. We saw good underlying demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables during the quarter, and we're encouraged by the improvement in equipment sales, which returned to growth as customers got back up and running at more normalized levels. 
In Product Identification, we saw mid single-digit core revenue growth in our marking and coding businesses and double-digit growth in packaging and color management. Esko and X-Rite benefited from the underlying market recovery and saw good momentum from customers initiating new projects and investments in the first quarter. 
So with that context from what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look -- walk through some of the trends we're seeing across our end markets and geographies. Customer activity around the world is approaching pre-pandemic levels as we all collectively adapt to working in this new environment. We're seeing this in the form of strong sales funnels and order book growth. Service levels at or near pre-pandemic levels and an uptick in equipment revenues. While some of this dynamic is a result of pent-up demand in the wake of widespread lockdowns, we're starting to see underlying recovery across most of our end markets that were impacted. 
Now if we take a closer look at these dynamics by geography, China appears to be the furthest along in terms of reopening, with activity levels largely back to normal. The U.S. is not all the way back just yet, but is moving in the right direction. And an increase in vaccination rates across the country appear to be driving some of this progress. Europe is improving broadly. And while certain areas have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, we've not seen any material impact. 
In Life Sciences, activity in the broader biopharma market remains robust. There has not been any slowdown in the double-digit growth trend we've seen over the last several quarters across non-COVID-related biopharma activity. Within COVID-related biopharma activity, the significant ramp-up of vaccines and therapeutics is driving record bioprocessing demand. We're involved in the majority of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic projects underway around the world today, including all of those in the U.S. that are currently on the market or in later-stage clinical trials. Our operating companies are playing a significant role in the development and production of new therapies and vaccines across the biopharma pipeline. And given the breadth of our offering and the production capacity we're adding in 2021, we're uniquely positioned to support our customers in their mission today and well into the future, which is to make more life-saving treatment available to more patients faster. 
In clinical diagnostics, we continue to see heightened demand for rapid point-of-care molecular testing. As we look across the COVID-19 testing landscape and consider the durability of the demand that we're seeing, we believe that Cepheid's positioning is the strongest amongst the various testing modalities and settings. Cepheid's leading presence at the point of care, combined with the speed, accuracy and workflow advantages of their molecular offering, uniquely positions the business to support customers' testing needs, not only for COVID-19, but beyond the pandemic as well. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major geographies as elective procedures and hospital visits have rebounded from last year. Consumables growth is accelerating as a result, and we're encouraged by the momentum of instrument placement. 
Finally, in the applied market, consumables remain solid across essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food and medicine. And growth is picking up on the equipment side as customers get back to more normal operations and initiate capital investments. 
Now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver second quarter core revenue growth in the mid-20s range. We anticipate low double-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a low double-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to have operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2021. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver high teens core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will be a high single-digit to low double-digit contribution to the core revenue growth rate. This would include an estimated $2 billion of 2021 revenue at Cytiva and Pall Biotech associated with vaccines and therapeutics, which is higher than our previous expectation of $1.3 billion. And at Cepheid, we'll continue ramping capacity through the year and now expect to ship approximately 45 million tests in 2021 compared to our prior estimate of 36 million tests. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up high single digits for the full year. 
So to wrap up, we had a very strong start to the year and feel good about the momentum we're seeing across all of Danaher. Our first quarter results are a testament to the commitment and capability of our team and a durable, balanced positioning of our portfolio. We believe this combination differentiates Danaher and sets us up well to outperform in 2021 and beyond. In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we'll strive to keep building an even better, stronger company and to positively impact the world around us in meaningful ways for all of our stakeholders. We see tremendous opportunities ahead to do just that. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

And as Matt was just saying, it's a little early to get into specific specifics, as you can imagine. 2022 in this dynamic environment is a ways away. But having said that, we feel confident around the durability of our COVID revenues. 
So let me try and lay this out a little bit. As I mentioned, we think we entered 2022 with $1 billion in vaccine and therapeutic backlog. And the potential upside that we talked about based on the assumptions, not including boosters, not including kids being vaccinated, nor including at this point, other vaccine programs that might be earlier stage in the pipeline. If you think about that in our very, very broad portfolio, both in terms of upstream and downstream solutions, independent of the vaccine or therapeutic modality, we really see that we're very well positioned there. And that $1 billion backlog is sort of the beginning of that story. 
Now as we think about testing, so diagnostic testing for COVID, COVID is going to be or is already endemic, and we'll be testing at the point of care for a long time. And so while some folks are talking about 2021 being a peak year for testing for the market, we think Cepheid is uniquely positioned. You recall my example of the concentric circles with the highest durability tests being in the center, representing really Cepheid's point-of-care workflow.  
And as you think about Cepheid expanded installed base, the very strong menu that we have, we believe that we'll do roughly the same number of tests in 2022 as we are doing in 2021. And you'll recall, we just raised that from 36 million to 45 million tests.  
And then if you think about our base business, here, we really are and continue to be exposed to a number of attractive secular growth drivers. Biologics, more generally in life science research, along with molecular diagnostics and the decentralization of health care. And then, of course, environmental sustainability as you think about our water quality group and packaging needs continue to proliferate.  
So net-net, we feel we're uniquely positioned to outperform in 2021 and beyond."

So let's come back to the full year guide going from mid- to high teens. And a simple frame if we start at the top there would be that we see the full year base business now at high single-digit core growth and full year COVID tailwinds to be in the high single, low double digits.  
Now if we start with the base business, we see that sustaining certainly at the current levels with customer activity around the world continuing to resume and approaching pre-pandemic levels. And then, of course, customers are adapting to this new work environment, and we see that in the form of strong sales funnels and our order book growth. Even service levels are at or near normal as we have much better site access than we have had for more normalized operation. And we're also seeing an uptick in instrument revenue as customers are starting to initiate new projects, upgrading and doing some capital investments.  
Now as I've mentioned here just a minute ago, from a COVID testing perspective, we still see the point-of-care testing at Cepheid easy workflow, the right answer being in short turnaround being the solution, the durable solution. And we see Cepheid actually accelerating here to 45 million tests versus the 36 million tests that we've spoken about. So we're seeing no falloff in demand for Cepheid tests.  
And the way to think about that is we did about 10 million here in Q1 and expect to increase by 1 million about each quarter. So 11 million in Q2, 12 million in Q3 and 13 million in Q4. And an important point to recognize here is our mix in Q1, COVID only versus foreign one was 50-50. Now as we go into the summer months here in the Northern Hemisphere, we see that mix going from 50-50 in Q1 to 80-20, 80 COVID, [ only 20 for 1 ], for Q2 and Q3. And then for Q4, we see that going back to -- as we enter flu season and so forth, back to 50-50. So keep that in mind from a mix assumption perspective. 
Now if you look at this by segment, we see the Life Sciences growing over 20% here for the full year. Of course, bioprocessing that's non-COVID related, remains robust in the low double digits. As we've talked about, we're seeing our instruments improving. So if you think of like a microsystem, think about SCIEX, trends improved through 2021 as these projects are resuming as we speak and return to work. And then of course, the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics revenues we just talked about of about $2 billion. 
As you think about Diagnostics, here, we see ourselves in the high teens. Point of care, I talked about the expected 45 million tests at Cepheid as that capacity continues to build here through the year. And in our core and reference lab businesses, we see the volumes continuing to recover and the lockdown is really not having a material impact. So thinking about Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems in the low double digits here for the full year. And then from an EAS perspective, we see that in the mid single to high single digits as the consumables demand remains solid as it has been, but now we're starting to see equipment placements improving as well and in positive growth territories. 
And then lastly, if you build it out by geography, China, up over 20% for the year with a very strong recovery. North America, also in high teens, with Western Europe at low double digits. So that's how we're thinking about the frame here, by business as well as by geography as well as base and COVID tailwind. Hopefully, that helps with that."

Just what -- can you share with us kind of where you are today from a total capacity in terms of being able to meet the demand that you see? How tight things are? And then as eventually COVID flows with the additional capacity building out, kind of how does that filter into the base bioproduction business?"

We see no slowdown in the demand for Cepheid tests for COVID. So while the market, as I mentioned earlier, might peak this year in terms of testing, and we'll see if that's the case. But if we take that assumption, we continue to see that the value proposition that Cepheid offers at the point of care and as those tests wander from more distant testing setting back to the point of care that Cepheid's value proposition there in terms of workflow, speed and accuracy are really in the center of that concentric circle, and it's really -- that's so important here to keep in mind. 
Also, we've increased the installed base of the gene experts now since the beginning of last year by over 40%. So a significant installed base increase. And that's actually the largest installed base of molecular diagnostics point-of-care test around the globe. At the same time, our broad menu, 30 tests approved outside the U.S., 20 inside of the U.S., is getting us into a care setting that we expect to provide strong durability here for the future. So that's what allows us here as we continue to increase capacity quarter-over-quarter to continue to increase our shipments. 
And as you think about 2022 going forward, first of all, the vaccines will take likely years to roll out to the entire world. Secondly, their effectiveness is on a continuum, some of them as high as 95%, others in the mid-60s. And so we're already seeing breakthrough infection. And there's also a number of people around the world who prefer not to get vaccinated. So testing will be continuing and very likely so at the point of care. And that just gives us the confidence based also on our conversations with our customers who are giving us outlook here for the next 18 to 24 months, that we're going to be able to maintain in 2022, the level of test shipment that we had here in 2021. So 45 million is what we're looking for, for 2021. 
Now as we think about -- to your question on total capacity, is capacity tight? I think certainly, we are running very hard. But as I've mentioned in other settings, we have invested continuously here over the last 18 months in expanding our capacity. If we think about Cytiva in particular, even prior to the close with GE, we had an arrangement where we continued to increase capacity, and we've continued to invest very significantly in those capacity increases. So we're working together with our customers and our suppliers to make sure that we're able to supply the needs here in 2021 and going forward. 
Now to the other aspect of your question, once you have this capacity online, should vaccination and therapeutics peak, how do we think about that capacity going forward? And here, again, we're very bullish based on the development pipeline of biologic drugs, which continues to grow significantly. So even if you put COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics aside, the capacity requirements going forward continue to be significant. We're very confident that the capacity investments that we make today and tomorrow are very much needed here to supply the future needs of our customers. And they're certainly in dialogue with us specifically on that point."

There's a number of data points to consider here. Let me start with the fact that biologic drugs are highly efficacious and in very great demand, and that the penetration of these drugs throughout the world is still in the single-digit percentages, again, speaking now outside of COVID vaccine. So the penetration of these highly efficacious drug is still relatively low.  
On the other hand, when you look at the surge of capital investment that we see going into drug development, whether that be in traditional pharma or small biotech and throughout the world, we see that the drug pipeline and the associated number of drugs in the clinical -- in clinical trials continues to ramp very significantly. And even if you apply sort of traditional success rates to the number of projects in those pipelines, you have to expect a very, very solid and continued growth here for the future, and we certainly do. And we expect that growth to be in the low double digits here on a sustained basis. 
And if you have any sort of additional leverage here as it relates to the transition from, for instance, stainless steel manufacturing solutions to single-use technologies for greater flexibility and ease of use and lower risk of cross-contamination, that provides additional impulses and catalysts to the growth rate, which will require the capacity that you see coming online.

We saw broad-based strength across the portfolio, which helped us deliver over 30% core revenue growth, more than 70% adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding free cash flow generation. This well-rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day. 
During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through significant high-impact organic growth investments and enhanced our portfolio with strategic growth-accelerating acquisitions. We prioritized innovation across Danaher and increased our production capabilities, all of which we believe contributed to the market share gains in several of our businesses. 
We also announced our pending acquisition of Aldevron, which will expand our presence into the fast-growing and important frontier of genomic medicine. Putting it all together, we believe the combination of our leading portfolio and DBS-driven execution differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance. 
So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion, and we delivered core revenue growth of 31.5% with strong contributions from all 3 of our reporting segments. Geographically, high-growth markets grew nearly 35% and developed markets were up more than 25%. Revenue in each of our 3 largest markets, North America, Western Europe and China, was up 30% or more in the quarter. Our gross profit margin increased by 710 basis points to 60.9%, primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher-margin product mix and the impact of prior year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. Our operating profit margin increased to 27.8%, including 775 basis points core operating margin expansion, primarily as a result of higher gross margin and continued lower operating expense as travel and other related costs remain below pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.46 were up 71% compared to 2020. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up over 40% year-over-year. 
In June, we announced our intention to acquire Aldevron, a producer of high-quality plasma DNA, mRNA and protein serving academic biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers. The addition of Aldevron will expand our capabilities into the important field of genomic medicine where we're seeing the accelerated adoption of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and gene editing technologies. We anticipate Aldevron will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels as we expect the business to generate $500 million of revenue in 2022 with more than 20% annual revenue growth and a strong margin profile. We look forward to welcoming this incredibly talented and innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes. 
In addition to announcing the Aldevron acquisition, we also accelerated several organic growth investments across the portfolio. One of our core values at Danaher is innovation defines our future. And we have made a significant commitment toward our research and development efforts, increasing our research and development spend by more than 30% year-over-year to bring more impactful solutions to our customers. 
At SCIEX, we launched the Xenitop7600, a high-resolution, accurate mass spectrometry system that enables scientists to identify, characterize and quantify molecules at previously undetectable levels, helping to advance the development of new biotherapeutics and precision diagnostics. 
At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, we recently introduced the DxA 5000 Fit, a compact automation solution designed for small and mid-sized laboratories that reduces up to 80% of the manual steps typically required for sample preparation. These are just a few great examples of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher to support our customers and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation. 
Additionally, we're making substantial investments to expand capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and Cepheid. Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand, driven by both the market and meaningful share gains, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see tremendous runway ahead given the underlying structural growth drivers in the markets they serve. We expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' needs today and well into the future. We believe the strategic combination of these organic and inorganic investments across our portfolio will reinforce our competitive advantage and accelerate our growth trajectory going forward. 
Now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life Sciences' reported revenue increased 41.5% with core revenue up 35%. This growth was broad-based with most of our major businesses in the platform delivering 30% or better core growth. We continue to see strong demand for our bioprocessing solutions with core combined revenue growth of more than 40% at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our non-COVID-related bioprocessing business was up low double digits where we saw robust customer activity and order rates. COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenues were consistent with the first quarter and exceeded $1 billion over the first 6 months of the year. 
So I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to reflect on Cytiva's fantastic first year as part of Danaher. We've established a new company with a new brand name, added more than 1,500 associates and made substantial progress in the transition to Danaher, all while maintaining world-class support of our customers, significantly ramping production capacity and growing revenue by more than 50%. When we announced the acquisition, we talked about the strategic and value-creation opportunities we saw and were excited to welcome such a talented and engaged team to Danaher. I think it's fair to say they've exceeded our expectations in every way. And that's really a testament to the Cytiva team who've embraced Danaher and the Danaher Business System and continued to execute exceptionally in support of our customers. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 40.5% and core revenue grew 37%, led by more than 50% core growth at Cepheid. Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems each grew more than 30% as patient volumes and clinical diagnostic activity approached prepandemic levels around the world. At Cepheid, growth outside of respiratory testing was led by our sexual health and hospital-acquired infection assays, particularly among newly acquired Cepheid customers. In respiratory testing, we believe we continue to gain market share as expanded manufacturing capacity enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 14 million cartridges in the quarter. As expected, COVID-only tests accounted for approximately 80% of these shipments, while our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 20%. This broad-based performance across Cepheid was driven by the team's thoughtful install base expansion over the last 15 months and is evidence of the significant value Cepheid provides to clinicians with the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class, easy-to-use workflow at the point of care. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 15.5% and core revenue was up 13%. Revenue growth accelerated across both platforms, with Water Quality up high single digits and Product Identification up approximately 20% in the quarter. In our Water Quality businesses, demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by improving activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end markets. Equipment order rates accelerated as customers got back up and running and began to invest in larger projects. In Product Identification, Videojet was up mid-teens, and our packaging and color management businesses were up more than 25% in the quarter. This acceleration reflected a broad-based recovery with growth across most major geographies and end markets. 
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through trends geographically and across our end markets. Looking at conditions around the world, most major regions and countries have broadly returned to or are approaching normal operations. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the U.S., Europe and China. That said, we're mindful of the emerging COVID-19 variants driving further outbreaks and have taken actions to help minimize the potential impact on our respective businesses. And at this point, we've seen no material impact from recent variance or selective lockdown. 
We saw positive momentum across our businesses with order growth trending above revenue growth. Most of our end markets have largely recovered with growth rates at or above pre-pandemic levels as customers have adopted to the new environment. In-person commercial activity continues to rebound, and we're seeing our teams spend more time on site with their customers, a trend we expect to continue as we move through the year. Across Life Sciences, we're seeing healthy demand in most of our end markets, led by biopharma where the pace of customer activity remains elevated. Biotech funding levels are robust, and the number of life-saving biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise and is further augmented by the work around COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is more than 50% increase from just 5 years ago. We also see over 1,000 gene therapy candidates in development today, a tenfold increase over the last several years as these technologies mature and therapies gain regulatory approval. Given that many of these candidates are still in early-stage research, we expect the growth rate of this market to remain strong for many years to come. 
In addition to the growth in biologic- and genomic-based medicines, there is significant demand related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, both on the market and in development today. Given the interest we're seeing from customers looking to address emerging variants and increased global supply as well as evolving vaccination guidelines globally, we expect to see durable growth in this segment of the biopharma market for the foreseeable future. 
At the current pace of vaccination, it's clear that vaccine demand will continue well into next year. We expect to recognize $2 billion in COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021 and anticipate entering 2022 with approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-related backlog. These assumptions do not include the potential contribution from booster shot or an expansion of availability to populations under 12-year old due to the level of uncertainty around each of these scenarios. Given the growing numbers of drug being developed and the increasing scientific sophistication required to discover and manufacture these complex therapies, customers are looking to partner with vendors who can reliably supply them with solutions for their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale. Our comprehensive bioprocessing portfolio and scientific expertise positions us well to do just that. And we're confident our proactive investments in innovation and capacity will help us meet this growing customer demand now and far into the future. 
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. In Molecular Diagnostics, while PCR respiratory testing volumes in the U.S. have declined, we're seeing persistent demand for Cepheid's testing at the point of care. Outside of the U.S., which makes up approximately half of Cepheid's revenue, we continue to see strong demand for our testing as vaccination rates lag and emerging variants drive outbreaks. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 14 million respiratory tests during the second quarter, up from 10 million shipped in the first quarter, and we now expect to ship approximately 50 million tests in 2021. Looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. And given Cepheid's leading positioning around speed, accuracy and the ease-of-use workflow advantages, we believe we'll continue to gain market share. The combination of these market share gains, the expansion of Cephead's leading global install base and the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market creates significant opportunities ahead for broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing solutions. 
Moving to the applied market. We're seeing a continuation of the steady improvement over the first half of the year. Customer activity is accelerating in line with broader economic activity, which we see in healthy order rates for consumables and increasing investments in equipment. Across municipal markets globally, consumable demand remains solid as customers continue to test and treat water, and instrument-oriented project activity is accelerating with the improving funding environment. 
Now let's look ahead to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver third quarter core revenue growth in the mid- to high-teens range. We anticipate high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the third quarter and for the remainder of 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver approximately 20% core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will be an approximately 10% contribution to the core revenue growth rate. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up to 10% for the full year, an increase from our prior expectation of high single digits. 
So to wrap up, we've had a great start to the year, and we see meaningful opportunities across Danaher to build upon this outstanding performance. Our second quarter results reiterate the power of our portfolio and our exceptional team, a unique combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable, long-term outperformance. 
And with that, back to you, Matt."

Rainer, I think one of the debates around the stock is still around the testing outlook in particular around 2022 perception. I know you came out of the first quarter and talked about the fact you thought trends would be sustainable heading into next year. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the field? How you're thinking about variance in the near term? And what gives you confidence in the outlook for 2022? Obviously, you're more in a hospital. It's PCR, not antigens, so we get all those dynamics. But I think there's still some debate as to whether testing could drop off more significantly next year."

Look, as we think about the remainder of 2021 and how that sets us up for 2022, just a couple of things to sort of set the baseline here. First of all, we now expect to ship 50 million tests in 2021 for COVID,",361,"Sure, Tycho, and thank you for that question. Look, as we think about the remainder of 2021 and how that sets us up for 2022, just a couple of things to sort of set the baseline here. First of all, we now expect to ship 50 million tests in 2021 for COVID, either COVID only or 4 in 1. And that, we've taken that up from the 45 million test guide before. 
And the confidence that we gain here is really through what we've seen. As we've ramped up our capacity here and shipped 14 million cartridges in Q2, recall, we originally expected to ship 11 million in Q2, 50% of that outside of the U.S., 50% of that inside the U.S. That really has given us the confidence that there's still plenty of demand for our solution at the point-of-care. And here's why, we're really not perceiving a slowdown currently in our testing demand, and we're shipping everything that we're producing. So while it's true that we see lab -- core lab tests, trending downward, we continue to see strength in the demand for our testing solution. 
The other thing that we are considering here is we're a bit concerned about some of the RSV breakouts that we're seeing in the U.S., but also elsewhere in the world, which makes us think that we'll start seeing testing skew more towards the 4-in-1 solution, which, of course, tests for RSV in addition to Flu A, B and COVID-19. So as we think about where we sit today, we feel comfortable that we'll see 50 million tests this year. And we don't have anything that would indicate that our previous guide for 45 million tests in 2022 would be materially different. We continue to see plenty of opportunity. Keep in mind, we've increased our install base by 40% since the installation -- since beginning the of the pandemic and, of course, have the largest testing menu with 30-plus tests in outside the U.S. and 20-plus tests in the U.S. So we feel strongly that, that demand should be available to us once again because of that unique value proposition at the point-of-care."

But what Rainer said around the RSV sort of outbreak here that we're seeing in the South, we think we might have a little bit of a different or more of a respiratory season than we did last year.

Keep in mind, SCIEX over 30% core growth here in Q2, just as a marker, but really all of our major Life Science operating companies were at or over 30% core growth for the quarter. So we're seeing some very nice momentum there. 
And if you look at the 2-year growth stack there, we're really at or very near to pre-pandemic growth rate. A lot of this is driven by more customer activity.

I suspect we might be something in between those 2 numbers, maybe we're at the higher end of that number, the $850 million and the $1.5 billion as we head into next year. But I think over time, that probably does start to come down a touch. As we've talked about, we've been pulling forward a lot of the capacity increases that we were already planning for all of those businesses just given the demand now plus the longer-term secular growth driver. So this is sort of more of a pull-forward is the way I think about it.

Maybe one on vaccines and bioprocessing, Rainer. The commentary around backlog, exit backlog stepping up for the year in light of 2Q, it feels like maybe the order conversion, maybe that's stepping down in the back half. And is that the right way? This is just more of a timing thing that we're thinking about on the vaccine side when you think about the revenue cadence? And then ex vaccines, when you think about base bioprocessing, we just had a major Alzheimer's drug approval. I'm curious what it does to either industry growth or perhaps your business?"

So just to level set, we expect to do and for vaccines and therapeutics this year $2 billion in revenue. And that second half is going to be consistent with what you saw in the first half. And so the activity level remains elevated. And any detail that you're thinking about is purely related to comps. And now more broadly speaking really for total Danaher, the Q2, Q3 prior year step-up is over 1,000 basis points, right? So if you keep that in mind, I think that characterizes the activity level appropriately. We continue to see strength in vaccine and therapeutic. Orders, Matt talked about it with Tycho, 40% plus on the revenue side in Q2, 60% plus on the order side. So the activity level remains very high. And we expect that this will continue, which is why we're confident in talking about $1.5 billion of backlog for 2022, which sitting here on July '20, looking forward, is a good place for us to be. And it gives us, as you think about 2022, a number of quarters to continue to strengthen that. So there's a great deal going on in the vaccine and therapeutic space. Keep in mind, the rollout that we've seen has been primarily a developed market story. We're starting now to see some of the emerging market vaccine manufacturers kicking in and ramping up. There's 3 in China to take an example, another 1 in Russia, of course, and several more. And they're just starting to kick in. So we expect that all to provide really some sustained strength for some period of time."

As you know, there's quite a bit of discussion around the efficacy of the drug, the size of the target population, reimbursement and a number of other questions. 
But I might say that this is one drug. There are several others that are in late-stage qualification and approval processes. And so we do see here this indication of Alzheimer's disease becoming more and more relevant for monoclonal antibodies. Awfully early to say what impact it has, but we can say that with the breadth of our portfolio, the capability of our team and the penetration that we have in the market, it's fair to say that we're represented on all of those projects and are confident that we can supply those should there be an elevated need."

And so I think in my mind, it's a question of -- there's 2 things. It's when do the costs come back because I do believe we will have some costs come back, and how fast that happens. So it's just really kind of balancing those 2. I think there's still enough uncertainty out there that it's difficult to pin that down.

But we are definitely seeing that. We are seeing it in resins, in plastics, in metals. Again, not a huge part for us, but we do see it where that happens. 
I think the 2 biggest pieces for us, Scott, our freight is definitely an issue. Fewer cargo flights, obviously, means it's a little bit more expensive to move things by air. And then I think as everybody has read and saw electronics, particularly in the supply chain around the chips globally, has been a challenge for us as well. So again, haven't seen a material impact. I do believe that as we move forward into the second half, that probably does not abate, if anything, might step up a little bit and clearly a challenge here for us.

So on Cepheid, there was an earlier question on the outlook for testing volume in 2022. As you've noted before, your GeneXpert install base increased by about 40% since the beginning of the pandemic. You've also previously talked about your efforts to be as smart as you can about where you place boxes. Essentially, the goal has been to as much as possible pull-forward placements, especially in areas of the world where we may have been under indexed in an effort to make sure that these instruments are used durably over the long term. I was wondering if you could share some specific data on how you're having success with newer accounts driving utilization of these boxes for non-COVID-19 purposes? And additionally, is it possible that there are some new assays coming over the coming quarters that might move you into additional testing categories that also boost your confidence in the outlook for durability? I ask because right before the pandemic got going, we had picked up on some signs that there were some notable advancements being made on assay development initiatives, including some of those talked about in the past by old Cepheid management, which would greatly increase the TAM for the company. I think a lot of lingering concerns about this category would be further assuaged by combining what we saw in Q2, which was really strong with the outlook for assay menu expansion and some positive signs in terms of what's going on with newer accounts."

Once again, we've increased our install base here since the beginning of the pandemic by 40% plus. And that's put thousands of instruments in places where they haven't been before. And we've tried to do that very strategically, always, of course, wanting to help with the COVID pandemic and the near-term requirements and needs, but also looking beyond that to see whether those care settings would be able to use the menu that we have available today and the one that, of course, we develop every day in order to launch new assays. And we have seen that starting to play out in places where perhaps the COVID need is not as strong and particularly at new customers. And that's manifested, for instance, in our sexual health or our hospital-acquired infections assays, which are up 30% plus here in the second quarter and provide us with an additional pillar of strength. And so we're very pleased with that, and we expect that to continue here as we not only make progress in the U.S., but in the rest of the world. So a very important point. The menu is gaining traction, and we're starting to see that play out here in the second quarter and expect that to continue to be the case going forward.

You guys talked about it a few times. The expected backlog heading into '22 is $1.5 billion. The potential for upside, I think, seems pretty clear specific to COVID. That said, there is still some investor uncertainty with regards to what happens if demand were slow in this category. A basic but important question, if demand were to slow for COVID-related products and services in this category, is it fair to say that you're comfortable that there is enough demand more broadly across biopharma to essentially compensate for that? I mean our thinking has been, this has been an area where there just hasn't been enough good supply of products and services, and that's presented you with a fantastic opportunity to basically solve that problem. Even if the COVID demand were to slow, presumably, you're still going to be able to essentially reallocate these products and services for other purposes. Is that a fair way of thinking about things?"

And before we move on to the non-COVID strength out there, let's reiterate in relation to that backlog number that we talked about, what assumptions are in that and which assumptions are not in that number. So in that $1.5 billion backlog, that's in addition to the $2 billion that we're shipping this year. That includes all the approved vaccines, whether those are approved in the U.S. and Europe or elsewhere as well as those in late-stage trials, which you can imagine we're very close to. So that's absolutely a part of how we're thinking about that. It includes these emerging market vaccines that I was talking about. But what it doesn't include is a booster shot. And we know from Israel, we know from the U.K., we know from China that those countries are now moving to booster shot. But we have not assumed that to be a part of our numbers here. Nor have we included the younger kids 12 and under in a vaccination schedule, which you can imagine on a worldwide basis is a pretty big number. So we've kept that out, and we think that that's an appropriate assumption. 
Now as we look to the non-COVID demand, which has consistently been in the low double digits here with the one or the other quarter perhaps even above, we feel very confident that the number of projects in the pipeline, we talked about it, over 1,500 monoclonal antibodies in the development pipeline, over 50% more than just 5 years ago. And then you add related to that, the gene and cell therapies and genomic medicines where you have over 1,000 projects in the pipeline, which is an order of magnitude more than just 5 years ago, we feel quite strongly that the capacity utilization will remain very robust here for the mid- and long term.

I think that in general, there is a strong supply of filters, as you mentioned, perhaps single-use products and such in the market and that there might be pockets where there are some shortages. But I think I would prescribe those to individual-type product shortages as opposed to a broad-based shortage as the industry and particularly Danaher has continued to ramp capacity with some of the investments that we made. So I think that what the industry has been able to do is accompany the growth here and continue to support that. 
Now as it relate to your inventory question, here, we have been very, very rigorous in our interactions with our customers who we asked and encouraged to give us their orders as early as possible to give us the visibility that we need to ensure that they get what they need. And as such, we don't believe that there's pockets of inventory that are sitting here in the industry. You can never ignore that there might be 1 or 2 places that perhaps that might be the case, but it's really not material in the overall size of the industry. So we think that the industry is tight on supply. Everybody is working through it with each other, we, with our customers with a great deal of visibility, but of course, also with our suppliers, who we mentioned earlier, who have also had to ramp up to support us in the value chain."

And as I look forward and think about the expenses coming back, and it's not just COVID, I would say it's kind of broadly speaking across the business, we think it's going to start to ramp here in the second half and be in the sort of 40% fall-through. And Dan, if you think about where we've been more historically, it's probably been more like 35%. And so I think what we'll see is that the expenses -- and here again, the uncertainty and the timing is what I'm still not sure on. But I think what we'll see is that, that expense will come back a little bit more closer to that normal longer-term 35%. And part of that is not only are we -- we're sort of seeing the benefit, I think, of the investment that we continue to make and we have been making in innovation and kind of go-to-market. And I think with that, if you think about today, our base business on a 2-year stack for this year is going to be 6% to 7% core growth, which is 100 basis points plus where we were in 2019. And so I think the investments that we're making are paying off on the growth side. And I think both Rainer and myself are inclined to want to try to keep making those investments while recognizing that we're going to have some costs that come back as get back to the office and we start to travel again. So maybe, Dan, the way to bridge it would be 50% today. I think it probably is a little bit more like 40% in the second half.

We're very pleased with our strong start to the year with another terrific result in the second quarter. We saw broad-based strength across the portfolio, which helped us deliver over 30% core revenue growth more than 70% adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding free cash flow generation. This well-rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day.  
During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through significant high-impact organic growth investments and enhanced our portfolio with strategic growth-accelerating acquisitions. We prioritized innovation across Danaher and increased our production capabilities, all of which we believe contributed to the market share gains in several of our businesses.  
We also announced our pending acquisition of Aldevron, which will expand our presence into the fast-growing and important frontier of genomic medicine. Putting it all together, we believe the combination of our leading portfolio and DBS-driven execution differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term outperformance.  
So with that, let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion, and we delivered core revenue growth of 31.5% with strong contributions from all 3 of our reporting segments. Geographically, high-growth markets grew nearly 35% and developed markets were up more than 25%. Revenue in each of our 3 largest markets, North America, Western Europe and China, was up 30% or more in the quarter. Our gross profit margin increased by 710 basis points to 60.9%, primarily due to higher sales volumes, the favorable impact of higher-margin product mix and the impact of prior year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. Our operating profit margin increased to 27.8%, including 775 basis points of core operating margin expansion, primarily as a result of higher gross margin and continued lower operating expense as travel and other related costs remain below pre-pandemic levels.  
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.46 were up 71% compared to 2020. We generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up over 40% year-over-year.  
In June, we announced our intention to acquire Aldevron, a producer of high-quality plasma DNA, mRNA and protein serving academic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers. The addition of Aldevron will expand our capabilities into the important field of genomic medicine where we're seeing the accelerated adoption of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and gene editing technologies. We anticipate Aldevron will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels as we expect the business to generate $500 million of revenue in 2022 with more than 20% annual revenue growth and a strong margin profile. We look forward to welcoming this incredibly talented and innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes.  
In addition to announcing the Aldevron acquisition, we also accelerated several organic growth investments across the portfolio. One of our core values at Danaher is innovation defines our future. And we have made a significant commitment toward our research and development efforts, increasing our research and development spend by more than 30% year-over-year to bring more impactful solutions to our customers.  
At SCIEX, we launched the ZenoTOF 7600, a high-resolution, accurate mass spectrometry system that enables scientists to identify, characterize and quantify molecules at previously undetectable levels, helping to advance the development of new biotherapeutics and precision diagnostics.  
At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, we recently introduced the DxA 5000 Fit, a compact automation solution designed for small and mid-sized laboratories that reduces up to 80% of the manual steps typically required for sample preparation. These are just a few great examples of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher to support our customers and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation.  
Additionally, we're making substantial investments to expand capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and Cepheid. Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand, driven by both the market and meaningful share gain, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see tremendous runway ahead given the underlying structural growth drivers in the markets they serve. We expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' needs today and well into the future. We believe the strategic combination of these organic and inorganic investments across our portfolio will reinforce our competitive advantage and accelerate our growth trajectory going forward.  
Now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life Sciences' reported revenue increased 41.5% with core revenue up 35%. This growth was broad-based with most of our major businesses in the platform delivering 30% or better core growth. We continue to see strong demand for our bioprocessing solutions with combined core revenue growth of more than 40% at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our non-COVID-related bioprocessing business was up low double digits where we saw robust customer activity and order rates. COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenues were consistent with the first quarter and exceeded $1 billion over the first 6 months of the year.  
So I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to reflect on Cytiva's fantastic first year as part of Danaher. We've established a new company with a new brand name, added more than 1,500 associates and made substantial progress in the transition to Danaher, all while maintaining world-class support of our customers, significantly ramping production capacity and growing revenue by more than 50%. When we announced the acquisition, we talked about the strategic and value-creation opportunities we saw and we're excited to welcome such a talented and engaged team to Danaher. I think it's fair to say they've exceeded our expectations in every way. And that's really a testament to the Cytiva team who've embraced Danaher and the Danaher Business System and continued to execute exceptionally in support of our customers.  
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 40.5% and core revenue grew 37%, led by more than 50% core growth at Cepheid. Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems each grew more than 30% as patient volumes and clinical diagnostic activity approached prepandemic levels around the world. At Cepheid, growth outside of respiratory testing was led by our sexual health and hospital-acquired infection assays, particularly among newly acquired Cepheid customers. In respiratory testing, we believe we continue to gain market share as expanded manufacturing capacity enable the team to produce and ship approximately 14 million cartridges in the quarter. 
As expected, COVID-only tests accounted for approximately 80% of these shipments, while our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 20%. This broad-based performance across Cepheid was driven by the team's thoughtful install base expansion over the last 15 months and is evidence of the significant value Cepheid provides to clinicians with the unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class, easy-to-use workflow at the point-of-care.  
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 15.5% and core revenue was up 13%. Revenue growth accelerated across both platforms, with Water Quality up high single digits and Product Identification up approximately 20% in the quarter. 
In our Water Quality businesses, demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by improving activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end markets. Equipment order rates accelerated as customers got back up and running and began to invest in larger projects. 
In Product Identification, Videojet was up mid-teens, and our packaging and color management businesses were up more than 25% in the quarter. This acceleration reflected a broad-based recovery with growth across most major geographies and end markets.  
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through trends geographically and across our end markets. Looking at conditions around the world, most major regions and countries have broadly returned to or are approaching normal operations. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the U.S., Europe and China. That said, we're mindful of the emerging COVID-19 variants driving further outbreaks and have taken actions to help minimize the potential impact on our respective businesses. And at this point, we've seen no material impact from recent variants or selective lockdown.  
We saw positive momentum across our businesses with order growth trending above revenue growth. Most of our end markets have largely recovered with growth rates at or above pre-pandemic levels as customers have adopted to the new environment. In-person commercial activity continues to rebound, and we're seeing our teams spend more time on site with their customers, a trend we expect to continue as we move through the year. 
Across Life Sciences, we're seeing healthy demand in most of our end markets, led by Biopharma where the pace of customer activity remains elevated. Biotech funding levels are robust, and the number of life-saving biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise and is further augmented by the work around COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is more than 50% increase from just 5 years ago. We also see over 1,000 gene therapy candidates in development today, a tenfold increase over the last several years as these technologies mature and therapies gain regulatory approval. Given that many of these candidates are still in early-stage research, we expect the growth rate of this market to remain strong for many years to come.  
In addition to the growth in biologic- and genomic-based medicines, there is significant demand related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, both on the market and in development today. Given the interest we're seeing from customers looking to address emerging variants and increased global supply as well as evolving vaccination guidelines globally, we expect to see durable growth in this segment of the biopharma market for the foreseeable future.  
At the current pace of vaccination, it's clear that vaccine demand will continue well into next year. We expect to recognize $2 billion in COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021 and anticipate entering 2022 with approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-related backlog. These assumptions do not include the potential contribution from booster shot or an expansion of availability to populations under 12-year old due to the level of uncertainty around each of these scenarios. Given the growing numbers of drug being developed and the increasing scientific sophistication required to discover and manufacture these complex therapies, customers are looking to partner with vendors who can reliably supply them with solutions for their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale. Our comprehensive bioprocessing portfolio and scientific expertise positions us well to do just that. And we're confident our proactive investments in innovation and capacity will help us meet this growing customer demand now and far into the future.  
In the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes are at or near pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. In molecular diagnostics, while PCR respiratory testing volumes in the U.S. have declined, we're seeing persistent demand for Cepheid's testing at the point-of-care. Outside of the U.S., which makes up approximately half of Cepheid's revenue, we continue to see strong demand for our testing as vaccination rates lag and emerging variants drive outbreaks.  
Now as I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 14 million respiratory tests during the second quarter, up from 10 million shipped in the first quarter, and we now expect to ship approximately 50 million tests in 2021. Looking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. And given Cepheid's leading positioning around speed, accuracy and the ease-of-use workflow advantages, we believe we'll continue to gain market share. The combination of these market share gains, the expansion of Cepheid's leading global install base and the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market creates significant opportunities ahead for broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing solutions.  
Moving to the applied market. We're seeing a continuation of the steady improvement over the first half of the year. Customer activity is accelerating in line with broader economic activity, which we see in healthy order rates for consumables and increasing investments in equipment. Across municipal markets globally, consumable demand remains solid as customers continue to test and treat water, and instrument-oriented project activity is accelerating with the improving funding environment.  
Now let's look ahead to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver third quarter core revenue growth in the mid- to high-teens range. We anticipate high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwinds. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of approximately 40% in the third quarter and for the remainder of 2021. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver approximately 20% core revenue growth. We anticipate that COVID-related revenue tailwinds will be an approximately 10% contribution to the core revenue growth rate. And in our base business, we now expect that core revenue will be up to 10% for the full year, an increase from our prior expectation of high single digits.  
So to wrap up, we've had a great start to the year, and we see meaningful opportunities across Danaher to build upon this outstanding performance. Our second quarter results reiterate the power of our portfolio and our exceptional team, a unique combination that differentiates Danaher today and provides a strong foundation for sustainable, long-term outperformance.  
And with that, back to you, Matt."

Rainer, I think one of the debates around the stock is still around the testing outlook in particular around 2022 for Cepheid. I know you came out of the first quarter and talked about the fact you thought trends would be sustainable heading into next year. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the field? How you're thinking about variance in the near term? And what gives you confidence in the outlook for 2022? Obviously, you're more in hospital. It's PCR, not antigens, so we get all those dynamics. But I think there's still some debate as to whether testing could drop off more significantly next year."

Look, as we think about the remainder of 2021 and how that sets us up for 2022, just a couple of things to sort of set the baseline here. First of all, we now expect to ship 50 million tests in 2021 for COVID,",359,"Sure, Tycho, and thank you for that question. Look, as we think about the remainder of 2021 and how that sets us up for 2022, just a couple of things to sort of set the baseline here. First of all, we now expect to ship 50 million tests in 2021 for COVID, either COVID only or 4-in-1. And that, we've taken that up from the 45 million test guide before.  
And the confidence that we gain here is really through what we've seen. As we've ramped up our capacity here and shipped 14 million cartridges in Q2, recall, we originally expected to ship 11 million in Q2, 50% of that outside of the U.S., 50% of that inside the U.S. That really has given us the confidence that there's still plenty of demand for our solution at the point-of-care. And here's why, we're really not perceiving a slowdown currently in our testing demand, and we're shipping everything that we're producing. So while it's true that we see lab -- core lab tests, trending downward, we continue to see strength in the demand for our testing solution.  
The other thing that we are considering here is we're a bit concerned about some of the RSV breakouts that we're seeing in the U.S., but also elsewhere in the world, which makes us think that we'll start seeing testing skew more towards the 4-in-1 solution, which, of course, tests for RSV in addition to Flu A, B and COVID-19. So as we think about where we sit today, we feel comfortable that we'll see 50 million tests this year. And we don't have anything that would indicate that our previous guide for 45 million tests in 2022 would be materially different. We continue to see plenty of opportunity. 
Keep in mind, we've increased our install base by 40% since the installation -- since beginning the of the pandemic and, of course, have the largest testing menu with 30-plus tests in outside the U.S. and 20-plus tests in the U.S. So we feel strongly that, that demand should be available to us once again because of that unique value proposition at the point-of-care."

There's plenty of opportunity inside that scope to invest, expand capacity in the existing product lineup as well as to globalize that. The great majority of Aldevron's revenues are actually in the U.S., so we see great opportunities to globalize that. 
And from a growth perspective, like we said, this is, in 2022, going to be a $0.5 billion business growing at 20%, adding about 50 basis points to Danaher's overall growth profile as well as adding $0.20 of EPS in year 1 and 30% -- $0.30 EPS in year 2."

All of that is just going to be sort of rolling that Q2 beat through to the full year for the COVID side. 
As far as the 4-in-1 goes, as we think about the contribution kind of going forward, we still think Q3 is probably going to be pretty close to what we saw here in Q2, which was 80% of that was COVID-only, 20% was the 4-in-1, given what Rainer said and what we saw last year as well. But what Rainer said around the RSV sort of outbreak here that we're seeing in the South, we think we might have a little bit of a different or more of a respiratory season than we did last year. So sort of as we move forward, we're sort of thinking Q4, that split moves more to a kind of a 50-50, 60-40, we'll see where it comes out, but something more like that in the fourth quarter."

We -- if we start with the topic of customer activity in these analytical markets, they're really at or very near pre-pandemic levels with the underlying recovery well underway. And we're seeing that customers adapting readily to a new work environment that we're in there where it's still necessary or are fully back to normal where the infection rates are really low. So that manifests itself in better order rates. Our funnels are stronger. We see higher instrument and service sales. Keep in mind, SCIEX over 30% core growth here in Q2, just as a marker, but really all of our major Life Science operating companies were at or over 30% core growth for the quarter. So we're seeing some very nice momentum there. 
And if you look at the 2-year growth stack there, we're really at or very near to pre-pandemic growth rate. A lot of this is driven by more customer activity. But we also have to say in our instrument areas is a place where we have been accelerating R&D investment, and we've seen great traction for some of our new product introductions. I mentioned the SCIEX ZenoTOF, but we've also introduced the 7500. And at Beckman Life Sciences, we introduced the CytoFLEX benchtop sales order.

I would say that the preponderance of the increase that you're seeing there is going to be at Cepheid and Cytiva as well as at Pall on the bioprocessing side. So those would be the 3 big ones that will be sort of driving that increase. 
I suspect you'll see that obviously this year. I suspect we might be something in between those 2 numbers, maybe we're at the higher end of that number, the $850 million and the $1.5 billion as we head into next year. But I think over time, that probably does start to come down a touch. As we've talked about, we've been pulling forward a lot of the capacity increases that we were already planning for all of those businesses just given the demand now plus the longer-term secular growth drivers. So this is sort of more of a pull-forward is the way I think about it. And I think you'll have a little bit of a bolus here for a couple of years and then probably come back down to a lower landing level."

Maybe one on vaccines and bioprocessing, Rainer. The commentary around backlog, exit backlog stepping up for the year in light of 2Q, it feels like maybe the order conversion, maybe that's stepping down in the back half. And is that the right way? This is just more of a timing thing that we're thinking about on the vaccine side when you think about the revenue cadence? And then ex vaccines, when you think about base bioprocessing, we just had a major Alzheimer's drug approval. I'm curious what it does to either industry growth or perhaps at your business."

So just to level set, we expect to do in, for vaccines and therapeutics, this year $2 billion in revenue. And that second half is going to be consistent with what you saw in the first half. And so the activity level remains elevated. And any detail that you're thinking about is purely related to comps. And now more broadly speaking really for total Danaher, the Q2, Q3 prior year step-up is over 1,000 basis points, right? 
So if you keep that in mind, I think that characterizes the activity level appropriately. We continue to see strength in vaccine and therapeutic. Orders, Matt just talked about it with Tycho, 40% plus on the revenue side in Q2, 60% plus on the order side. So the activity level remains very high. And we expect that this will continue, which is why we're confident in talking about $1.5 billion of backlog for 2022, which sitting here on July 20, looking forward, is a good place for us to be. And it gives us, as you think about 2022, a number of quarters to continue to strengthen that. 
So there's a great deal going on in the vaccine and therapeutic space. Keep in mind, the rollout that we've seen has been primarily a developed market story. We're starting now to see some of the emerging market vaccine manufacturers kicking in and ramping up. There's 3 in China to state an example, another one in Russia, of course, and several more. And they're just starting to kick in. So we expect that all to provide really some sustained strength for some period of time."

As you know, there's quite a bit of discussion around the efficacy of the drug, the size of the target population, reimbursement and a number of other questions. 
But I might say that this is one drug. There are several others that are in late-stage qualification and approval processes. And so we do see here this indication of Alzheimer's disease becoming more and more relevant for monoclonal antibodies. Awfully early to say what impact it has, but we can say that with the breadth of our portfolio, the capability of our team and the penetration that we have in the market, it's fair to say that we're represented on all of those projects and are confident that we can supply those should there be an elevated need."

So it's just really kind of balancing those 2. I think there's still enough uncertainty out there that it's difficult to pin that down.

But we are definitely seeing that. We are seeing it in resins, in plastics, in metals. Again, not a huge part for us, but we do see it where that happens. 
I think the 2 biggest pieces for us, Scott, our freight is definitely an issue. Fewer cargo flights, obviously, means it's a little bit more expensive to move things by air. And then I think as everybody has read and saw electronics, particularly in the supply chain around the chips globally, has been a challenge for us as well. 
So again, haven't seen a material impact.

So on Cepheid, there was an earlier question on the outlook for testing volume in 2022. As you've noted before, your GeneXpert install base increased by about 40% since the beginning of the pandemic. You've also previously talked about your efforts to be as smart as you can about where you place boxes. Essentially, the goal has been to as much as possible pull-forward placements, especially in areas of the world where you may have been under-indexed in an effort to make sure that these instruments are used durably over the long term. I was wondering if you could share some specific data on how you're having success with newer accounts driving utilization of these boxes for non-COVID-19 purposes. 
And additionally, is it possible that there are some new assays coming over the coming quarters that might move you into additional testing categories that also boost your confidence in the outlook for durability? I ask because right before the pandemic got going, we had picked up on some signs that there were some notable advancements being made on assay development initiatives, including some of those talked about in the past by old Cepheid management, which would greatly increase the TAM for the company. I think a lot of lingering concerns about this category would be further assuaged by combining what we saw in Q2, which was really strong with the outlook for assay menu expansion and some positive signs in terms of what's going on with newer accounts."

Once again, we've increased our install base here since the beginning of the pandemic by 40% plus. And that's put thousands of instruments in places where they haven't been before. And we've tried to do that very strategically, always, of course, wanting to help with the COVID pandemic and the near-term requirements and needs, but also looking beyond that to see whether those care settings would be able to use the menu that we have available today and the one that, of course, we develop every day in order to launch new assays. 
And we have seen that starting to play out in places where perhaps the COVID need is not as strong and particularly at new customers. And that's manifested, for instance, in our sexual health or our hospital-acquired infections assays, which are up 30% plus here in the second quarter and provide us with an additional pillar of strength. And so we're very pleased with that, and we expect that to continue here as we not only make progress in the U.S., but in the rest of the world. So a very important point. The menu is gaining traction, and we're starting to see that play out here in the second quarter and expect that to continue to be the case going forward.

You guys talked about it a few times. The expected backlog heading into '22 is $1.5 billion. The potential for upside, I think, seems pretty clear specific to COVID. That said, there is still some investor uncertainty with regards to what happens if demand were slow in this category. A basic but important question, if demand were to slow for COVID-related products and services in this category, is it fair to say that you're comfortable that there is enough demand more broadly across biopharma to essentially compensate for that? 
I mean our thinking has been, this has been an area where there just hasn't been enough good supply of products and services, and that's presented you with a fantastic opportunity to basically solve that problem. Even if the COVID demand were to slow, presumably, you're still going to be able to essentially reallocate these products and services for other purposes.

And before we move on to the non-COVID strength out there, let's reiterate in relation to that backlog number that we talked about, what assumptions are in that and which assumptions are not in that number. So in that $1.5 billion backlog that's in addition to the $2 billion that we're shipping this year, that includes all the approved vaccines, whether those are approved in the U.S. and Europe or elsewhere as well as those in late-stage trials, which you can imagine we're very close to. So that's absolutely a part of how we're thinking about that. And it includes these emerging market vaccines that I was talking about. 
But what it doesn't include is a booster shot. And we know from Israel, we know from the U.K., we know from China that those countries are now moving to a booster shot. But we have not assumed that to be a part of our numbers here. Nor have we included the younger kids 12 and under in a vaccination schedule, which you can imagine on a worldwide basis is a pretty big number. So we've kept that out, and we think that that's an appropriate assumption. 
Now as we look to the non-COVID demand, which has consistently been in the low double digits here with the one or the other quarter perhaps even above, we feel very confident that the number of projects in the pipeline, we talked about it, over 1,500 monoclonal antibodies in the development pipeline, over 50% more than just 5 years ago. And then you add related to that, the gene and cell therapies and genomic medicines where you have over 1,000 projects in the pipeline, which is an order of magnitude more than just 5 years ago, we feel quite strongly that the capacity utilization will remain very robust here for the mid- and long term."

I think that in general, there is a strong supply of filters, as you mentioned, perhaps single-use products and such in the market and that there might be pockets where there are some shortages. But I think I would prescribe those to individual-type product shortages as opposed to a broad-based shortage as the industry and particularly Danaher has continued to ramp capacity with some of the investments that we made. So I think that what the industry has been able to do is accompany the growth here and continue to support that. 
Now as it relates to your inventory question, here, we have been very, very rigorous in our interactions with our customers who we've asked and encouraged to give us their orders as early as possible to give us the visibility that we need to ensure that they get what they need. And as such, we don't believe that there's pockets of inventory that are sitting here in the industry. You can never ignore that there might be 1 or 2 places that perhaps that might be the case, but it's really not material in the overall size of the industry. 
So we think that the industry is tight on supply. Everybody is working through it with each other. We, with our customers, with a great deal of visibility, but of course, also with our suppliers, who we mentioned earlier, who have also had to ramp up to support us in the value chain."

And as I look forward and think about the expenses coming back, and it's not just COVID, I would say it's kind of broadly speaking across the business, we think it's going to start to ramp here in the second half and be in the sort of 40% fall-through. And Dan, if you think about where we've been more historically, it's probably been more like 35%. 
And so I think what we'll see is that the expenses -- and here again, the uncertainty in the timing is what I'm still not sure on. But I think what we'll see is that, that expense base will come back a little bit more closer to that normal longer-term 35%. And part of that is not only are we -- we're sort of seeing the benefits, I think, of the investment that we continue to make and we have been making in innovation and kind of go-to-market. And I think with that, if you think about today, our base business on a 2-year stack. For this year, it's going to be 6% to 7% core growth, which is 100 basis points plus where we were in 2019. 
And so I think the investments that we're making are paying off on the growth side. And I think both Rainer and myself are inclined to want to try to keep making those investments while recognizing that we're going to have some costs that come back as we get back to the office and we start to travel again.

Our team delivered another outstanding result in the third quarter with over 20% core revenue growth, nearly 40% adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow generation. This well-rounded performance is a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Business System every day. 
I'd like to thank all of you who joined us last month for our virtual Investor Day, where we had the opportunity to showcase the strong foundation we've built for generating sustainable long-term outperformance. We highlighted our fantastic portfolio of market-leading franchises in highly attractive end markets, the exceptional team we have out on the field every day, and how we differentiate with the Danaher Business System. And we certainly saw this powerful combination in action during the third quarter as our results attest. 
Now we also talked about our sustainability efforts. And just last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report. This year's report reflects the measurable progress we've made across the 3 pillars of our sustainability program, which are innovation, people and the environment, and how we use the Danaher Business System to execute on this increasingly important strategic priority. 
Now I hope you all get a chance to read through the report and learn more about the important work that we're doing across Danaher to positively impact the world around us for generations to come. 
So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion, and we delivered 20.5% core revenue growth with portfolio-wide strength led by diagnostics and life sciences. Geographically, high-growth markets grew approximately 25% and developed markets were up nearly 20%. In fact, revenue in each of our 3 largest markets, North America, Western Europe and China was up approximately 20% or more in the quarter. 
Our gross profit margin increased by 550 basis points to 60.3%, primarily due to higher sales volume, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix, and the impact of prior year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. 
Now adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.39 and were up 39% compared to 2020, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter bringing our year-to-date total to $5.2 billion, which is up 46.5% year-over-year. 
We continue to accelerate organic growth investments across the entire portfolio and increased our research and development spend by approximately 30% year-over-year. 
At our Investor Day recently, we highlighted how we use DBS growth tools and processes to accelerate innovation and bring more impactful solutions to our customers faster. In fact, we recently launched products like the SCIEX Xenotop7600 and the Triple Quad 7500 and Beckman Life Sciences CytoflexSRT benchtop cells order are just a few great examples of how we're driving market share gains through proprietary innovation and enhancing our growth trajectory going forward. 
We're also making substantial investments to expand production capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and [ assets ]. Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand and driving meaningful share gains, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see significant runway ahead given the underlying structural growth drivers in the sectors they serve. And we expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' needs today and well into the future. 
So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life sciences reported revenue increased 24.5%, with core revenue up 20%. This growth was broad based across the segment with most major operating companies achieving high teens or better core growth. Now these strong results were led by continued demand for our bioprocessing solutions, as in Cytiva bioprocessing and Pall Biotech both grew more than 30% [ in the quarter ], including low double-digit non-COVID-related core growth. 
COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue contributed -- continued to be strong and now exceeds $1.5 billion year-to-date. 
At Cytiva, we passed an important milestone last month when we exited the last of our transition services agreement with GE. We successfully completed this process ahead of schedule, which is a testament to the entire Cytiva and integration team and their collective commitment to the Danaher Business System. Cytiva also added more than 1,500 new associates to the global team since joining Danaher to help ensure that we're supporting our customers today and continue meeting their needs well into the future. 
Now in August, we successfully closed our acquisition of Aldevron, and we are thrilled to officially welcome the team to Danaher. Aldevron is a leading producer of high-quality plasma DNA, mRNA and protein, and provides a fantastic beachhead for us in our genomic medicine enterprise. We're seeing the rapid development of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines, and gene editing technology. And Aldevron expands our capabilities in these areas to ultimately help our customers bring more life-saving therapies and vaccines to market faster. So we're really excited about the quality, the scale, the turnaround time and the reputation that Aldevron brings to the Danaher portfolio. 
In diagnostics, reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 28.5% led by more than 60% growth at Cepheid. Each of our other major diagnostic businesses, Beckman Coulter, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems grew low to mid-teens in the quarter as clinical diagnostic activity and patient volumes around the world largely returned to prepandemic levels. 
In respiratory testing at Cepheid, we further expanded manufacturing capacity, which enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 16 million cartridges during the quarter. COVID-only tests accounted for approximately 80% of those shipments, and our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19 to A and B and RSV represented approximately 20%. 
Nonrespiratory core growth at Cepheid was up double digits as well, led by demand for hospital-acquired infections, sexual health and urology testing. We also saw strong growth in our installed base as system placements continue to exceed pre-pandemic rates. And we believe the team's thoughtful placement of the GE expert and Infinity System over the last 18 months is setting up Cepheid very well for future growth opportunities. 
Let's move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 7%, with core revenue up 7.5%. Water quality grew mid-single digits, and Product Identification platform was up low double digits. 
Across our water quality businesses, we saw good underlying market strength, particularly in food and beverage and various industrial applications as activity return to more normal levels. Municipal projects picked up given the improving funding environment and as more customers return to in-personal work. 
On Product Identification, both Videojet and our packaging and color management businesses were up low double digits in the quarter. Comparable strength across consumables, service and installed base growth was driven by more normalized levels of customer activity and investment. We believe that our ability to meet our customers' needs, particularly on the equipment side at Videojet, enabled us to gain market share and expand our industry-leading installed base of printers. 
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through regional and end market trends. Most major regions and countries around the world are largely back to pre-pandemic activity levels. Customers have adapted to the current operating environment and protocols, and broadly resumed in-person commercial activities inside access. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the U.S., Europe and China. And this momentum is also reflected in our strong order book growth, which is trending above revenue growth. 
Now we're mindful of potential COVID-19 variants or outbreaks and selective lockdowns, but we're not currently seeing any material negative impact from these scenarios. And while we are seeing some global supply chain constraints, we're leveraging the Danaher Business System tools like daily management, and actively working with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate any impact. 
Across life sciences, we're seeing robust customer activity and demand across all major end markets. Lab and other site access is largely back to pre-COVID levels, and we're seeing this through more normalized productivity levels, installations and project initiations driven by a strong funding environment. 
Now biopharma continues to lead the way as the number of life-saving biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise and is augmented by the ongoing work around COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And at our recent Investor Day, we spent time covering how well positioned we are to support this complex, life-changing work that our customers are pursuing. 
Our combined bioprocessing portfolio across Cytiva and Pall Biotech is the broadest offering in the industry with leading positions in upstream and downstream applications. And we further support our customers with best-in-class scientific services, partnering to solve their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale. And our global reach enables us to reliably and consistently meet our customers' needs. 
Now in addition to the industry-wide opportunities in biologics and genomic-based medicines, we continue to see significant demand related to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our customers are working to address emerging variants and increased global supply. And given that only about 1/3 of the global population has been vaccinated, we believe we'll see durable growth in the biopharma segment for the foreseeable future. 
We continue to expect about $2 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021. And since we spoke at our Investor Day, we now expect to enter 2022 with approximately $2 billion in COVID-related backlog versus our previous expectation of $1.5 billion of backlog. This increase is driven by the recent enhanced visibility for booster shots and the likelihood of vaccine availability for children under 12 years old in the U.S. 
Now moving to the clinical diagnostic market. non-COVID testing volumes are essentially back to pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. 
In molecular diagnostics, strong global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory testing as a result of the Delta variant and outbreaks, along with lower vaccination rates in many regions. And as I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 16 million respiratory tests during the third quarter and we now expect to ship approximately 55 million tests in 2021 versus our prior expectation of 50 million. 
Now as we head into the traditional respiratory virus season, we're hearing from customers that they expect this to be a much more active season than last year's. In preparation, their preferences for our 4-in-1 combination test. So we're seeing an uptick in demand for those cartridges, particularly given the recent outbreak of RSV across the U.S. 
Cepheid's 4-in-1 test was also recently approved with a third gene target for SARS CoV-2 detection, ensuring it can continue to accurately detect future COVID-19 viral mutation and reinforcing Cepheid's competitive advantage in the respiratory testing market. 
Now moving to the applied market. Customer activity has largely rebounded to prepandemic levels, which we see in robust order [ wave ] of both consumables and equipment. In the global municipal market, consumables demand remains solid and the pace of instrument-oriented project activity continues to pick up with the improving funding environment and broad return to work. 
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver fourth quarter core revenue growth in the low to mid-teens range, with high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a mid- to high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall through of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter, a similar level to what we achieved in the third quarter. 
Now for the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver more than 20% core tailwind, and our base business will each contribute more than 10% to our 2021 core revenue growth rate. 
So to wrap up, we're proud to deliver another terrific result here in the third quarter. Our performance is a testament to the power of our unique portfolio, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. And this unique combination differentiates Danaher today, and it reinforces our opportunities ahead for sustainable, long-term outperformance. 
So with that, back over to you, Matt."

So let me start with, we are not seeing any material impact related to -- from the tenders or some of the other things that we hear out of China. In fact, the [ Hanway Province ] tender is really an exception in diagnostics and actually more common in other industries. And we'll see this kind of thing from time to time, but it's neither unexpected nor do we see it as material. 
But what we're seeing generally in China is really very consistent with what we've seen over the past several years. China has been very forthcoming with its Made in China 2025 initiative as well as several others, all of which we see quite aligned with our strategy, starting with our portfolio, which is clearly aligned with the Healthy China 2030 agenda where you see the need for both improved diagnostic solutions as well as life science, research and bioprocessing, as well as a desire to protect the environment where water quality really plays big as well as the desire to improve and protect the food supply, where we see PID playing large as well. So we think we're really ideally positioned here to meet the needs of where China is going. 
Now at the same time, for years, we have been investing in China as our business gains scale to ultimately localize our production. And that's been the case here for some time, positioning us very well in China. And that will continue to be the case going forward as our businesses continue to gain scale there."

Just to name a couple, of course, electronic components, freight and logistics and some labor shortages. But really, this is where the Danaher Business System is a differentiator for us in this environment. 
In fact, despite the additional work that ensues, we see this really as an opportunity for ourselves to differentiate with our DBS tool set, for instance, with daily management, which brings our cross-functional teams together on a daily basis, drive disciplined execution and accountability, as well as the sense of urgency and real-time problem solving. And at the same time, of course, we're qualifying additional suppliers and building safety stocks. So this is how we make sure that Danaher continues to not only meet its customer expectations but also has opportunity to gain share. 
Now at the same time, of course, we see some inflationary pressures, and we're off to those of course, with a more active cadence of price increases and those will also be incrementally larger than in the past as well as freight and fuel surcharges. So on the one hand, we're driving, as always, to reduce our cost of goods sold. At the same time, we take additional offsets with moving on some of these surcharges and price increases I mentioned. 
I think also importantly to note here is that this is not a top-down process. The Danaher operating companies have this process muscle and are able to execute effectively, whether that's ensuring the security of the supply chain or whether that's ensuring that we can offset cost increases via price and other methods. And ultimately, we think that differentiates us, and we think we're gaining share as a result of that in PID, water quality, Cytiva and Pall, Radiometer and elsewhere."

So Derik, as you know, we have been, and as you just mentioned, investing very significantly in the business. This is not only the case in capital expenditures where we're investing in our manufacturing network throughout the world, but we've also been investing significantly in research and development, in feet on the street to drive proprietary innovation in the short and long term, as well as to ensure that we can continue to drive share gains with our direct business model. 
And as we think about the operating leverage, you know that our fall-through here has been in the 40% range. And we think that's a good way to think about the quarter here as well. 
In the long term, historically, our fall-through has been more than 35% range. And we think that's probably the better way to think about fall-through for the long term just because we want to find that balance of reinvesting in the business as well as driving profitability expansion. 
And we think that flywheel works for us, right? Mid-single-digit plus growth on the one hand. On the other hand, 50 to 75 basis points of operating margin expansion, free cash flow conversion, over net income over 100%, all of that then to drive double-digit plus EPS growth. And when you couple that with our current balance sheet positioning, with our bias to deploy capital towards M&A, we think that sets us up very nicely here, both from an operating leverage perspective as well as driving our growth franchise forward."

Now coming back to your capacity question. As you likely are aware, and as we talked about also in our Analyst Day, we have been investing in capacity expansions in the biotech business now for some time. In fact, we ensured that the investment continued even prior to the closing of the acquisition from GE. And we have continued with those investments that have come online here nearly in a continuous fashion through the second half of 2020 and 2021.

But when we look at like the base growth ex-COVID, and we consider like a stack, and this is clearly very imprecise but in Q3, that base growth on a 2-year average basis was around 4, maybe a little bit below that. And I believe in Q4, the high single-digit base guidance implies like a 2-year stack that might be closer to 3. And this is compared against what we consider Danaher's underlying growth rate, probably somewhere in the 6% to 8% range when things get back to normal. So I'm just trying to reconcile some of the underlying stack? And is it just conservatism right now? Are things back to normal? Or maybe is it to imprecise to do this analysis with COVID?"

We do see more work occurring at the workplace and with that, more projects being tackled both in the capital as well as operating investment categories. And we would expect that to continue to improve here going forward as the economy continues to pick up speed and return to normality. 
As we think about life sciences, research funding is up, whether that's government funding, whether that's venture capital funding, or whether that is biopharma funding from the pharmaceutical company. We see -- seen a step up here in an effort to take advantage of the opportunities that new breakthroughs and technologies that you're all aware of as a result of COVID, all creating a great deal more awareness of the possibilities here in therapeutics. 
So we see, generally speaking, a great environment in the life science area. Bioprocess, we talked about with continued capacity increases to meet the need of the very fast-growing therapeutic pipeline. We talked about the fact that monoclonal antibody pipeline is up 50% in terms of the number of projects over the last 5 years. Genomic gene cell therapy pipeline is up an order of magnitude, so 10x versus 5 years ago. So that's creating very healthy drive here, whether that's in the research side of life sciences or in the bioprocessing. 
And then when you come back to diagnostics, patient volumes are nearly at full rate -- pre-pandemic rate, if you will, in nearly every geography. And we continue to, of course, see COVID driving additional diagnostic demand. And so across the board, a very positive funding environment. And we would expect that the one or the other budget is going to be taking advantage of here in the fourth quarter. We'll see.

I talked about that earlier in the call, driving that mid-single-digit plus growth, double-digit EPS expansion and of course, then having a very strong balance sheet position in order to continue to prioritize capital allocation towards M&A. 
As we think about our balance sheet position this year after the Aldevron deal, by the end of the year, we should probably be back to about 2x net debt -- 2 turns of EBITDA over net debt. And we think that puts us in great position. And our funnels are active, and we continue to work as we always have at Danaher to ensure that we have the next deal ahead of us and take advantage of the balance sheet that we have.

Our team delivered another outstanding result in the third quarter with over 20% core revenue growth, nearly 40% adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow generation. This well-rounded performance is a testament to the unique positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team who are committed to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System every day. 
I'd like to thank all of you who joined us last month for our virtual Investor Day, where we had the opportunity to showcase the strong foundation we've built for generating sustainable long-term outperformance. We highlighted our fantastic portfolio of market-leading franchises in highly attractive end markets, the exceptional team we have out on the field every day, and how we differentiate with the Danaher Business System. And we certainly saw this powerful combination in action during the third quarter as our results attest. 
Now we also talked about our sustainability efforts. And just last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report. This year's report reflects the measurable progress we've made across the 3 pillars of our sustainability program, which are innovation, people and the environment, and how we use the Danaher Business System to execute on this increasingly important strategic priority. 
Now I hope you all get a chance to read through the report and learn more about the important work that we're doing across Danaher to positively impact the world around us for generations to come. 
So with that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Our sales were $7.2 billion, and we delivered 20.5% core revenue growth with portfolio-wide strength led by diagnostics and life sciences. Geographically, high-growth markets grew approximately 25%, and developed markets were up nearly 20%. In fact, revenue in each of our 3 largest markets, North America, Western Europe and China was up approximately 20% or more in the quarter. 
Our gross profit margin increased by 550 basis points to 60.3%, primarily due to higher sales volume, the favorable impact of higher margin product mix, and the impact of prior year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition that did not repeat in 2021. 
Now adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.39 and were up 39% compared to 2020, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter bringing our year-to-date total to $5.2 billion, which is up 46.5% year-over-year. 
We continue to accelerate organic growth investments across the entire portfolio and increased our research and development spend by approximately 30% year-over-year. 
At our Investor Day recently, we highlighted how we use DBS growth tools and processes to accelerate innovation and bring more impactful solutions to our customers faster. In fact, recently launched products like the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 and the Triple Quad 7500 and Beckman Life Sciences CytoFLEX SRT Benchtop Cell Sorter are just a few great examples of how we're driving market share gains through proprietary innovation and enhancing our growth trajectory going forward. 
We're also making substantial investments to expand production capacity across our bioprocessing businesses and Cepheid. Near term, these investments are supporting existing customer demand and driving meaningful share gains, but they're equally important to support the long-term growth of these businesses where we see significant runway ahead given the underlying structural growth drivers in the sectors they serve. And we expect our total capital expenditures across Danaher to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in support of our customers' needs today and well into the future. 
So now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life sciences reported revenue increased 24.5%, with core revenue up 20%. This growth was broad based across the segment with most major operating companies achieving high teens or better core growth. Now these strong results were led by continued demand for our bioprocessing solutions, as in Cytiva bioprocessing and Pall Biotech both grew more than 30% in the quarter, including low double-digit non-COVID-related core growth. 
COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue contributed -- continued to be strong and now exceeds $1.5 billion year-to-date. 
At Cytiva, we passed an important milestone last month when we exited the last of our transition services agreement with GE. We successfully completed this process ahead of schedule, which is a testament to the entire Cytiva and integration team and their collective commitment to the Danaher Business System. Cytiva also added more than 1,500 new associates to the global team since joining Danaher to help ensure that we're supporting our customers today and continue meeting their needs well into the future. 
Now in August, we successfully closed our acquisition of Aldevron, and we are thrilled to officially welcome the team to Danaher. Aldevron is a leading producer of high-quality plasma DNA, mRNA and protein, and provides a fantastic beachhead for us in our genomic medicine enterprise. We're seeing the rapid development of gene and cell therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines, and gene editing technology. And Aldevron expands our capabilities in these areas to ultimately help our customers bring more life-saving therapies and vaccines to market faster. So we're really excited about the quality, the scale, the turnaround time and the reputation that Aldevron brings to the Danaher portfolio. 
In diagnostics, reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 28.5% led by more than 60% growth at Cepheid. Each of our other major diagnostic businesses, Beckman Coulter, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems grew low to mid-teens in the quarter as clinical diagnostic activity and patient volumes around the world largely returned to prepandemic levels. 
In respiratory testing at Cepheid, we further expanded manufacturing capacity, which enabled the team to produce and ship approximately 16 million cartridges during the quarter. COVID-only tests accounted for approximately 80% of those shipments, and our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19 to A and B and RSV represented approximately 20%. 
Nonrespiratory core growth at Cepheid was up double digits as well, led by demand for hospital-acquired infections, sexual health and urology testing. We also saw strong growth in our installed base as system placements continue to exceed pre-pandemic rates. And we believe the team's thoughtful placement of the GeneXpert and Infinity Systems over the last 18 months is setting up Cepheid very well for future growth opportunities. 
Let's move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 7%, with core revenue up 7.5%. Water quality grew mid-single digits, and our Product Identification platform was up low double digits. 
Across our water quality businesses, we saw good underlying market strength, particularly in food and beverage and various industrial applications as activity returned to more normal levels. Municipal projects picked up given the improving funding environment and as more customers returned to in-person work. 
On Product Identification, both Videojet and our packaging and color management businesses were up low double digits in the quarter. Comparable strength across consumables, service and installed base growth was driven by more normalized levels of customer activity and investment. We believe that our ability to meet our customers' needs, particularly on the equipment side at Videojet, enabled us to gain market share and expand our industry-leading installed base of printers. 
So with that as a backdrop for what we saw this quarter, let's spend some time going through regional and end market trends. Most major regions and countries around the world are largely back to pre-pandemic activity levels. Customers have adapted to the current operating environment and protocols, and broadly resumed in-person commercial activities and site access. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen across the U.S., Europe and China. And this momentum is also reflected in our strong order book growth, which is trending above revenue growth. 
Now we're mindful of potential COVID-19 variants or outbreaks and selective lockdowns, but we're not currently seeing any material negative impact from these scenarios. And while we are seeing some global supply chain constraints, we're leveraging the Danaher Business System tools like daily management, and actively working with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate any impact. 
Across life sciences, we're seeing robust customer activity and demand across all major end markets. Lab and other site access is largely back to pre-COVID levels, and we're seeing this through more normalized productivity levels, installations and project initiations driven by a strong funding environment. 
Now biopharma continues to lead the way as the number of life-saving biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise and is augmented by the ongoing work around COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. And at our recent Investor Day, we spent time covering how well positioned we are to support this complex, life-changing work that our customers are pursuing. 
Our combined bioprocessing portfolio across Cytiva and Pall Biotech is the broadest offering in the industry with leading positions in upstream and downstream applications. And we further support our customers with best-in-class scientific services, partnering to solve their most challenging problems as they move from the lab to production scale. And our global reach enables us to reliably and consistently meet our customers' needs. 
Now in addition to the industry-wide opportunities in biologics and genomic-based medicines, we continue to see significant demand related to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our customers are working to address emerging variants and increased global supply. And given that only about 1/3 of the global population has been vaccinated, we believe we'll see durable growth in this biopharma segment for the foreseeable future. 
We continue to expect about $2 billion of COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue in 2021. And since we spoke at our Investor Day, we now expect to enter 2022 with approximately $2 billion in COVID-related backlog versus our previous expectation of $1.5 billion of backlog. This increase is driven by the recent enhanced visibility for booster shots and the likelihood of vaccine availability for children under 12 years old in the U.S. 
Now moving to the clinical diagnostic market. Non-COVID testing volumes are essentially back to pre-pandemic levels in most major regions as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. 
In molecular diagnostics, strong global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory testing as a result of the Delta variant and outbreaks, along with lower vaccination rates in many regions. And as I mentioned earlier, we shipped approximately 16 million respiratory tests during the third quarter and we now expect to ship approximately 55 million tests in 2021 versus our prior expectation of 50 million. 
Now as we head into the traditional respiratory virus season, we're hearing from customers that they expect this to be a much more active season than last year's. In preparation, their preference is for our 4-in-1 combination test. So we're seeing an uptick in demand for those cartridges, particularly given the recent outbreak of RSV across the U.S. 
Cepheid's 4-in-1 test was also recently approved with a third gene target for SARS CoV-2 detection, ensuring it can continue to accurately detect future COVID-19 viral mutation and reinforcing Cepheid's competitive advantage in the respiratory testing market. 
Now moving to the applied market. Customer activity has largely rebounded to prepandemic levels, which we see in robust order rates across both consumables and equipment. In the global municipal market, consumables demand remains solid and the pace of instrument-oriented project activity continues to pick up with the improving funding environment and broad return to work. 
So now let's look ahead to our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect to deliver fourth quarter core revenue growth in the low to mid-teens range, with high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and a mid- to high single-digit core growth contribution from COVID-related revenue tailwind. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall through of approximately 40% in the fourth quarter, a similar level to what we achieved in the third quarter. 
Now for the full year 2021, we now expect to deliver more than 20% core tailwind, and our base business will each contribute more than 10% to our 2021 core revenue growth rate. 
So to wrap up, we're proud to deliver another terrific result here in the third quarter. Our performance is a testament to the power of our unique portfolio, the strength of our end markets and our team's commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. And this unique combination differentiates Danaher today, and it reinforces our opportunities ahead for sustainable, long-term outperformance. 
So with that, back over to you, Matt."

So let me start with, we are not seeing any material impact related to some of the tenders or some of the other things that we hear out of China. In fact, the [indiscernible] Province tender is really an exception in diagnostics and actually more common in other industries. And we'll see this kind of thing from time to time, but it's neither unexpected nor do we see it as material. 
But what we're seeing generally in China is really very consistent with what we've seen over the past several years. China has been very forthcoming with its Made in China 2025 initiative as well as several others, all of which we see quite aligned with our strategy, starting with our portfolio, which is clearly aligned with the Healthy China 2030 agenda where you see the need for both improved diagnostic solutions as well as life science, research and bioprocessing, as well as the desire to protect the environment where water quality really plays big as well as the desire to improve and protect the food supply, where we see PID playing large as well. So we think we're really ideally positioned here to meet the needs of where China is going. 
Now at the same time, for years, we have been investing in China as our business gains scale to ultimately localize our production. And that's been the case here for some time, positioning us very well in China. And that will continue to be the case going forward as our businesses continue to gain scale there."

Just to name a couple, of course, electronic components, freight and logistics and some labor shortages. But really, this is where the Danaher Business System is a differentiator for us in this environment. 
In fact, despite the additional work that ensues, we see this really as an opportunity for ourselves to differentiate with our DBS tool set, for instance, with daily management, which brings our cross-functional teams together on a daily basis, drive disciplined execution and accountability, as well as the sense of urgency and real-time problem solving. And at the same time, of course, we're qualifying additional suppliers and building safety stocks. So this is how we make sure that Danaher continues to not only meet its customer expectations but also has opportunity to gain share. 
Now at the same time, of course, we see some inflationary pressures, and we're offsetting those of course, with a more active cadence of price increases, and those will also be incrementally larger than in the past as well as freight and fuel surcharges. So on the one hand, we're driving, as always, to reduce our cost of goods sold. At the same time, we take additional offsets with moving on some of these surcharges and price increases I mentioned. 
I think also importantly to note here is that this is not a top-down process. The Danaher operating companies have this process muscle and are able to execute effectively, whether that's ensuring the security of the supply chain or whether that's ensuring that we can offset cost increases via price and other methods. And ultimately, we think that differentiates us, and we think we're gaining share as a result of that in PID, Water Quality, Cytiva and Pall, Radiometer and elsewhere."

So we really see ourselves in an advantaged position here and believe that we continue to take share, whether that's on a quarterly or on an annual basis. That's, for sure, the case. 
Now as we think about the long-term growth, and perhaps our time lines need to be aligned here as we think of long-term growth, we -- you might recall when we acquired Cytiva, we thought this was more of a 6% type of growth business. And what we've seen here is that certainly, the growth of this business has rerated higher and certainly in the pandemic, is quite a bit higher. 
So once again, as we think about the long term, we think it's prudent to think about a business at that scale in the high single digits. And we think that will compare very favorably with any other business out there in the short, medium and long term."

And as we think about the operating leverage, you know that our fall-through here has been in the 40% range. And we think that's a good way to think about the quarter here as well. 
In the long term, historically, our fall-through has been more than 35% range. And we think that's probably the better way to think about fall-through for the long term just because we want to find that balance of reinvesting in the business as well as driving profitability expansion. 
And we think that flywheel works for us, right? Mid-single-digit plus growth on the one hand. On the other hand, 50 to 75 basis points of operating margin expansion, free cash flow conversion, over -- net income over 100%, all of that then to drive double-digit plus EPS growth.

Now coming back to your capacity question. As you likely are aware, and as we talked about also in our Analyst Day, we have been investing in capacity expansions in the biotech business now for some time. In fact, we ensured that the investment continued even prior to the closing of the acquisition from GE.

But when we look at like the base growth ex-COVID, and we consider like a stack, and this is clearly very imprecise, but in Q3, that base growth on a 2-year average basis was around 4, maybe a little bit below that. 
And I believe in Q4, the high single-digit base guidance implies like a 2-year stack that might be closer to 3. And this is compared against what we consider Danaher's underlying growth rate, probably somewhere in the 6% to 8% range when things get back to normal.

As we think about life sciences, research funding is up, whether that's government funding, whether that's venture capital funding, or whether that is biopharma funding from the pharmaceutical company. We've  see -- seen a step up here in an effort to take advantage of the opportunities that new breakthroughs and technologies that you're all aware of as a result of COVID, all creating a great deal more awareness of the possibilities here in therapeutics. 
So we see, generally speaking, a great environment in the life science area, bioprocess, we talked about with continued capacity increases to meet the need of the very fast-growing therapeutic pipeline. We talked about the fact that monoclonal antibody pipeline is up 50% in terms of the number of projects over the last 5 years. Genomic gene cell therapy pipeline is up in order of magnitude, so 10x versus 5 years ago. So that's creating very healthy drive here, whether that's in the research side of life sciences or in the bioprocessing. 
And then when you come back to diagnostics, patient volumes are nearly at full rate -- pre-pandemic rate, if you will, in nearly every geography. And we continue to, of course, see COVID driving additional diagnostic demand. And so across the board, a very positive funding environment. And we would expect that the one or the other budget is going to be taking advantage of here in the fourth quarter. We'll see.

There's plenty of opportunity, as you likely know, in the core businesses of Aldevron, and we see that. We see that in the order book, we see that in revenues, and we will see that also in their earnings contributions, all of which is running as we expected when we updated during the acquisition. 
So we expect to see $400 million of revenue. This year, growth rate in 20%-plus range, and we expect to see $0.20 of EPS in year 1, growing to $0.30 of EPS in year 2. So Aldevron, incredibly pleased with the motivation and the engagement of the team and the important work that they're doing, and proud to have him as a part of the Danaher family."

As we think about our balance sheet position this year after the Aldevron deal, by the end of the year, we should probably be back to about 2x net debt -- 2 turns of EBITDA over net debt. And we think that puts us in great position. And our funnels are active, and we continue to work as we always have at Danaher to ensure that we have the next deal ahead of us and take advantage of the balance sheet that we have.
