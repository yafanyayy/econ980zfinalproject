I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance as well as our expectations for 2021. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and Rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. 
We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Fourth quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. This performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hemant and neuroscience franchises as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of BOTOX Cosmetic, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery. 
Our fourth quarter performance tops off another excellent and truly transformational year for AbbVie, which included: the successful acquisition and integration of Allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse AbbVie; with leadership across numerous attractive, high-growth markets; significant contributions from our 2 new best-in-category immunology medicines, RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. We expect the combined contribution from RINVOQ and SKYRIZI to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion, based on their continued strong uptake in RA and psoriasis as well as wind boats anticipated approvals in PSA, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis later this year. 
We delivered continued robust growth from our leading hemon portfolio, with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. We expect our human franchise to grow double digits again in 2021. We also added 2 compelling oncology pipeline assets: upadacitinib, a potential best-in-class CD3 by CD20 bispecific antibody in development for B-cell malignancies; and lemzoparlimab I-mab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. These 2 assets will further support the growth of our human franchise across our long-range plan. 
The acquisition of Allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions, augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. The newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021. We also added the leading global aesthetics franchise, a largely cash paid portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. As I've previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid d shaped recovery, and we view aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. And importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. We expect our R&D pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next 2 years, including a total of 6 additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which will cover all of Humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis; expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and Vraylar and several new product approvals, including atogepant for episodic migraine, navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. These new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the U.S. Humira LOE. 
We've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4%, with total AbbVie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus. And we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. This level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021. 
The Allergan integration continues to go very well. The transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic. While we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which Rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous Allergan growth platforms. 
As we recently disclosed, we believe UBRELVY, the first to market and leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity; atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. We expect Baylor's peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression. With major depressive disorder, or MDD, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity. 
Aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year, is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. We continue to closely monitor the COVID dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year, but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. And despite the recent COVID resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global health care system is much better equipped with COVID treatment protocols and PPE to safely see treat patients throughout the current year. 
That said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like CLL, HCV, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance. Overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. So in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets, and the outlook for AbbVie's business remains strong, with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025, and our expectations for continued robust growth across Kimon, neuroscience and aesthetics. We have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the Humira LOE impact in 2023 supporting an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade. With the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"
141885706,700927148,2189808,"AbbVie Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","AbbVie Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rick.

Since inception, our R",2286,"Thank you, Rick. We've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA and in immunology with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Since inception, our R&D organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. We also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs, with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years. We will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for AbbVie in the second half of the decade. 
At our recent Immunology Investor event in December, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to date for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across approved and pipeline indications. Included in this event, we presented positive top line data from 2 new Phase III studies for RINVOQ, results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilimab and atopic dermatitis. We expect to see results from the second Phase III UC induction study later this quarter and from the UC maintenance study in the middle of this year. With regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. 
Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are currently under review, and we expect an approval decision in the U.S. in the second quarter based on priority review and in Europe in the second half of the year. We recently received European Commission approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the U.S. in the first half of this year. 
I want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically mace and malignancies, following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. At presence, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study apply to a specific JAK1 inhibitor such as RINVOQ. We are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of mace or malignancies with RINVOQ or any JAK inhibitor other than Celgene. We conducted a pool database analysis across our clinical trials for DBT, mace and malignancies at the time of RINVOQ's regulatory submission and have updated it periodically, including up to the presence. Rates with RINVOQ have not been elevated relative to comparators or to expected baseline rates. Importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. Additionally, we adjudicate events for Mace and DBT, which is considered the highest standard of evidence. 
If we look across our long-term database in RA, a population that is at increased risk for MACE events, our rates remain low. At the approved dose in RA, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients, totaling more than 9,000 patient years experience. Our rate of MACE events is 0.4 per 100-patient years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events per 100-patient years. 
In addition, there is no evidence of a dose response between the 15- and 30-milligram doses. Similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up, is 0.8 events per 100-patient years. This rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100-patient years. And again, we see no evidence of a dose response between 15 and 30 milligrams. 
Moving now to SKYRIZI. We also recently reported top line results from the Phase III programs for SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. In the 2 Crohn's induction studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week 4. Based on the data generated today, we believe SKYRIZI has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We expect to see results from the maintenance study in Crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. 
We're also very pleased with SKYRIZI's results in the Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. We believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the SKYRIZI program, make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. We're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well, where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021. We expect to begin 3 new studies for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate, including a Phase IIb dose-ranging study in RA as well as Phase II studies in Crohn's disease and Polymyalgia Remedica. And we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for [indiscernible], our CD40 antagonist in Phase II for ulcerative colitis and for ABBV-157, our oral ROR gamma T inhibitor in Phase I for psoriasis. Both of these programs experienced light COVID related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year. 
In oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year as well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including Genmab's by CD3xCD20 epcoritamab and I-Mab's anti-CD47 [indiscernible]. 
We showcased new data from several programs at the recent ASH meeting, where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from 8 different assets. Notable presentations included: data from the Phase II CAPTIVATE trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, which showed patients who achieved undetectable MRD following this combination, maintain their deep remission at the 1-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease-free survival. We also presented new 5-year data from Venclexta's Merano trial, demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration VENCLEXTA combinations in helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival. 
The latest results from Morano in the relapsed/refractory CLL setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the VENCLEXTA and rituximab group compared to 17 months in the bendamustine rituximab group, 3 or more years after stopping treatment. Updated dose escalation data from a Phase I study evaluating epcoritamab in B-cell malignancies were also presented at ASH. Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific CD3xCD20 antibody being developed in collaboration with Genmab. 
In the Phase I study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile, showing no grade 3 or higher CRS events as well as limited neurotoxicity. We believe that [indiscernible] has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The Phase III trial in relapsed refractory, DLBCL, recently began, and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses. 
Initial results were also presented from a Phase I study evaluating TNB-383B in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. TNB-383B is a novel bispecific T-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CD3 being developed in collaboration with Teneobio. These Phase I results demonstrated that the BCMA CD3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80%, with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better. Despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy. TNB-383B was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no grade 3 or higher CRS observed. With its safety profile, efficacy and the convenience of once every 3 week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. 
And our partner I-Mab, published an abstract with initial results from a Phase I study evaluating lemsip limb in AML and MDS. These results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed/refractory AML patients. And lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. Based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for emapalumab in AML, MDS and in multiple myeloma. We also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a Phase II study, evaluating [indiscernible] in heavily pretreated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. The encouraging results from stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program, with [indiscernible] demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR who have highly expressed CMEC. 
In EGFR wild-type patients with overexpressed Tmat, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. Based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for [indiscernible] in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer population. We will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. 
We expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline, with several regulatory submissions as well as data readouts across all stages of development. This year, we expect to see: data for IMBRUVICA in the Phase III SHINE study in frontline MCL with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year, data for IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in second-line or greater MCL and frontline CLL with regulatory submission for frontline CLL expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see data from registration-enabling studies for VENCLEXTA in high-risk MDS and navitoclax in relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis, and we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early-stage oncology pipeline. In addition, the programs under collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. 
Our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development. Importantly, we currently have programs which have advanced into clinical development in 2 areas: immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. The lead Calico program in oncology is focused on PTPN2 inhibitors. Which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. The discovery of novel, orally bioavailable PTPN2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough in a target class that has historically been considered undruggable. We currently have 2 assets in Phase I development, ABBV-CLS579 and 484. We've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway, and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. The lead Calico program in neuroscience is an EIF IIB activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease as well as in traumatic brain injury. 
Our lead EIF2b activator, ABBV-CLS7262 is currently progressing through Phase I and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with ALS. In other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention. And we recently submitted our regulatory application to the FDA. We expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter. The data generated in our Phase III programs were a strong benefit risk profile. And we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. 
In 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from 2 Phase III studies for Vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 in Advanced Parkinson's disease, with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year. 
We also expect to see proof-of-concept data for [indiscernible] in a Phase II study in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-AE12, our lead anti-tau antibody, in a Phase II study in Alzheimer's. In addition to AD12, we have a number of promising approaches in Alzheimer's, including our neuro inflammation programs aimed at TREM2 and CD33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tow approaches in preclinical development. These include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity as well as approaches to clear intracellular tow. 
In aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers, with several regulatory submissions, data readouts and pivotal study starts expected this year. Our programs include new indications for BOTOX as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations in both long and short-acting toxins. We also have programs to develop new indications for the JUVÉDERM collection as well as novel dermal fillers such as Harmonica, which will be entering registration-enabling studies in the U.S. 
And in eye care, based on the positive results from the Phase III studies evaluating our topical eye drop, AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia, we plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year. 
So in summary, our R&D productivity remained high last year despite multiple COVID-related challenges, and we were able to maintain study continuity and minimize delays. We're entering 2021 well positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline again this year. This includes 5 new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2021 guidance. Rob?"

We once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 bill",907,"Thank you, Mike. Starting with fourth quarter results. We once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. 
Immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. Within Immunology, Humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across international markets. 
SKYRIZI sales were $525 million, and RINVOQ sales were $281 million, with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. Hematologic oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. 
Aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion, with BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM, both experiencing a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by Vraylar and our migraine portfolio. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. 
Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $618 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. 
As we look ahead to 2021, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. 
We expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including: U.S. Humira growth of approximately 8%, international Humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $2.9 billion and RINVOQ global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect hematologic oncology to grow double digits, with IMBRUVICA global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from BOTOX Cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from JUVÉDERM. 
For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including: BOTOX Therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, RINVOQ sales of approximately $1.8 billion and UBRELVY sales of approximately $400 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from Restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. For women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. 
For our remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from Maviret, $1.2 billion from Creon, $1 billion from LINZESS, $800 million from Synthroid and $750 million from Lupron. 
Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.6 billion, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. 
We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to Q4 2020. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. 
Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $8.4 billion, and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. This fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio just below 2.5x by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. We anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid- to late-stage assets. 
In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2020. We've driven top-tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

As I said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data. Both at the time of the NDA and in an ongoing manner since that time, and we've not seen a signal. Our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates, and the rates overall remain low. 
With respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators. Regulators have not asked us do a long-term safety study in the way that Pfizer was asked. So that has not been discussed with regulators. And we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time.

And also, we're coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well, depending on where that dosing falls out. And we would be using at that point, which is known an on-body injector.

I'll take your question on margin progression. I think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from Allergan by next year and the P&L leverage that will come from the sales growth that we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through '22. Upon the entry of U.S. biosimilars in '23 and given Humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin and pullback. We've indicated before, the 45% range. Based on our current LRP, I think it will be a little bit higher than that. 
But then when we return to growth immediately -- in '24, we'll return to revenue growth, but very strong revenue growth starting in '25, you can expect then operating margins once again expand. We've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the P&L. And I would expect that to continue as we start to see very strong revenue growth starting in '25 and beyond."

I think that our optimism, and I think that's the right way to express it in a disease like MDD, which is a challenging disease to work in is based on a couple of features. One is based on the basic pharmacology of Vraylar, which has a unique mix of D3, D2, specificity and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings. It's also driven by the results that we have from the MDD study that is positive that we already have in hand. So with 1 positive study, we would need only 1 at least 1 or, of course, both of the next 2 studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. 
We've done a deep dive into the study design in the patient population. We think it's a well-designed study. And we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study. And we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study roles for the conduct of the study. And so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work. Well-designed study, well conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results. 
But as I mentioned, MDD is a challenging area. And for that reason, we didn't build it into our deal model, and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as Rick said. So we view this as upside."

We're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter, and I'll give you some context there. So when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate to severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least 2 and probably closer to 3x the size of the psoriasis market. So this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. It's also significantly underpenetrated. I mean if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single digits, the low single digits, where we are right now with the 1 biologic, dupilumab. So it's a very, very attractive. 
The other thing that I would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know that HCPs very intimately. So about 85% of the market is driven by the derms. We know the derms very well, and there's a 90% -- roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like SKYRIZI and our Humira. So we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. 
To get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know, with RINVOQ right now in the existing indication of RA. We have greater than 95% commercial access. That's the dominant channel for atopic derm. And our anticipation that we will have very strong access that will build to that level over the course of '21. Obviously, it's going to take some time once we get the approval, to go through the the final approvals on the big commercial plans. And so we see it starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year. So the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment as well as the allergy segment, give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond."

Obviously, if you look at the running rate, so out of the fourth quarter, had a strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter. But that's $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. The majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in RA. I think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the RA market. It takes time for physicians to start to adapt. Once they do, their momentum picks up. So I don't remember the specific number, and I'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway. But I would be thinking about it more that it's continued penetration and growth in RA that's driving the bulk of that growth.

So I'll cover the aesthetics question for you. I'd say as we've studied the aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, I think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market. I would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation. And I would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for. And we think that will -- certainly, you can see the response, like as an example, in BOTOX, already, we're seeing a very aggressive response and being able to grow the market. You saw the BOTOX grew -- BOTOX Cosmetics grew in the fourth quarter, 9%. I would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. 
And as part of legacy Allergan, I think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter-to-quarter where we have -- we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a long period. 
I'd say the second thing that's of interest to us is, I think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation if you fund that innovation in a way again, a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively and have a well thought out strategic road map as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. As Mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time. And the same with the filler market. There are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you can use fillers, both within the U.S. and globally. And that's a significant opportunity. But long term, we think there's an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at AbbVie and create more biologically active fillers that not only do physical filling but also improve taligen, improve elastin and other kinds of characteristics that would improve skin quality. And we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. 
And then the last thing I'd say is the geographic footprint that AbbVie has. We obviously have a very broad geographic footprint. And the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating in the aesthetics business, really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. 
A good case in point is I, believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in China to be able to increase the sales force there, to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in China to the next level down. And we've already seen the benefits of that. China is already back to growing much like it did pre-COVID. So I think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. 
On IMBRUVICA, maybe Jeff and I will tag-team on that one. What we're clearly seeing is that COVID is having an impact on patient starts in CLL. We're not only seeing it in IMBRUVICA, but we're seeing in bank Flex as well. And it's somewhat logical when you think about it, these oncology practices are trying to reduce density and CLL is a disease where you can -- in many pats cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. I would say that's the vast majority of it. 
When I look at the overall share, and the reason why I'm talking about the overall share, is VENCLEXTA is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. When I look at our overall shares in first line, second line or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position. And I'd say probably partially to your question, if I look at Calquence, I'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. I think the first-line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line, maybe 14%. And I don't recall to call the third line share."

I would say first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace. We tend to probably even to some extent, obsessively plan and go out and try to execute against that plan. And I think in times of difficulties, that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself. And that's where you see the biggest differences. So that's not to say other people don't do it. Like that. I'm not that familiar with how others operate, but I know how we operate. And I know how we contingency plan, and we look at, okay, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do? And we do that ahead of time. And if that doesn't work, what are we going to do? And I think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful. 
I'd say the second thing is, if I look at our business, we put a strategy in place, and I feel very good about how the business is performing overall. I mean I would say the business firing on all cylinders. And you can look at our fourth quarter performance, to your point. And I think it demonstrates that, and you can look at our guidance, and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was. And that, I think, is another indicator for you. And we have a much more diverse business now. We have 4 major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. Our new product launches are doing extremely well. Obviously, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are, but I'd also say UBRELVY and Vraylar, are performing extremely well. 
And the pipeline, I would say one of the things that gives me the most confidence is when I look at the pipeline behind that, that's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because 1 of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level it's performing over the long term. And so if I look I look at the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, R&D execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular, both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. 
When I look at our human strategy, we've had a very disciplined strategy there of ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow what has become a very large franchise for us. Our franchises is $6.6 billion, as we said, we're going to grow at double digits. Over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? Well, obviously, IMBRUVICA is going to continue to drive share, VENCLEXTA is going to continue to drive share in CLL. But VENCLEXTA has indication expansions into area potential, in areas like T1114 and a broader AML population and several other areas. 
Then I look at navitoclax. We should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis. And then you look at Genmab and you look at RCV47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. 
Neuroscience, same thing. [indiscernible] will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population. So I feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. So I think there's not 1 silver bullet that I can point to. I think it's all of those things. Certainly, our ability and market access has helped a lot in the U.S. I'd say we're very good at that. But you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. You have to have assets that are differentiated, like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So it's the combination of all of that, it gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance. And I feel awfully good about where we are."

With respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. 
And I would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. The first and most important is appropriate site selection. One has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators. Who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting. And that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. 
The next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that she would expect to treat post registration if the study is successful. And we've taken a look at all of these things. We've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data, and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout."

I mean we have a significant investment from an R&D standpoint and in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that Mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. So I'd say we have a significant R&D investment. We obviously are investing in Vraylar to continue to expand that asset. Again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum capture market share capture. I think if you look at Vraylar and you look at the projections that we've made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. And basically, we've been able to sustain that, and we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual in this market because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrist cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. So we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in. 
Same thing on BOTOX Therapeutics. Obviously, we have R&D programs in there to continue to expand the opportunities in therapeutics.

And when you look at the response on the migraine free days at the 10 to the 60 milligram, it's really impressive data. Very impressive data as this very strong oral. And so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. Obviously, you highlighted the leveraging ubrelvy. We've got dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists as well as the headache specialist. They'll actually carry both UBRELVY and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focused on the big primary care writers that see a lot of the migraine sufferers. So this is an important dynamic that will we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market towards the end of the year. 
Also, we're looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey. So patients are on BOTOX Therapeutics, for example, which is very substantial. It's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. But many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. So ultimately, the combination of BOTOX plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long-term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's UBRELVY on the front end with acute, atogepant in the middle oral for episodic and chronic or BOTOX on the back end, we think it's a nice portfolio that we can commercially manage over time to hit our ambitions that Rob described."

ABBV-154, our TNF steri conjugate, has not been delayed because of COVID. There were some delays in other early immunology programs, our CD40 and our ROR gamma T program experienced modest delays, but 154 did not. 
As we said at the time of the COVID peak over the course of the last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment. The programs that I'm talking about, CD40 and ROR gamma T were impacted modestly in that time period, but 154 was not. So that remains on track. We remain confident in it. We have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. Remember that we had 2, 3373 and 154, and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in [indiscernible] technology. We're planning to initiate a large Phase IIb study in the first half of this year. And then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying Phase II Crohn's disease as well as Polymyalgia Rheumatica. And so that's an important set of indications. It covers a wide range of opportunities, RA and Crohn's disease are areas where we're very active. 
PMR, Polymyalgia Rheumatica, is a new area where there's not a lot of therapeutics. Unfortunately, it's a well-established area in medicine, but there's very little in terms of treatment for these patients. They have considerable pain suffering from their conditions, and it's particularly steroid responsive. So we think it is a very attractive target for a steroid ADC approach. 
So 154 remains on track, and we continue to have confidence in it."

We had a few inbound questions on the treatment of the royalty, and I know you've answered this question a little bit in the past, but also just noticing the big noncash GAAP charge you took this quarter. You back out of non-GAAP earnings. So I know you have described accounting for this as a business combination. But can you maybe give a little bit more color on the rationale and the accounting behind that noncash charge? 
And then is there also some threshold number or other event where you'd add this royalty expense back to non-GAAP? And then on ABBV-951, we picked up a decent amount of KOL excitement around this asset in Parkinson's. I know Phase III is expected later this year. But I wonder if you could maybe talk about the launch, your launch expectations on this and maybe contrast it to the Duodopa experience, just from our feedback, it seems like this could expand the addressable PD population pretty sizably.

And you did see us take a fair value write-up this quarter based on the higher sales outlook, as we communicated during the immunology Day event in December and that you see in the guidance we provide today. Obviously, the outlook for SKYRIZI continues to increase, and so we're recognizing that liability going forward. We also take into consideration because it's a fair value measure what the market is assuming. So it's not just our own forecast, it's also what Street expectations are. And those have also increased, as we've seen a very nice ramp. We're starting to see, obviously, the confidence from the Street increase, and that's translate into a higher outlook for SKYRIZI, which then translates to a higher future potential royalties. 
One of the reasons I wanted to stress also on the free cash flow in my remarks today, is because there is some confusion over -- that's how we account for it, but it's important to keep in mind that when I talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments of 2 BI. And so you can look at a few different ways. You can look at it from a -- if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully, what does that contribute to overall cash flow. So we would not be going back. We made a determination as a business combination. We don't -- we should not anticipate that we would reverse that. But we'll provide, obviously, more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset."

So on number two, Jeff and I will cover number 2. How do you sort of a high level look, and then Jeff, maybe give you more specificity around it. If you look at Duodopa, I mean this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy. You can see these patients who cannot move really and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug. And within a very short period of time, they regained their motion. The challenge is a very difficult treatment to -- for the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long-term sustainable basis. You have to do surgery, insert the G tube, you have to maintain that G tube open. So that does somewhat limit the population is able to use it. And so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market. And Jeff is obviously far more familiar with it, so I'll let him give you a little more specific. But that's the general concept. I think this could be a significant -- wanted to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy; and two, I think you could expand the market pretty significantly."

It's -- we hear the same thing from our KOLs. They're very, very encouraged. And with the perspective, you look at Duopa or Duodopa about a $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on onboarding for these patients, right? You have to do the JPEG surgery. You have challenges with the size of the pump. Nonetheless, it's so remarkable that we do get that level of sales. So if I give you some perspective on the market, if you look at the advanced Parkinson's disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any relief. And then they're still in big trouble. So only a minority, about 10% ever get to, let's say, more advanced device-aided therapy, which is Duopa or Duodopa and deep brain stimulation. 
So as we study the market, we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way, a simple way for a neurologist to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure. Whether it's brain surgery or the GI surgery, we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of the really nonworkable oral segment. So we are encouraged at the recent feedback from our KOLs and our study sites and are anticipating and planning for our launch in the coming years."

I would say from the standpoint of of the comparison between RINVOQ and XELJANZ. I mean the -- if you look at the penetration of the JAK class, really across the world and particularly in the U.S., there has been a significant lift that we just talked about with that in play share. And so really, what we're hearing from the field and from the prescribers are they view RINVOQ as a differentiated asset in terms of the overall risk benefit, and that's why that share is moving so quickly. And so that's really what we hear in the early days from our teams that are connected to those big rheumatologists. So"

I'll take the question on the hem/onc portfolio, mid-stage and newer technologies. What I would say is there is a lot going on in our Hemonc portfolio, obviously, with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage I think you'll see a focus on T cell redirection, which is, of course, a newer technology. And I think, a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers. And you see good progress with our CD3xCD20 and our BCMA T-cell redirecting therapies. And so that is clearly an area of focus for us now, and I think we'll continue to be in the future. 
With respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing that can be used in different ways. Gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. Gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell based therapies, and we have early programs in cell-based therapies in hem/onc and in other areas, solid tumor oncology and potentially other areas in the future. And so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. I think that for those sorts of approaches were probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable, but we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next-generation needs. And so we are keeping a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. What I mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. We don't find a tool and then figure out how to use it. And so in each of these cases, we're going after strong biology. We're going after we think we'll raise the bar on the standard of care. And I think a number of the newer technologies that I mentioned fit that bill."

I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 performance as well as our expectations for 2021. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and Rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions.  
We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Fourth quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. This performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hem/onc and neuroscience franchises as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of BOTOX Cosmetics, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery.  
Our fourth quarter performance tops off another excellent and truly transformational year for AbbVie, which included the successful acquisition and integration of Allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse AbbVie; with leadership across numerous attractive, high-growth markets; significant contributions from our 2 new best-in-category immunology medicines, RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. 
We expect the combined contribution from RINVOQ and SKYRIZI to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion, based on their continued strong uptake in RA and psoriasis as well as RINVOQ's anticipated approvals in PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis later this year.  
We delivered continued robust growth from our leading hem/onc portfolio, with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. We expect our hem/onc franchise to grow double digits again in 2021. We also added 2 compelling oncology pipeline assets: epcoritamab, a potential best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody in development for B-cell malignancies; and lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. These 2 assets will further support the growth of our hem/onc franchise across our long-range plan.  
The acquisition of Allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions, augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. The newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021. 
We also added the leading global Aesthetics franchise, a largely cash paid portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. As I've previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid V-shaped recovery, and we view Aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. And importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. 
We expect our R&D pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next 2 years, including a total of 6 additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which will cover all of Humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis; expanded indications for Venclexta and Vraylar and several new product approvals, including atogepant, for episodic migraine, navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. These new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the U.S. Humira LoE.  
We've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4%, with total AbbVie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus. And we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. This level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021.  
The Allergan integration continues to go very well. The transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic. While we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which Rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous Allergan growth platforms. 
As we recently disclosed, we believe UBRELVY, the first to market and leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity; atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. We expect Vraylar peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression. With major depressive disorder, or MDD, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity. 
Aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year, is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. 
We continue to closely monitor the COVID dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. And despite the recent COVID resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global health care system is much better equipped with COVID treatment protocols and PPE to safely see and treat patients throughout the current year.  
That said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like CLL, HCV, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance. 
Overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. 
So in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets, and the outlook for AbbVie's business remains strong, with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025, and our expectations for continued robust growth across hem/onc, neuroscience and Aesthetics. We have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the Humira LoE impact in 2023 supporting an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade with the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

We've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with IMBRUVICA and Venclexta and in immunology with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Since inception, our R&D organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. 
We also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs, with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years. We will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for AbbVie in the second half of the decade.  
At our recent Immunology Investor Event in December, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to date for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across approved and pipeline indications. Included in this event, we presented positive top line data from 2 new Phase III studies for RINVOQ, results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilimab and atopic dermatitis. We expect to see results from the second Phase III UC induction study later this quarter and from the UC maintenance study in the middle of this year. With regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021.  
Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are currently under review, and we expect an approval decision in the U.S. in the second quarter based on priority review and in Europe in the second half of the year. We recently received European Commission approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the U.S. in the first half of this year.  
I want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically MACE and malignancies, following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. At present, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study apply to a specific JAK1 inhibitor such as RINVOQ. We are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of MACE or malignancies with RINVOQ or any JAK inhibitor other than XELJANZ. 
We conducted a pool database analysis across our clinical trials for DVT, MACE and malignancies at the time of RINVOQ's regulatory submission and have updated it periodically, including up to the present. Rates with RINVOQ have not been elevated relative to comparators or to expected baseline rates. Importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. Additionally, we adjudicate events for MACE and DVT, which is considered the highest standard of evidence.  
If we look across our long-term database in RA, a population that is at increased risk for MACE events, our rates remain low. At the approved dose in RA, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients, totaling more than 9,000 patient years experience. Our rate of MACE events is 0.4 per 100-patient years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events per 100-patient years.  In addition, there is no evidence of a dose response between the 15- and 30-milligram doses. 
Similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up, is 0.8 events per 100-patient years. This rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100-patient years. And again, we see no evidence of a dose response between 15 and 30 milligrams.  
Moving now to SKYRIZI. We also recently reported top line results from the Phase III programs for SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. In the 2 Crohn's induction studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week 4. Based on the data generated today, we believe SKYRIZI has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We expect to see results from the maintenance study in Crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. 
We're also very pleased with SKYRIZI's results in the Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. We believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the SKYRIZI program, make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. 
We're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well, where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021. We expect to begin 3 new studies for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate, including a Phase IIb dose-ranging study in RA as well as Phase II studies in Crohn's disease and polymyalgia rheumatica. And we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for Ravagalimab, our CD40 antagonist in Phase II for ulcerative colitis and for ABBV-157, our oral RORgamma t inhibitor in Phase I for psoriasis. 
Both of these programs experienced slight COVID related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year.  
In oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year as well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including Genmab's CD3xCD20 epcoritamab and I-Mab's anti-CD47 lemzoparlimab.  
We showcased new data from several programs at the recent ASH meeting, where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from 8 different assets. Notable presentations included: data from the Phase II CAPTIVATE trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA plus Venclexta in frontline CLL, which showed patients who achieved undetectable MRD following this combination, maintain their deep remission at the 1-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease-free survival. We also presented new 5-year data from Venclexta's MURANO trial, demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration Venclexta combinations in helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival.  
The latest results from MURANO in the relapsed/refractory CLL setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the Venclexta and rituximab group compared to 17 months in the bendamustine rituximab group, 3 or more years after stopping treatment. Updated dose escalation data from a Phase I study evaluating epcoritamab in B-cell malignancies were also presented at ASH. Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific CD3xCD20 antibody being developed in collaboration with Genmab.  
In the Phase I study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile, showing no grade 3 or higher CRS events as well as limited neurotoxicity. We believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The Phase III trial in relapsed refractory, DLBCL, recently began, and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses.  
Initial results were also presented from a Phase I study evaluating TNB-383B in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. TNB-383B is a novel bispecific T-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CD3 being developed in collaboration with Teneobio. These Phase I results demonstrated that the BCMA CD3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80%, with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy. 
TNB-383B was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no grade 3 or higher CRS observed. With its safety profile, efficacy and the convenience of once every 3 week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. And our partner I-Mab, published an abstract with initial results from a Phase I study evaluating lemzoparlimab in AML and MDS. These results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed/refractory AML patients. And lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. 
Based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and in multiple myeloma. 
We also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a Phase II study, evaluating Teliso-V in heavily pretreated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. The encouraging results from stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program, with Teliso-V demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR who have highly expressed cMet.  
In EGFR wild-type patients with overexpressed cMet, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. 
Based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for Teliso-V in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer population. We will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. 
We expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline, with several regulatory submissions as well as data readouts across all stages of development. This year, we expect to see: data for IMBRUVICA in the Phase III SHINE study in frontline MCL with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year, data for IMBRUVICA in combination with Venclexta in second-line or greater MCL and frontline CLL with regulatory submission for frontline CLL expected in the second half of the year. 
We also expect to see data from registration-enabling studies for Venclexta in high-risk MDS and navitoclax in relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis, and we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early-stage oncology pipeline. 
In addition, the programs under collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. Our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development. Importantly, we currently have programs which have advanced into clinical development in 2 areas: immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. 
The lead Calico program in oncology is focused on PTPN2 inhibitors. Which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. The discovery of novel, orally bioavailable PTPN2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough in a target class that has historically been considered undruggable. We currently have 2 assets in Phase I development, ABBV-CLS-579 and 484. We've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway, and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. 
The lead Calico program in neuroscience is an eIF2B activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease as well as in traumatic brain injury.  
Our lead eIF2B activator, ABBV-CLS-7262 is currently progressing through Phase I and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with ALS. 
In other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention. And we recently submitted our regulatory application to the FDA. We expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter. The data generated in our Phase III programs support a strong benefit risk profile. And we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. 
In 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from 2 Phase III studies for Vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease, with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year.  
We also expect to see proof-of-concept data for Elezanumab in a Phase II study in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12, our lead anti-tau antibody, in a Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to 8E12, we have a number of promising approaches in Alzheimer's, including our neuro inflammation programs aimed at TREM2 and CD33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tau approaches in preclinical development. These include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity as well as approaches to clear intracellular tau. In Aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers, with several regulatory submissions, data readouts and pivotal study starts expected this year. 
Our programs include new indications for BOTOX as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations in both long and short-acting toxins. We also have programs to develop new indications for the JUVÉDERM collection as well as novel dermal fillers such as HArmonyCA, which will be entering registration-enabling studies in the U.S. 
And in eye care, based on the positive results from the Phase III studies evaluating our topical eye drop, AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. We plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year.  
So in summary, our R&D productivity remained high last year despite multiple COVID-related challenges, and we were able to maintain study continuity and minimize delays. We're entering 2021 well positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline again this year. This includes 5 new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2021 guidance. Rob?"

We once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 bill",907,"Thank you, Mike. Starting with fourth quarter results. We once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. 
Immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. Within Immunology, Humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across international markets. 
SKYRIZI sales were $525 million, and RINVOQ sales were $281 million, with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. Hematologic oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from IMBRUVICA and Venclexta. 
Aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion, with BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM, both experiencing a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by Vraylar and our migraine portfolio. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. 
Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $618 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. 
As we look ahead to 2021, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. 
We expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including: U.S. Humira growth of approximately 8%, international Humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $2.9 billion and RINVOQ global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect hematologic oncology to grow double digits, with IMBRUVICA global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and Venclexta global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from BOTOX Cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from JUVÉDERM. 
For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including: BOTOX Therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, Vraylar sales of approximately $1.8 billion and UBRELVY sales of approximately $400 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. For women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. 
For our remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from MAVYRET, $1.2 billion from Creon, $1 billion from LINZESS, $800 million from Synthroid and $750 million from Lupron. 
Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.6 billion, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. 
We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to Q4 2020. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. 
Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $8.4 billion, and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. This fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio just below 2.5x by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. We anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid- to late-stage assets. 
In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2020. We've driven top-tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

And then secondly, on SKYRIZI, a commercial question. Your current price for the 150-milligram dose is about $85,000, and you're using 4x the dose for ulcerative colitis. Could you just tell us how you can manage that? And is it feasible to have sort of different prices despite that big difference in dosing?"

As I said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data. Both at the time of the NDA and in an ongoing manner since that time, and we've not seen a signal. Our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates, and the rates overall remain low. 
With respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators. Regulators have not asked us do a long-term safety study in the way that Pfizer was asked. So that has not been discussed with regulators. And we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time.

And also, we're coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well, depending on where that dosing falls out. And we would be using at that point, which is known an on-body injector.

I'll take your question on margin progression. I think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from Allergan by next year and the P&L leverage that will come from the sales growth that we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through '22. Upon the entry of U.S. biosimilars in '23 and given Humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin and pullback. We've indicated before, the 45% range. Based on our current LRP, I think it will be a little bit higher than that. 
But then when we return to growth immediately -- in '24, we'll return to revenue growth, a very strong revenue growth starting in '25, you can expect then operating margins once again expand. We've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the P&L. And I would expect that to continue as we start to see very strong revenue growth starting in '25 and beyond."

I think that our optimism, and I think that's the right way to express it in a disease like MDD, which is a challenging disease to work and is based on a couple of features. One is based on the basic pharmacology of Vraylar, which has a unique mix of D3, D2, specificity and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings. It's also driven by the results that we have from the MDD study that is positive that we already have in hand. So with 1 positive study, we would need only 1 at least 1 or, of course, both of the next 2 studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. 
We've done a deep dive into the study design in the patient population. We think it's a well-designed study. And we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study. And we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study roles for the conduct of the study. And so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work. Well-designed study, well conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results. 
But as I mentioned, MDD is a challenging area. And for that reason, we didn't build it into our deal model, and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as Rick said. So we view this as upside."

We're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter, and I'll give you some context there. So when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate-to-severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least 2 and probably closer to 3x the size of the psoriasis market. And so this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. It's also significantly underpenetrated. I mean if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single digits, the low single digits, where we are right now with the 1 biologic, dupilumab. So it's very, very attractive. 
The other thing that I would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know that HCPs very intimately. So about 85% of the market is driven by the derms. We know the derms very well, and there's a 90% -- roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like SKYRIZI and/or Humira. So we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. 
To get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know, with RINVOQ right now in the existing indication of RA. We have greater than 95% commercial access. That's the dominant channel for atopic derm. And our anticipation is we will have very strong access that will build to that level over the course of '21. 
Obviously, it's going to take some time once we get the approval, to go through the final approvals on the big commercial plans. And so we see it starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year. So the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment as well as the allergy segment, give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond."

Obviously, if you look at the running rate, so out of the fourth quarter, had a strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter. But that's $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. 
The majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in RA. I think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the RA market. It takes time for physicians to start to adapt it. Once they do, their momentum picks up. So I don't remember the specific number, and I'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway. But I would be thinking about it more that it's continued penetration and growth in RA that's driving the bulk of that growth.

I'd say as we've studied the Aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, I think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market. I would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation. And I would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for. And we think that will -- certainly, you can see the response, like as an example, in BOTOX, already, we're seeing a very aggressive response and being able to grow the market. You saw the BOTOX grew -- BOTOX Cosmetics grew in the fourth quarter, 9%. I would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. 
And as part of legacy Allergan, I think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter-to-quarter where we have -- we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a long period of time. 
I'd say the second thing that's of interest to us is, I think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation, if you fund that innovation in a way again, a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively and have a well thought out strategic road map as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. 
As Mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time. And the same with the filler market. There are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you can use fillers, both within the U.S. and globally. And that's a significant opportunity. 
But long term, we think there's an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at AbbVie and create more biologically active fillers that not only do physical filling but also improve collagen, improve elastin and other kinds of characteristics that would improve skin quality. And we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. 
And then the last thing I'd say is the geographic footprint that AbbVie has. We obviously have a very broad geographic footprint. And the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating in the Aesthetics business, really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. 
A good case in point is I, believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in China to be able to increase the sales force there, to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in China to the next level down. And we're already seeing the benefits of that. China is already back to growing much like it did pre-COVID. So I think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. 
On IMBRUVICA, maybe Jeff and I will tag-team on that one. What we're clearly seeing is that COVID is having an impact on patient starts in CLL. We're not only seeing it in IMBRUVICA, but we're seeing it in Venclexta as well. And it's somewhat logical when you think about it, these oncology practices are trying to reduce density and CLL is a disease where you can -- in many patients' cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. I would say that's the vast majority of it. 
When we look at -- when I look at the overall share, and the reason why I'm talking about the overall share, is Venclexta is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. When I look at our overall shares in first line, second line or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position. And I'd say probably partially to your question, if I look at Calquence, I'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. I think the first-line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line, maybe 14%. And I don't recall the third line share."

I'm sure you monitor the competition. So beyond the AbbVie management team itself, what about your business? Do you think is allowing you to execute in this way? Would you attribute it to -- mainly to the products themselves, the payer strategies, geographic mix? Or is there something else? 
And the second question is the ongoing Vraylar Phase III trials utilize doses up to 3 milligrams, while the successful prior trials were up to 4.5 milligrams. So why were the doses lowered in the first place? And what placebo response mitigation methods are included in the ongoing trials?"

I would say first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace. We tend to probably even to some extent, obsessively plan and go out and try to execute against that plan. And I think in times of difficulties, that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself. And that's where you see the biggest differences. 
So that's not to say other people don't do it. Like that. I'm not that familiar with how others operate, but I know how we operate. And I know how we contingency plan, and we look at, okay, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do? And we do that ahead of time. And if that doesn't work, what are we going to do? And I think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful. 
I'd say the second thing is, if I look at our business, we put a strategy in place, and I feel very good about how the business is performing overall. I mean I would say the business firing on all cylinders. And you can look at our fourth quarter performance, to your point. And I think it demonstrates that, and you can look at our guidance, and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was. And that, I think, is another indicator for you. 
And we have a much more diverse business now. We have 4 major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. Our new product launches are doing extremely well. Obviously, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are, but I'd also say UBRELVY and Vraylar, are performing extremely well. 
And the pipeline, I would say one of the things that gives me the most confidence is when I look at the pipeline behind that, that's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because 1 of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level it's performing over the long term. And so if I look -- I look at the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, R&D execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular, both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. 
When I look at our hem/onc strategy, we've got a very disciplined strategy there of ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow what has become a very large franchise for us. Our franchise is $6.6 billion, as we said, we're going to grow at double digits. Over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? Well, obviously, IMBRUVICA is going to continue to drive share, Venclexta is going to continue to drive share in CLL. But Venclexta has indication expansions into area potential, in areas like  t(11;14) and a broader AML population and several other areas. 
Then I look at navitoclax. We should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis. And then you look at Genmab and you look at our CD47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. 
Neuroscience, same thing. Atogepant will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population. So I feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. So I think there's not 1 silver bullet that I can point to. I think it's all of those things. Certainly, our ability and market access has helped a lot in the U.S. I'd say we're very good at that. But you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. You have to have assets that are differentiated, like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So it's the combination of all of that, it gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance. And I feel awfully good about where we are."

And what I would say there is that the dose selection was based on everything we know about dose response, not only from the prior MDD studies, but across the program, and we've done a deep dive into that, and we're confident that we're at a dose that ought to have optimal effect in these indications -- in this indication. With respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. 
And I would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. The first and most important is appropriate site selection. One has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators. Who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting. And that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. 
The next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that you would expect to treat post registration if the study is successful. And we've taken a look at all of these things. We've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data, and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout."

I mean we have a significant investment from an R&D standpoint and in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that Mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. So I'd say we have a significant R&D investment. We obviously are investing in Vraylar to continue to expand that asset. 
Again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum capture -- market share capture. I think if you look at Vraylar and you look at the projections that we've made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. And basically, we've been able to sustain that, and we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual in this market because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrists cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. 
So we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in. Same thing on BOTOX Therapeutic. Obviously, we have R&D programs in there to continue to expand the opportunities in therapeutics.

And when you look at the response on the migraine free days at the 10 to the 60 milligram, it's really impressive data. Very impressive data as this very strong oral. And so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. 
Obviously, you highlighted the leveraging UBRELVY. We've got dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists as well as the headache specialists. They'll actually carry both UBRELVY and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focused on the big primary care writers that see a lot of the migraine sufferers. So this is an important dynamic that we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market towards the end of the year. 
Also, we're looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey. So patients are on BOTOX Therapeutic, for example, which is very substantial. It's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. But many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. So ultimately, the combination of BOTOX plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long-term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's UBRELVY on the front end with acute, atogepant in the middle, oral for episodic and chronic or BOTOX on the back end.

There were some delays in other early immunology programs, our CD40 and our RORgamma t program experienced modest delays, but 154 did not. 
As we said at the time of the COVID peak over the course of the last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment. The programs that I'm talking about, CD40 and RORgamma t were impacted modestly in that time period, but 154 was not. So that remains on track. We remain confident in it. We have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. Remember that we had 2, 3373 and 154, and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in linker technology. 
We're planning to initiate a large Phase IIb study in the first half of this year. And then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying Phase II Crohn's disease as well as polymyalgia rheumatica. And so that's an important set of indications. It covers a wide range of opportunities, RA and Crohn's disease are areas where we're very active. 
PMR, polymyalgia rheumatica, is a new area where there's not a lot of therapeutics. Unfortunately, it's a well-established area in medicine, but there's very little in terms of treatment for these patients. They have considerable pain and suffering from their conditions, and it's particularly steroid responsive. So we think it is a very attractive target for a steroid ADC approach.

One of the reasons I wanted to stress also on the free cash flow in my remarks today, is because there is some confusion over -- that's how we account for it, but it's important to keep in mind that when I talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments of -- to BI. 
And so you can look at a few different ways. You can look at it from a -- if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully, what does that contribute to overall cash flow. So we would not be going back. We made a determination as a business combination. We don't -- we should not anticipate that we would reverse that. But we'll provide, obviously, more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset."

The accounting said it had to be accounted for in that form -- in that fashion. It's since been changed going forward, but the window at which we -- that occurred, that was the required accounting treatment. 
So on number two, Jeff and I will cover number 2. I'll give you sort of a high level look, and then Jeff, maybe give you more specificity around it. If you look at Duodopa, I mean this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy. You can see these patients who cannot move really and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug. And within a very short period of time, they regained their motion. The challenge is a very difficult treatment to -- for the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long-term sustainable basis. You have to do surgery, insert the G-tube, you have to maintain that G-tube open. 
So that does somewhat limit the population that is able to use it. And so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market. And Jeff is obviously far more familiar with it, so I'll let him give you a little more specifics. But that's the general concept. I think this could be a significant -- wanted to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy; and two, I think you could expand the market pretty significantly."

It's -- we hear the same thing from our KOLs. They're very, very encouraged. And with the perspective, you look at Duopa or Duodopa about a $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on onboarding for these patients, right? You have to do the Jpeg surgery. You have challenges with the size of the pump. Nonetheless, it's so remarkable that we do get that level of sales. 
So if I give you some perspective on the market, if you look at the advanced Parkinson's disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any relief. And then they're still in big trouble. So only a minority, about 10% ever get to, let's say, more advanced device-aided therapy, which is Duopa or Duodopa and deep brain stimulation. 
So as we study the market, we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way, a simple way for a neurologist to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure. Whether it's brain surgery or the GI surgery, we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of the really nonworkable oral segment. So we are encouraged at the recent feedback from our KOLs and our study sites and are anticipating and planning for our launch in the coming years."

What I would say is there is a lot going on in our hem/onc portfolio. Obviously, with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage I think you'll see a focus on T cell redirection, which is, of course, a newer technology. And I think, a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers. And you see good progress with our CD3xCD20 and our BCMA T-cell redirecting therapies. And so that is clearly an area of focus for us now, and I think we'll continue to be in the future. 
With respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing, it can be used in different ways. Gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. Gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell-based therapies, and we have early programs in cell-based therapies in hem/onc and in other areas, solid tumor oncology and potentially other areas in the future. And so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. I think that for those sorts of approaches were probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable, but we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next-generation needs. And so we are keeping a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. What I mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. We don't find a tool and then figure out how to use it. And so in each of these cases, we're going after strong biology. We're going after we think we'll raise the bar on the standard of care. And I think a number of the newer technologies that I mentioned fit that bill."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our first quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. We're off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. 
Total adjusted net revenues of $12.9 billion was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. These results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas. Including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics as well as high single-digit operational growth from hematological oncology. Additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. 
IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion. Reflecting continued leadership in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Baylor, which remains one of the fastest-growing medicines in psychiatry. And delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis. And within our leading aesthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre cover levels, BOTOX Cosmetics and JUVÉDERM are demonstrating robust performance. Both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. 
The integration of Allergan also continues to go very well. As illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company. With the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. While the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. We see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in March, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-COVID levels, including CLL and HCV in particular. 
We expect the increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a full recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. Based on a robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. And we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. 
I'm also extremely pleased with our R&D prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, especially within our late-stage pipeline. We're on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next 2 years, including 5 total expected approvals in 2021. This includes Japan, a novel oral CGRP for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio, a new eye drop with the treatment of presbyopia, as well as expanded indications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. 
And we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for Advanced Parkinson's disease, SKYRIZI for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease, Rindbo for ulcerative colitis, velar for major depressive disorder and additional indications for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. With these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long-term outlook remains very strong. 
In closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. I'm pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. We're off to another excellent start in 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?"

We demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. Our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. Humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. 
Our new immunology agents SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are both demonstrating robust prescription growth, well above all comparable launches. SKYRIZI sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. This is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to Humira. 
Additionally, we recently received approval for a single dose prefilled pen for SKYRIZI, which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. SKYRIZI is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience. RINVOQ sales were $303 million with strong in play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. Physician and patient feedback remain very positive on RINVOQ's level of efficacy speed of response and strong benefit risk profile. 
Internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access and share. SKYRIZI has now also achieved in play patient share leadership in the EU5 psoriasis market, exceeding Tremfya and Cosentyx and at parity with Taltz. As Mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in several immune-mediated diseases, with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. 
In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. IMBRUVICA continues to perform well across multiple indications, including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. IMBRUVICA sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter, with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. IMBRUVICA growth was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. 
VENCLEXTA sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis, with increasing share in frontline CLL and continued strong performance in AML. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. 
Within migraine, the launch of UBRELVY is exceeding our expectations, with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. Feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy's efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is the #1 branded acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. 
The oral CGRP therapies, including our leading ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. We believe there's substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. We also look forward to the expected commercial approval of atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine later this year. 
BOTOX Therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas. We saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. MAVYRET sales were $415 million down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels. And we also saw double-digit comparable growth from Linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or chronic idiopathic constipation. 
Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on track to deliver a very strong revenue growth in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

I'll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new disease areas as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. We recently reported positive top line results from the second induction study for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis. Similar to results from the first induction study, in this Phase III trial, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. The 45-milligram induction dose was well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previous RINVOQ studies. 
In these induction trials, we saw no DVT, PE, MACE events or malignancies in the RINVOQ groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. We believe these induction data compare very favorably to other UC treatments on the market or in development. And based on the data generated to date, RINVOQ has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. 
We expect to see results from the UC maintenance study this summer, with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. The RINVOQ programming Crohn's disease is also progressing very well. And we expect to see induction data from the first of 2 Phase III trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second Phase III trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022.

Earlier this year, we reported positive results from the 2 Crohn's induction studies, and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. Our regulatory submissions for SKYRIZI and Crohn's disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. Following completion of our registrational program for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022. 
We're very pleased with the level of activity we saw with SKYRIZI on both joint disease and skin clearance in our Phase III program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are currently under review for RINVOQ in 3 new indications in the U.S., ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis. 
As we previously announced, the FDA recently extended the review period for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis, following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit risk profile for RINVOQ in these indications. In response to the FDA request, we provided updated data from across RINVOQ programs in RA, psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in June and for atopic dermatitis in July. The regulatory action date for RINVOQ in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for June. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile of RINVOQ across all indications, and we'll work with the FDA to bring RINVOQ to market in these new disease areas. 
Earlier this year, we received European approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and AS. Our European regulatory application for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis is under review, and we remain on track for a CHMP opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. We also recently saw results from a 4-week Phase Ib study, evaluating our novel small molecule RORgamma T inverse agonist, ABBV-157 in patients with psoriasis. By targeting RORgamma t with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit IL-17 production. Thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. 
In our Phase Ib study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger Phase IIb dose-ranging study in the second half of this year. 
Moving now to our oncology portfolio. We continue to make very good progress with our late-stage programs for IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA and NAVITOCLAX as well as with our early-stage oncology assets. We remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations and phased transitions this year. At the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA CAPTIVATE trial, fix duration cohort in treatment-naive CLL patients. 
The IMBRUVICA VENCLEXTA combination is an important element of our hem/onc strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. Data from our IMBRUVICA VENCLEXTA combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline CLL later this year. We will also be presenting 4-year follow-up data from VENCLEXTA'S CLL 14 trial in frontline CLL as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a Phase Ib study evaluating VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine in treatment-naive, high-risk MDS patients. 
We expect this MDS study to complete in the second half of this year, and if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. 
In the area of solid tumors, at the recent AACR meeting, we presented Phase II results for Teliso-V in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Teliso-V demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed cMet, where we saw a 54% objective response rate. cMet is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where approximately 30% of patients have overexpressed he met. Approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti cMet antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. In contrast, our cMet antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. 
We recently began the second stage of our Phase II study, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also plan to evaluate teleco V in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents as well as in other cMet positive tumor types. We also have a next-generation cMet ADC program that will be entering the clinic later this year. 
Our new cMet ADC, ABBV-400 utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which we believe will provide greater antitumor efficacy against both amplified met and overexpressed cMet subtypes. Thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti cMet targeting agents. 
In neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. A total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the Phase III ADVANCE study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well-tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset of action. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine, and an approval decision is expected in September of this year. 
We also presented results from an open-label Phase III study evaluating UBRELVY in peri menstrual migraine, which showed that UBRELVY has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment of migraine attacks that occurred during or near menstruation. Menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult-to-treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe and often resistant to treatment. 
And we presented data from a Phase I study demonstrating that ABBV-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent levodopa exposure to Duopa in advanced Parkinson's patients. Results from the pivotal program for ABBV 951 are expected this summer, with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. We also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from 2 Phase III studies for Vraylar, an adjunctive major depressive disorder. And if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. 
In eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for AGN-190584 and for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eyedrop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. This new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. An approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. 
And in aesthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next-generation toxins and filler programs. By combining the aesthetic team's deep expertise, with AbbVie's breadth and scale of resources, we'll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. Looking across our portfolio, we've identified a number of programs to accelerate. Including our short-acting and long-acting toxins as well as our next-generation Bio stimulatory tropoelastin and collage and fillers. Acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long-term growth for the aesthetics franchise. 
So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. 
Net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.1% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. 
At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect international Humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion. And we now expect BOTOX cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. 
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. 
Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. We have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. We continue to expect cumulative debt paydown of $17 billion by the end of 2021, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4x by the end of 2021 and approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year, with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

And then my second question was just a little bit more color on the aesthetic dynamics, I guess, is there anything we're seeing with the results we're seeing very, very strong here. Is there any catch-up type event as the world reopens that we're seeing with these results? Or are these kind of sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations of that business, trying to get a sense of just how to think about that progressing as we go through the rest of the year."

With respect to RINVOQ, we feel very confident in the benefit risk profile across indications and across the doses that we've studied. Having said that, both the 15 and 30-milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective. And so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response. And had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms with 15 as well as with 30. And with the 15-milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in edge after only 2 days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. And again, that's really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. So we think we could be successful with either dose to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit risk of both doses."

I'll cover the aesthetics one for you, as Mike said. I think if you look at the underlying performance of the aesthetics business, in particular, the market growth in the U.S. and in China, it's driving the fundamental growth that we see to the business. Certainly, there is some impact still from COVID. So we're seeing some impact there. But I think the majority of it is, when we took over Allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in a prior and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that we'll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level. To drive demand because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. And I think the best comparisons are starting to look at what it looked like versus 2019 because you obviously have the COVID impact in 2020. And but you take, for example, BOTOX, BOTOX versus 2019, cosmetic BOTOX versus 2019, it's up about 27%. The market is growing very robustly. Some of that is probably cover driven. These are U.S. numbers I'm describing right now. Some of that is probably cover driven. But I wouldn't say a lot of it at this point is Co driven in the U.S.-China continues to grow very well. In fact, I'd say, China is back to the level of growth. And we have expanded the sales force in China once about 4 or 5 months ago. We're in the process now of going through a second expansion in China. I would expect that China will continue to drive significant growth going forward. The one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from COVID is the European market. We still see it starting -- we see it starting to emerge in areas like the U.K. but there are other areas in Europe that are still in lockdown. I would expect that Europe and Brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year. And they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. But I would tell you, I'm very pleased with the decisions we've made around driving more promotion, and I'm pleased with the execution of this. This team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want. But I think it is sustainable going forward."

And then sort of on a related question, I hate to harp on the JAK question. But obviously, there's a lot coming to ask from what this impact might be. So if you look confined to the 15-milligram dose, not because of any signal, but because of the regulators' view of the safety of the class, how much impact would that have on the $8 billion long-term guidance? And do you have other levers that you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause?"

Second, on having a presumption of anti competitive behavior in terms of assessment of large scale, in particular, M&A meaning that it would impact future business development for the industry. So that's the first question. And then the second question, rather more positive, in terms of the JAK, when I look at consensus, the forecast for InvoCare about $6 billion.

Is it conceivable to you short of this drug effectively or the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market that, that GBP 6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimate for what this drug could do."

Clearly, I've accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the committee on May 18. We certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market. It's a highly competitive market where Humira competes. And certainly, as we look at the patents that were issued for Humira. They went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. They represent true innovation to the product. They were challenged by competitors, just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don't believe it's valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survive that challenge. And what I'd say is when we look at our behavior in this market, I think our behavior was absolutely pro competitive. We have patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio. And yet, we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired. So I feel highly confident in the position that we have taken in this marketplace that we have operated totally appropriately. And then your next question on RINVOQ -- I'm sorry.

So we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market. We see the IBD market, which with both assets, we think, is underappreciated. I mean even expansions in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy. And so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here. And just to comment on atopic derm, this is an explosive market. I mean is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration. So it's going to grow substantially. And even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business, the growth of the second line, that's not to say that we're not going to be very competitive in frontline. It's a very, very attractive space.

And in terms of the acute market, as I mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as I highlighted. If you look at the mix between UBRELVY and Nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it's very close. I mean, we typically run it a 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis. I think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that's taking place there. And I clearly don't have full insight into the Biohaven call through. But we've been quite disciplined. We have over 90% commercial access. So we're quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective. And our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning, but also the right type of profitability over time. So we're encouraged with our continued momentum with Hubei. In terms of atogepant, I think what's quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have. And I think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral. So we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset. And we think that, frankly, you need to take care of the migraine. And atogepant, will be very well positioned to do that. We also think that we'll have nice synergies. Obviously, we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting UBRELVY to both neurologists and then high-prescribing general practitioners. And it will fit in very well as we put atogepant into that sales sleeve. So we're set up well, we think, for our go to market."

And unfortunately, it means for the patient. So I'll give you a little bit of the numbers. So typically, the CLL market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level, like 2% every year. If you look at the impact from COVID, we can see almost 3 different ways. We can see a way where the new patient starts in the market were down in the high teens in the first part, okay? Then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down, and then it got hit again into the teens in the August period, and we saw it down again in early January, about 18%.

With respect to why IMBRUVICA is being hit harder than other anticancer agents in the pandemic. I think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression of CLL. So CLL, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival. In the short term, there's a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary, because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example, certainly much slower than AML. Another indication that we are very active in, in the hem/onc space. And so I think in the setting of the pandemic, that's why you are seeing more deferrals for start of therapy and, in some cases, longer time to switch of therapy, which would explain why IMBRUVICA dynamics are different than other anticancer agents that treat other diseases."

With respect to negative symptoms and the treatment of those negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it's a very challenging area. It's a very important area because they're responsible for much of the long-term loss of function in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. It has been a very difficult area to approach in general, and we believe Vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact in the disease. But it's also one that's been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the U.S. It's been a very difficult claim to get in the U.S. So it's not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label.

I mean, as you said, it's certainly early in the process, and we obviously know what's being proposed, but we don't necessarily know where we will end up. I think 1 of the important things that we need to continue to think through is, if we go back to -- one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed, was to make sure that 2 things happen: one, that U.S.-based companies were competitive for their foreign competitors; and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the United States. And I can certainly talk about the AbbVie example. I mean, I think it's pretty compelling when you sit back and look at we were able to go out and acquire an Irish company redomicile back to the United States. AbbVie today has 24,000 jobs in the United States. We've also increased investments significantly in the U.S. since tax reform the last 3 years, we've invested $1.5 billion. We committed that we would do $2.5 billion over time for the we exceed that commitment. We've added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. So companies like ours, it clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive. And certainly, in the acquisition of a company like Allergan. I think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the U.S. So I think going forward, one of the things that's important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don't go back to where we were and that is where U.S. companies aren't as competitive against their foreign competitors. The current proposal would make the U.S. have the highest rate of all developed countries. I'm not sure that's the position you'd want to be in. So hopefully, as we go forward, there'll be a balance that's looked at in raising taxes. But also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the U.S."

So we are -- we're actually not hearing physicians from our intelligence from our field teams actively thinking to switch patients from XELJANZ to RINVOQ. I mean that's a big decision for a physician what we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a XELJANZ issue. Typically, what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts. But we don't see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching. So that's basically our intelligence on your first question. In terms of your second question, we will not be using the Aesthetic sales force. We will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we've taken place for RINVOQ and atopic dermatitis. I think, as you know, that in terms of our reputation amongst the medical derms is extremely strong. We have the #1 reputation because of the years of Humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and HS. And obviously, we have a very, very strong impression and launch from SKYRIZI. So we basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade. And existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building -- we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our SKYRIZI teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists. An important fact is that basically, the overlap of those dermatologists that drives basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market. So we feel we're well positioned in terms of how we set up our go-to-market approach with this segment."

And so I think that is generally the range that we're talking about. I think when 1 talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy, but it's safety and it's the totality of the data. Obviously, it's extremely early for for our ROR game at agent, but we think it is a molecule because it impacts very well understood biology with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety that we can get in a range that's very competitive there. So I think we'd be looking for that Humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space within oral, obviously, coupled with a strong safety profile."

I mean, I think the way we approach the markets that we operate in as we look for areas where there are significant unmet need, and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. Sometimes it's drug only in fact, I'd say, the majority of our historical experience as AbbVie has been it was a drug only. But as an example, 951 is a good example of where it's a combination product, right, a device and a drug. Certainly, as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the Allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options that are available for physicians and patients. So I'd say we tend to go at it and we're certainly not opposed to devices being part of it. If they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in standard of care. In Aesthetics, as Rob indicated a moment ago, we're looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body. And I would say, in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role. And so that's an area where I think you'll see us embrace even device only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. So it's an area that we, historically, many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life. But I'd say also the teams in the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need."

And what we saw is during COVID, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700. That was the midyear. And then it's consistently come back up. So towards the end of March, we've started to hit or recover that pre-COVID historical rate. So progress is there. And ultimately, the way we see these markets functions. As you recover your MBRX momentum the TRxs will start to come. So we're encouraged on the latest trends, but your point is right. It has been a little bit soft on the market. And certainly, as a brand, VRAYLAR drop because of COVID, but is now really fully recovered and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. So hopefully, that helps."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our first quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. We're off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. 
Total adjusted net revenues of $12.9 billion was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. These results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics as well as high single-digit operational growth from hematological oncology.
Additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. Skyrizi and Rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. Imbruvica and Venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Vraylar, which remains one of the fastest-growing medicines in psychiatry, delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis. And within our leading aesthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-COVID levels, Botox Cosmetics and Juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. Both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. 
The integration of Allergan also continues to go very well. As illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. While the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. We see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in March, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-COVID levels, including CLL and HCV in particular. 
We expect the increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a full recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. Based on a robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. And we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. 
I'm also extremely pleased with our R&D prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, especially within our late-stage pipeline. We're on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next 2 years, including 5 total expected approvals in 2021. This includes atogepant, a novel oral CGRP for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio; a new eye drop with the treatment of presbyopia; as well as expanded indications for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. 
And we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for advanced Parkinson's disease, Skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, Vraylar for major depressive disorder, and additional indications for Imbruvica and Venclexta. With these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long-term outlook remains very strong. 
In closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. I'm pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. We're off to another excellent start in 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?"

We demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. Our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. Humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. 
Our new immunology agents, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth, well above all comparable launches. Skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. This is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. Skyrizi total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to Humira. 
Additionally, we recently received approval for a single dose prefilled pen for Skyrizi, which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. Skyrizi is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience. Rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. Physician and patient feedback remain very positive on Rinvoq's level of efficacy, speed of response and strong benefit-risk profile. 
Internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access and share. Skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the EU5 psoriasis market, exceeding Tremfya and Cosentyx and at parity with Taltz. As Mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases, with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. 
In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. Imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter, with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. Imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. 
Venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis, with increasing share in frontline CLL and continued strong performance in AML. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. 
Within migraine, the launch of Ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations, with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. Feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy's efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is the #1 branded acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. 
The oral CGRP therapies, including our leading Ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. We believe there's substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. We also look forward to the expected commercial approval of atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine, later this year. Botox Therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications, with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis.
Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas. We saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. Mavyret sales were $415 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels. And we also saw double-digit comparable growth from Linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or chronic idiopathic constipation. 
Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on track to deliver a very strong revenue growth in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

I'll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with Rinvoq and Skyrizi in new disease areas as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs.
We recently reported positive top line results from the second induction study for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. Similar to results from the first induction study, in this Phase III trial, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. The 45-milligram induction dose was well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previous Rinvoq studies. 
In these induction trials, we saw no DVT, PE, MACE events or malignancies in the Rinvoq groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. We believe these induction data compare very favorably to other UC treatments on the market or in development. And based on the data generated to date, Rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We expect to see results from the UC maintenance study this summer, with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year.
The Rinvoq programming Crohn's disease is also progressing very well. And we expect to see induction data from the first of 2 Phase III trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second Phase III trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. 
We're also nearing completion of our pivotal program for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease. Earlier this year, we reported positive results from the 2 Crohn's induction studies, and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. Our regulatory submissions for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. Following completion of our registrational program for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022. 
We're very pleased with the level of activity we saw with Skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our Phase III program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis.
Our regulatory submissions are currently under review for Rinvoq in 3 new indications in the U.S., ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis. As we previously announced, the FDA recently extended the review period for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis, following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for Rinvoq in these indications. In response to the FDA request, we provided updated data from across Rinvoq programs in RA, psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in June and for atopic dermatitis in July. The regulatory action date for Rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for June. We remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of Rinvoq across all indications, and we'll work with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. 
Earlier this year, we received European approval for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and AS. Our European regulatory application for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review, and we remain on track for a CHMP opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter.
We also recently saw results from a 4-week Phase Ib study, evaluating our novel small molecule RORgamma t inverse agonist, ABBV-157 in patients with psoriasis. By targeting RORgamma t with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit IL-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. In our Phase Ib study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger Phase IIb dose-ranging study in the second half of this year. 
Moving now to our oncology portfolio. We continue to make very good progress with our late-stage programs for Imbruvica, Venclexta and navitoclax as well as with our early-stage oncology assets. We remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations and phased transitions this year. At the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the Imbruvica plus Venclexta CAPTIVATE trial, fixed-duration cohort in treatment-naive CLL patients. 
The Imbruvica-Venclexta combination is an important element of our hem/onc strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. Data from our Imbruvica-Venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline CLL later this year.
We will also be presenting 4-year follow-up data from Venclexta's CLL 14 trial in frontline CLL as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a Phase Ib study evaluating Venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-naive, high-risk MDS patients. We expect this MDS study to complete in the second half of this year, and if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. 
In the area of solid tumors, at the recent AACR meeting, we presented Phase II results for Teliso-V in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Teliso-V demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed cMets, where we saw a 54% objective response rate. cMet is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where approximately 30% of patients have overexpressed cMet. Approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti cMet antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. In contrast, our cMet antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. 
We recently began the second stage of our Phase II study, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also plan to evaluate Teliso-V in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents as well as in other cMet positive tumor types.
We also have a next-generation cMet ADC program that will be entering the clinic later this year. Our new cMet ADC, ABBV-400 utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which we believe will provide greater antitumor efficacy against both amplified met and overexpressed cMet subtypes, thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti cMet targeting agents. 
In neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. A total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the Phase III ADVANCE study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well-tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset of action. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine, and an approval decision is expected in September of this year. 
We also presented results from an open-label Phase III study evaluating Ubrelvy in perimenstrual migraine, which showed that Ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment of migraine attacks that occurred during or near menstruation. Menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe and often resistant to treatment. 
And we presented data from a Phase I study demonstrating that ABBV-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent levodopa exposure to Duopa in advanced Parkinson's patients. Results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 are expected this summer, with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. We also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from 2 Phase III studies for Vraylar, an adjunctive major depressive disorder. And if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. 
In eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eye drop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. This new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. An approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. 
And in aesthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next-generation toxins and filler programs. By combining the aesthetic team's deep expertise,with AbbVie's breadth and scale of resources, we'll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. Looking across our portfolio, we've identified a number of programs to accelerate, including our short-acting and long-acting toxins as well as our next-generation biostimulatory tropoelastin and collagen fillers. Acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long-term growth for the aesthetics franchise. 
So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%.
As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.1% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. 
At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect international Humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion. And we now expect Botox Cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. 
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. 
Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. We have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. We continue to expect cumulative debt paydown of $17 billion by the end of 2021, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4x by the end of 2021 and approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year, with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

And then my second question was just a little bit more color on the aesthetic dynamics. I guess is there anything we're seeing with the results we're seeing, very, very strong here, is there any catch-up type event as the world reopens that we're seeing with these results? Or are these kind of sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations of that business?

I'll take the first question and then Rick will take the second question that you asked. With respect to Rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit-risk profile across indications and across the doses that we've studied. Having said that, both the 15- and 30-milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective. And so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response, and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms with 15 as well as with 30. And with the 15-milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in itch after only 2 days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. And again, that's really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. So we think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit-risk of both doses."

I'll cover the aesthetics one for you, as Mike said. I think if you look at the underlying performance of the Aesthetics business, in particular, the market growth in the U.S. and in China, it's driving the fundamental growth that we see to the business. Certainly, there is some impact still from COVID. So we're seeing some impact there. But I think the majority of it is, when we took over Allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in it prior. And they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach, where we have basically made a decision that we'll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level to drive demand because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. And I think the best comparisons are starting to look at what it looked like versus 2019 because you obviously have the COVID impact in 2020.
But you take, for example, Botox, Botox versus 2019, cosmetic Botox versus 2019, it's up about 27%. The market is growing very robustly. Some of that is probably COVID driven. These are U.S. numbers I'm describing right now. Some of that is probably COVID driven. But I wouldn't say a lot of it at this point is COVID driven in the U.S. China continues to grow very well. In fact, I'd say China is back to the level of growth. And we have expanded the sales force in China once about 4 or 5 months ago. We're in the process now of going through a second expansion in China. I would expect that China will continue to drive significant growth going forward.
The one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from COVID is the European market. We still see it starting -- we see it starting to emerge in areas like the U.K. but there are other areas in Europe that are still in lockdown. I would expect that Europe and Brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. But I would tell you, I'm very pleased with the decisions we've made around driving more promotion, and I'm pleased with the execution of this team. This team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want. But I think it is sustainable going forward."

So could you give us a sense of how much upside that portfolio has, given the trends that you're seeing? And then sort of on a related question, I hate to harp on the JAK question. But obviously, there's a lot coming to ask from what this impact might be. So if you look confined to the 15-milligram dose, not because of any signal, but because of the regulators' view of the safety of the class, how much impact would that have on the $8 billion long-term guidance? And do you have other levers that you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause?"

It's hit -- I mentioned 16% for the quarter, but now in the weeklies, it's 17 or above on just the penetration of that segment. And so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long range planning. Certainly, the availability of another oral CGRP, in this case, for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute. And to Rick's point, remember, we have the big anchor asset with Botox Therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraine. And we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraine. And this is actually, in some ways, not overlapping because we have a big injector base for Botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for atogepant. And so when you look basically really across the waterfront, leading acute agent, oral, very, very potent and active oral agent in the middle with episodic and then on the back end with Botox, it's a very nice portfolio for us to have will drive growth.
And as Rick mentioned, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive MDD, and that segment itself, when we do the market analysis, is about as large, the adjunctive MDD segment, as bipolar depression. And so this basically had the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long-range plans. So we're very encouraged over this set of assets."

There's not much bipartisan agreement in the U.S. over drug price reform, but there seems to be a lot when it comes to antitrust in relation to the pharmaceutical industry.

Second, on having a presumption of anticompetitive behavior in terms of assessments of large scale, in particular, M&A, meaning that it would impact future business development for the industry. So that's the first question.
And then the second question, rather more positive, in terms of the JAK, when I look at consensus, the forecast for Rinvoq are about $6 billion. When you look at the size of the opportunity in RA alone, let alone psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, you see in the other indications you have, is it conceivable to you, short of this drug effectively or the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market that, that GBP 6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimate for what this drug could do."

Clearly, I've accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the committee on May 18. We certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market. It's a highly competitive market where Humira competes. And certainly, as we look at the patents that were issued for Humira, they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. They represent true innovation to the product. They were challenged by competitors, just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don't believe it's valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survive that challenge.
And what I'd say is, when we look at our behavior in this market, I think our behavior was absolutely pro-competitive. We have patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio. And yet, we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired.

So we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market. We see the IBD market, which with both assets, we think, is underappreciated. I mean even expansions in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy. And so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here.
And just to comment on atopic derm, this is an explosive market. I mean it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration. So it's going to grow substantially.

And so we see that cascading over our long-range plans as well. So we are very, very bullish -- agree that consensus is conservative."

So first on Ubrelvy, you mentioned it looks like the class is doing very well and gaining share. It also looks like over the last few weeks or so, you've been gaining a little share within the class relative to Nurtec. So I'm just wondering if you can sort of share your perspective on what you think is driving that. Some of us thought it might be due to pricing and access, but based on our calculation, it looks like your gross to net is actually lower than what it is from the Biohaven side. So any perspective would be helpful.
And then on atogepant, maybe just a little more you could talk to your kind of go-to-market strategy, assuming approval in September, especially again, given Nurtec will likely have an indication for both treatment and prevention. Sort of how do you see kind of coming in with 2 separate drugs? Could be 2 co-pays to compete just a different sort of message relative to what -- a single drug. So just any perspective on how you'll continue with that would be helpful as well."

And in terms of the acute market, as I mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as I highlighted. If you look at the mix between Ubrelvy and Nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it's very close. I mean we typically run it 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis. I think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that's taking place there. And I clearly don't have full insight into the Biohaven call through. But we've been quite disciplined. We have over 90% commercial access. So we're quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective. And our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning, but also the right type of profitability over time. So we're encouraged with our continued momentum with Ubrelvy.
In terms of atogepant, I think what's quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have. And I think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative oversimple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral. So we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset. And we think that, frankly, you need to take care of the migraine. And atogepant will be very well positioned to do that.
We also think that we'll have nice synergies. Obviously, we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting Ubrelvy to both the neurologists and then high-prescribing general practitioners. And it will fit in very well as we put atogepant into that sales sleeve. So we're set up well, we think, for our go-to-market."

The largest impact has been, unfortunately, into the market. And unfortunately, it means for the patient. So I'll give you a little bit of the numbers. So typically, the CLL market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level, like 2% every year. If you look at the impact from COVID, we can see almost 3 different ways. We can see a way where the new patient starts in the market were down in the high teens in the first part, okay? Then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down, and then it got hit again into the teens in the August period, and we saw it down again in early January, about 18%.

I'll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to why Imbruvica is being hit harder than other anticancer agents in the pandemic, I think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression of CLL. So CLL, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term, there's a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example, certainly much slower than AML, another indication that we are very active in, in the hem/onc space. And so I think in the setting of the pandemic, that's why you are seeing more deferrals for start of therapy and, in some cases, longer time to switch of therapy, which would explain why Imbruvica dynamics are different than other anticancer agents that treat other diseases."

It has been a very difficult area to approach in general, and we believe Vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact in the disease. But it's also one that's been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the U.S. It's been a very difficult claim to get in the U.S. So it's not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label.

I mean, as you said, it's certainly early in the process, and we obviously know what's being proposed, but we don't necessarily know where we will end up. I think one of the important things that we need to continue to think through is, if we go back to -- one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that 2 things happen: one, that U.S.-based companies were competitive to their foreign competitors; and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the United States. And I can certainly talk about the AbbVie example. I mean I think it's pretty compelling when you sit back and look at we were able to go out and acquire an Irish company, redomicile it back to the United States. AbbVie today has 24,000 jobs in the United States.
We've also increased investments significantly in the U.S. since tax reform. The last 3 years, we've invested $1.5 billion. We committed that we would do $2.5 billion over time. We're going to exceed that commitment. We've added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. So companies like ours clearly took the benefit of tax reform, and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive, and certainly in the acquisition of a company like Allergan. I think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the U.S.
So I think going forward, one of the things that's important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don't go back to where we were, and that is where U.S. companies aren't as competitive against their foreign competitors. The current proposal would make the U.S. have the highest rate of all developed countries. I'm not sure that's the position you'd want to be in. So hopefully, as we go forward, there'll be a balance that's looked at in raising taxes, but also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the U.S."

I think if you look at our overall estimate of high single-digit growth on Aesthetics, it's not heavily reliant on a large number of new products. There will be new products that come in. They're probably closer towards the back end of the long-range plan. So they don't have a significant impact on that overall growth rate. So I think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive, highly competitive in this market. If we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market, and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher."

So just talk about how you go after that opportunity and how you're preparing for it given your clear level of excitement there?"

So we are -- we're actually not hearing physicians from our intelligence from our field teams actively thinking to switch patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq. I mean that's a big decision for a physician. What we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a Xeljanz issue. So typically, what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts. But we don't see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching. So that's basically our intelligence on your first question.
In terms of your second question, we will not be using the Aesthetics sales force. We will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we've taken place for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. I think, as you know, that in terms of our reputation amongst the medical derms is extremely strong. We have the #1 reputation because of the years of Humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and HS. And obviously, we have a very, very strong impression and launch from Skyrizi. So we basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade, and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building -- we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our Skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists. An important fact is that basically, the overlap of those dermatologists that drives basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market. So we feel we're well positioned in terms of how we set up our go-to-market approach with this segment."

With respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that clearly exceeded the threshold that existed in the past with Otezla.

And so I think that is generally the range that we're talking about. I think when one talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy, but its safety and at the totality of the data. Obviously, it's extremely early for our RORgamma t agent, but we think it is a molecule because it impacts very well understood biology with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety that we can get in a range that's very competitive there. So I think we'd be looking for that Humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space within oral, obviously, coupled with a strong safety profile."

I mean I think the way we approach the markets that we operate in is we look for areas where there are significant unmet need, and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. Sometimes it's drug-only. In fact, I'd say, the majority of our historical experience as AbbVie has been it was drug-only. But as an example, 951 is a good example of where it's a combination product, right, a device and a drug. Certainly, as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the Allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options that are available for physicians and patients. So I'd say we tend to go at it and we're certainly not opposed to devices being part of it if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in standard of care.
In Aesthetics, as Rob indicated a moment ago, we're looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body. And I would say, in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role. And so that's an area where I think you'll see us embrace even device only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. So it's an area that we, historically, many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life. But I'd say also the teams in the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need."

Is that weakness there, because we do see strength with Ubrelvy and with Botox Therapeutic? So just wondering if there's something going on specifically with Vraylar. Has the bipolar depression opportunity been tapped out for some reason? And what can you -- what do you -- what can you and need to do to accelerate growth for Vraylar with the existing indications? That's number one.
And number two, on Rinvoq, I think everyone understands the rates around DVT PE and MACE.

So before COVID hit right in the first quarter of last year, the new-to-brand or the NBRx for Vraylar was about 3,500 new-to-brand prescriptions a week. And what we saw is during COVID, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700. That was the midyear. And then it's consistently come back up. So towards the end of March, we've started to hit or recover that pre-COVID historical rate. So progress is there. And ultimately, the way we see these markets functions, as you recover your NBRx momentum, the TRxs will start to come. So we're encouraged on the latest trends, but your point is right. It has been a little bit soft on the market. And certainly, as a brand, Vraylar dropped because of COVID, but is now really fully recovered and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. So hopefully, that helps."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. 
AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. 
These results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. 
Looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic. In immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the room, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. 
In neuroscience, Vraylar is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, continues to exceed our expectations. 
Aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-COVID levels, exceeding our internal expectations. We're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and COVID-related pent-up demand. Rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium term. and we are raising our full year guidance once again for aesthetics. 
While the recovery across the AbbVie portfolio is going very well in aggregate in certain disease areas like CLL and HCV we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic. We expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. 
One of AbbVie's greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. Across AbbVie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace, and our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers where protocols and guidelines permit. I'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level. 
As an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the Allergan transaction and integration. We just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which I'd say has gone exceptionally well. We're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction with accretion performing above our original projections. 
But I'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring Allergan, with 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy Allergan's historical performance. Our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. 
Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. 
As you'll hear from Mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business. which has positioned us well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come.

I'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to have significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. Skyrizi global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally. In the U.S., Skyrizi continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at approximately 34%. Skyrizi total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to Humira. 
Internationally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including Canada, France and Japan. 
Rinvoq is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis. We continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on Rinvoq strong benefit risk profile. Internationally, Rinvoq access and share continue to ramp nicely in RA with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries. 
We are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of PSA and AS across several OUS countries. And we look forward to the approval and commercialization of Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion for both the 15- and 30-milligram doses. 
Humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis. 
In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. AbbVie maintains a strong leadership position in CLL with a combined portfolio including both Imbruvica and Venclexta, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. In the U.S., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in CLL, which remain below pre-COVID levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. 
Venclexta sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. We're particularly pleased with the performance in AML with robust share in the U.S. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the EU and Asia. 
In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum with Vraylar, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. Vraylar revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. 
And Ubrelvy once again delivered robust results. Sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations. Feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. 
Ubrelvy is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. We continue to believe there is substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. 
In migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine. We are very encouraged with the efficacy profile of atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo as well as the overall percentage of responder rates in patients. Now the launch of atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly. We remain on track for a U.S. regulatory decision in September. 
Botox Therapeutics continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, Botox Therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. 
Lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from Eye Care, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis, Mavyret sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre-COVID levels. 
And we also saw double-digit comparable operational revenue growth for both Creon and Linzess. 
So overall, I'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

In fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of Rinvoq resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in UC clinical studies. 
With the 30-milligram Rinvoq dose, 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and 68% achieved steroid-free remission. 
We are very pleased with how Rinvoq performed from a safety perspective as well. In this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events, including serious and severe events, were higher in the placebo group than in either Rinvoq dose group. Additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for MACE, VTE and malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer were comparable between Rinvoq group and placebo. 
These results provide further evidence that Rinvoq has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. 
We're also nearing completion of the Crohn's disease program for Rinvoq and expect to see data from the first Phase III induction study later this year. Results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. 
We also saw very impressive results from Skyrizi in the maintenance phase of our Crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360-milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. Importantly, when we look at the most stringent end points, we see strong separation between Skyrizi 360 milligrams and control, with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission and 29% for deep remission compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52. 
We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC and Skyrizi in Crohn's in the coming months. 
In the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In June, Rinvoq received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe, recommending both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This CHMP opinion puts us on track for European approval in August. When approved, atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for Rinvoq in Europe. 
Regarding our supplemental NDAs in the U.S., we recently announced that we were notified by the FDA that they would not need our PDUFA action dates for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and closing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis, which were in late June for psoriatic arthritis and AS and mid-July for atopic dermatitis. The agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance study, indicated that they -- indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. 
The FDA has not requested any additional safety analysis for Rinvoq since the PDUFA dates were missed. While there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile for Rinvoq across all indications, and we'll continue to work with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. 
In our early-stage immunology pipeline, we recently began 2 new trials for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate. We initiated a definitive dose-ranging study in patients with RA and also started our Phase II study in polymyalgia rheumatica. Later this year, we expect to begin the Phase II study for 154 in Crohn's disease. 
Also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating Ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. While this CD40 antagonist demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. As a result, we will not be advancing Ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis. 
In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, data were presented from the GLOW and CAPTIVATE studies, evaluating a fixed duration Imbruvica and Venclexta regimen in CLL patients. Results from these 2 studies demonstrated that the all-oral, fixed duration Imbruvica plus Venclexta regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extend progression-free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum of age and fitness status for CLL patients. 
We plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new fixed duration treatment option to CLL patients once approved. 
Earlier this month, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing Phase Ib study. We expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for Venclexta in MDS. 
Also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a Phase I study evaluating the BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, TNB-383B, in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort. Based on these promising results, we exercised our right to acquire TNB-383B from Teneobio. We expect the transaction to close in the coming months, and we'll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. 
This is a highly competitive area. But based on the data to date, we believe this BCMA CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best-in-class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma. 
We continue to make good progress with the navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized Phase III trials in both the frontline and relapsed/refractory setting as well as a single-arm Phase II study. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized Phase III data, together with the Phase II trial results. We expect the Phase III data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. 
In neuroscience, we recently completed the Phase II proof-of-concept studies for 2 assets, Elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. In their respective studies, either asset met the efficacy endpoints of the trial. And we will be discontinuing the development of Elezanumab in MS and 8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. 
Given the enormous unmet need in Alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease-modifying therapies, and we continue to pursue a range of approaches. We have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development. These include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease, such as our TREM2 and CD33 programs that are both in clinical development and programs that target pathologic through novel mechanism such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. 
Following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the U.S. there has been an increased focus on A beta directed programs. We have monitored this area closely over the last several years. And based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an A beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. 
We have profiled a number of A-beta antibodies preclinically, and we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. We expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. 
Also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed an interim analysis in the first of 2 Phase III studies were our subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy comparable to DUOPA after 6 months of treatment. 
The primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off-time and a 41% increase in normalized on-time without troublesome dyskinesia. Patients also benefited from 951 24-hour continuous levodopa-carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in morning off-time. 
Full data from the 6-month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Data from a second Phase III study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year or early next year. 
And lastly, in eye care, at the recent meeting for the American Society for Cataract and Refractive Surgery, we presented results from the Phase III GEMINI 1 study, evaluating our topical eye drop, AGN-190584, for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes and sustained vision improvements for up to 6 hours. 584 has the potential to be convenient, on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. 
So in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year. and we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion, up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. 
Net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion. 
Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions: We now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from Botox Cosmetic and approximately $1.4 billion from Juvederm. We now expect Restasis sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. 
For Ubrelvy, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. For women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million. And for Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. 
Looking at the P&L for 2021. We are now forecasting adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.7 million and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.9 million. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including Botox, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Eye Care. We have also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. And we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. We expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt pay-down by the end of this year with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4x by the end of 2021 and approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance, and we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

Because it seems like it's pretty much across the board from aesthetics to Vraylar, Ubrelvy. So is it around promotion efforts? Is it around sort of payer dynamics? What -- anything you could share would be helpful there. 
And then the second one on Imbruvica. I just want to confirm, I think you guys said that the new patient share across all indications now is 42%. So I just want to see you guys are in line with when you expect at this point. Obviously, there's been questions around some of the competitors that have entered the market. And maybe you can just talk about the patients who are not studying on Imbruvica? Sort of what are you seeing as the reasons why they might be choosing a competitor."

I'll cover a certain part of the first question, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that you might have. 
I think as you look at this business, one of the things that I think AbbVie is sort of known for is that we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way especially across what we consider to be growth range. We expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic and long-term basis but also from a short-term tactical basis. And I'll use aesthetics as the example. 
Early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention they needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. We did that globally. So if you look at Allergan in the past internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eye care and other therapeutic products. So we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of AbbVie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. 
And then in the U.S., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated R&D organization that's totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and it reports directly to Mike. And then the head of the business for aesthetics reports directly to me. And we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. 
So I think it's really 3 aspects of it from my perspective. It's one, the structure we put in place, and that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. Two, it's the disciplined processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses. And then third, I'd say we have consistently invested and we do invest in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. And certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in SG&A and we've increased the investment in R&D. 
Jeff, anything you'd add?"

I think a big piece is the level of the investment. So as we looked at the -- particularly the neuroscience compounds, Vraylar and Ubrelvy, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. So I think that all of these brands are spectacular brands, leadership position. And when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response. So nothing to add beyond that. 
Going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that I referred to was the combined AbbVie share. So that's Imbruvica plus Venclexta across all lines of CLL. So if you take a look -- if I give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total AbbVie share, which is made up around 24% for Imbruvica and 11% for Venclexta. 
For second-line share, for example, we have a 48% total AbbVie position, which is approximately 33% for Imbruvica and 15% for Venclexta. So both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across CLL. 
I'll give you some more thoughts as you asked for in terms of color in the market. Beyond that leadership level that we have across the CLL indication, we do see that the CLL market is still suppressed. So for example, patient starts year-to-date are down in the high single digits. And even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. We see that improving. And so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. 
In terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to Calquence within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their CLL ramp. But also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy CD20, which we think is also a COVID type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. 
So overall, the franchise is performing very, very well. And as you heard from Mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchises than before."

I think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. So we're very strong across the globe. And so when you think about the opportunities for us going forward, I think international certainly plays a big role as we leverage the Allergan business."

Just any color on that would be appreciated. 
My second question was Rinvoq in UC. Can you just help put some of this data into context as you think about the competitive landscape and particularly relative to what you had anticipated in your long-term guidance for this indication? I think you had about $1 billion in IBD sales by 2025. And if not, we've seen more of this data set. Just how comfortable are you feeling with that target and ultimately, the role Rinvoq is going to play in this space."

So it's a great question, and it's one that we have been looking at very carefully. I mean if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to try to drive the business. We believe this business is significantly underpenetrated. When you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration, it's tremendous. 
And so that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand. Globally, the aesthetics sales were up 31%. If you look at the U.S. toxin and filler business, the market is up about 40% versus 2019. 
So -- but it's hard to evaluate. I can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand, and we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. But we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was COVID related. And we look at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint and are now back at work. 
I'd say that study, if you looked at the data in that study, the conclusion that you would draw from that is very little of it is COVID related. Now I think the flaw is this. Most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. 
So I think to the best of our ability, what I would tell you is about 2/3 of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand and maybe 1/3 of it is pent-up demand. We're going to need a couple more quarters, I think, to see how that plays out. But I'd say that's our best assessment right now. So very robust growth either way but -- and it could sustain a little bit better than that. But I think you can pretty well count on 2/3 of it being fundamental demand that's sustainable longer term.

What I would say is the data that we have seen from Rinvoq UC has exceeded our expectations from an efficacy perspective. And the results there are very strong. UC has been very difficult to pharmacologically and getting high rates of remission and response has been challenging and both has delivered those results now across a number of studies. 
And I think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. I commented in my prepared remarks the fact that overall rates of AEs, serious AEs are actually lower than now the reason for that, that many of these are driven by and with an improvement in the disease, you do see them improve as well. 
And with respect to events and interest, the safety profile has looked very, very well and other interest rates have been comparable to controls. And so overall, we feel very confident in that. We just feel very confident a long-term guidance that we put out. One thing that's important to keep in mind is that long-term guidance is 2025 guidance. And our IBD assets will be in relatively early stages of launch by 2025.

With respect to 951, we'll publish full data from the Phase III study that I described at a medical meeting and then ultimately in peer-reviewed journals as well. But what I can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations, well within our expectations. As one would expect with the cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. We've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin. We feel good about the safety profile. And we think the patient-friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump-like device will be a real advantage here because it allow patients to get that DUOPA-like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's and very, very difficult to manage. And so we feel very good about the potential for 951. 
With respect to A beta, I think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit. And the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in the level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe, until you get to that amyloid negativity level by PET, which is -- until you reduce patients at that level. So the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible and to do that while minimizing the impacted area. And we think that, that can be done through epitope selection. 
There are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in vessel wall compared to plaque. And with appropriate epitope selection, we believe and our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of area. And of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data support that as well. 
But those are the basic principles that we're following. We've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval because, as I said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. But we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science I described plays out in the clinic. But our approaches with respect to A beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms."

This is somewhat of a novelty at least historically. I note that ESI excluded Calquence from their formulary. There's obviously increased therapeutic competition in the space. How should we be thinking about the rebating outlook in oncology going forward more broadly? 
Second, on the U.S. payer mix through COVID and now in the recovery stage, could you outline the magnitude of which you've had to increase and then decrease the Medicaid component and the patient assistance programs or whether you're seeing that improvement or some sense of scale and direction there?"

And to start with oncology, I mean, largely, as you know, the rebating has been done through the sort of the GPO channel. And particularly with the physician in-office dynamics that are in that sector. We don't see significant rebating happening at the PBM level. And if it is, it's quite modest. I think the -- certainly, from the ESI standpoint that you highlighted, that was an ESI decision. That was not certainly something that AbbVie approach the -- that particular payer with any sort of deal. 
Our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have basically open access for all of these agents. So I think it is something that we've seen some of these lights that have started to turn on, but they've been quite modest. And I don't think that they're going to be super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. That's my position on that. 
I think the second approach in terms of -- sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the Medicaid. Yes, this has been quite interesting. We've seen certainly on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in Medicaid has gone up. When we look across our businesses at, let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest. They're there. So we don't see massive movements around our channel shifting that linked to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. So it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. And I think, certainly, as we see the jobs positioned to come back and that could be quite strong, I think we'll see any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters."

The only thing I'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and I would say generous PAP program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases.

And so it's a program that I think is designed to fulfill the mission that I just described, and that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them whatever system that they operate in. And -- but we have not seen -- and much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increase dramatically even through COVID.

When we restructured the collaboration with Galapagos a few years ago to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator and C1 components of the regimen. We felt we had a best-in-class C1 in 22, 22, but we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand and we've done that. 
We also believe that we needed a C2 corrector that -- in that time period a few years ago did not exist. So we needed a C2 corrector that had the potential to be best-in-class. And so what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds. 119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. And based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best-in-class C2 corrector. And with the other components of our triple, we think we can deliver best-in-class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low DDIs, et cetera. 
And so we are now in a proof-of-concept Phase II study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will, in fact, bear out. What I would say here is the preclinical assays are good. They're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in CF, and we can study it in appropriate tissues in human tissues in vitro. 
But ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. By right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof-of-concept results for that triple. We'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year. Those will be data that will include impact on FEV1 with the triple. And so that will tell us whether we can be best-in-class. 
And I agree, if we are best-in-class, I think it's a very significant opportunity, and we would progress it rapidly. 
Now it's a proof-of-concept study. So if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. We're studying the highest dose of 119 to determine whether it can have that effect. We'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly. And then we would, if successful, move into Phase III development."

That's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. It's not a specific action date like the PDUFA dates that had been set in the past. So we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. 
But the rate limiting factor as we understand it, is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. And I think once that is completed, we would be able to move forward with good speed with our review. But there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us. We provided our updated benefit risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly, and the agency has not requested any additional data. 
So it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance it's gaining as we understand it. 
With respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. But what I would say is if they were planning on having an advisory committee, I would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion, and we would know that.

As I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with Ubrelvy and really, our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. To give you some sense, it's quite remarkable. I mean if you look at the total acute oral CGRP category, so that's us and the competitor, it's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. So again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are looking for the adoption of these particular agents even though you have to step through a triptan in some cases, 2 triptanes. So the market demand is very, very substantial. 
When we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the 2 agents are sort of splitting the acute indication. Some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from Nurtec. But nonetheless, I think that's a small piece of the story. When we sort of peel out some of their preventative, new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. But I really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time, and we anticipate that we'll continue to lead that based on Ubrelvy overall profile.
Our overall access dynamics are quite good. So we really have roughly a 90% access. Again, some of that access is -- demands a step through of triptan. But overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position. And so basically, our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine. So thank you."

And of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years, and they need really faster than that. So that's our focus on plaque. 
With respect to different components and the role of oligomers, I think it's hard to tease that apart right now. What we know from the data is what I said, that getting patients to amyloid negativity. So reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit. Whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result, I think, is an open question. And we're going where the science tells us to go today. 
With respect to IV or subcu, I think it's early to answer that question. It's going to relate to ultimately the delivered dose and then those forms that can be delivered. So for example, there are on-body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional 1 or 2 mL of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody. So there are approaches that could be IV or subcu, but I think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out."

You've guided the peak sales for both products in the early 2030s. There's been a lot of focus on near-term regulatory hurdles, particularly for Rinvoq, but there's also a lot that could happen competitively between now and then. 
So with that said, what do you view as the biggest potential longer-term competitive threats for both of those drugs, and particularly given the ongoing emergence and maturation of new drug modalities? And second, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions you've built into overall guidance relating to the Delta variant and whether that's changed at all the way you think about the second half recovery?"

And I would say, as we look at Rinvoq and Skyrizi and the clinical data that has been generated, it's certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. I don't see anything on the horizon that would make it in a time frame that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long-range planning process. 
So yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas. It's having the right kind of asset, the right kind of clinical performance and then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. 
And so the bottom line is I think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. As it relates to the Delta variant, I think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume. We don't assume dramatic changes in the U.S. or other major markets around the world from where we are today. We're not assuming major levels of what probably in certain markets either that are currently in lockdowns like Australia as an example. We're in many of the Asian markets outside of China and Singapore. 
So I think we've properly represented it. I think the health care system in the U.S. in particular, I think is the experience that we had last year, I think, tells us that the health care system can much better treat these patients. And we're not assuming that we see anything that would be significant in a shift in the U.S. from a lockdown standpoint."

As you've said, for atopic derm, we got the positive opinion from the CHMP for both the 15 and 30-milligram doses.

I think another point that I'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with PSA and AS. There's -- there appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint as countries like Germany start to introduce PSA and AS, the entire Rinvoq molecule starts to accelerate and move faster. And so again, given the last question I answered, we're anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra room indications there.

And what I would say is we found that the studies were very well designed. We were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. We looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population enrolled. So you look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can see if you're enrolling the right patient population. And we believe we were. 
All of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. And so we feel good about the design characteristics of that study, and we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes. But we did do that deep dive to be sure of that. As I said, what we found was, in fact, reassuring. 
With respect to the market opportunity, I'll just make a couple of comments, and I'll hand it off to Jeff for some more detail. But what I would say is depression, obviously, is a substantial indication and it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents. About 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy with frontline agents like SSRIs or SNRIs. And so there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy. And obviously, this is an adjunctive MDD indication. So that would be the population that we would be looking at. 
Jeff, do you want to comment in more detail on that?"

And what I would say about not the big depression market but the adjunctive MDD market that Mike spoke about, it's about the same size in terms of a prescription value to the bipolar segment. 
So adjunctive MDD, if the studies were to progress as we see is really gives us a chance to access a market that's equally sized to the one that we're competing in today. So it's quite attractive as we continue to look for the final readout of those trials."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. 
AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. 
These results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. 
Looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic. In immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the rheum, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications, with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. 
In neuroscience, VRAYLAR is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of UBRELVY, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, continues to exceed our expectations. 
Aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-COVID levels, exceeding our internal expectations. We're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and COVID-related pent-up demand. Rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium term. and we are raising our full year guidance once again for aesthetics. 
While the recovery across the AbbVie portfolio is going very well in aggregate, in certain disease areas like CLL and HCV, we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic. We expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. 
One of AbbVie's greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. Across AbbVie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace, and our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers where protocols and guidelines permit. I'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level. 
As an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the Allergan transaction and integration. We just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which I'd say has gone exceptionally well. We're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction with accretion performing above our original projections. 
But I'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring Allergan, with 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy Allergan's historical performance. Our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company, with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. 
Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. As you'll hear from Mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business, which has positioned us well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come.

I'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to have significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. 
SKYRIZI global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally. In the U.S., SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, at approximately 34%. SKYRIZI's total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to Humira. Internationally, SKYRIZI has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including Canada, France and Japan. 
RINVOQ is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis. We continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on RINVOQ's strong benefit risk profile. Internationally, RINVOQ access and share continue to ramp nicely in RA with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries. 
We are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of PsA and AS across several OUS countries. And we look forward to the approval and commercialization of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis later this year, following the recent CHMP positive opinion for both the 15- and 30-milligram doses. 
Humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis. 
In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. AbbVie maintains a strong leadership position in CLL with a combined portfolio, including both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. 
IMBRUVICA global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. In the U.S., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in CLL, which remain below pre-COVID levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including VENCLEXTA and other BTK inhibitors. 
VENCLEXTA sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. We're particularly pleased with the performance in AML, with robust share in the U.S. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the EU and Asia. 
In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum with VRAYLAR, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. VRAYLAR revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. 
And UBRELVY once again delivered robust results. Sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations. Feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting UBRELVY rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. UBRELVY is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. We continue to believe there is substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. 
In migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine. We are very encouraged with the efficacy profile of atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo as well as the overall percentage of responder rates in patients. Now the launch of atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly. We remain on track for a U.S. regulatory decision in September. 
BOTOX Therapeutic continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, BOTOX Therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. 
Lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis. MAVYRET sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre-COVID levels. And we also saw double-digit comparable operational revenue growth for both Creon and Linzess. 
So overall, I'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

I'll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline events in the quarter. 
In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we reported positive top line results from the Phase III maintenance studies for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease. 
In the RINVOQ UC maintenance study, both the 15- and 30-milligram doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 52. In the induction portion of the program, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease. And the results from this maintenance study demonstrate that patients continuing treatment with RINVOQ maintain high levels of clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement at the 1-year mark. In fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of RINVOQ resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in UC clinical studies. With the 30-milligram RINVOQ dose, 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and 68% achieved steroid-free remission. 
We are very pleased with how RINVOQ performed from a safety perspective as well. In this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events, including serious and severe events, were higher in the placebo group than in either RINVOQ dose group. Additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for MACE, VTE and malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, were comparable between RINVOQ group and placebo. These results provide further evidence that RINVOQ has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. 
We're also nearing completion of the Crohn's disease program for RINVOQ and expect to see data from the first Phase III induction study later this year. Results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. 
We also saw very impressive results from SKYRIZI in the maintenance phase of our Crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360-milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. Importantly, when we look at the most stringent endpoints, we see strong separation between SKYRIZI 360 milligrams and control with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission and 29% for deep remission compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52. 
We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in UC and SKYRIZI in Crohn's in the coming months. 
In the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In June, RINVOQ received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe, recommending both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This CHMP opinion puts us on track for European approval in August. When approved, atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for RINVOQ in Europe. 
Regarding our supplemental NDAs in the U.S., we recently announced that we were notified by the FDA that they would not meet our PDUFA action dates for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis, which were in late June for psoriatic arthritis and AS and mid-July for atopic dermatitis. The agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance study, indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. 
The FDA has not requested any additional safety analysis for RINVOQ since the PDUFA dates were missed. While there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile for RINVOQ across all indications, and we'll continue to work with the FDA to bring RINVOQ to market in these new disease areas. 
In our early-stage immunology pipeline, we recently began 2 new trials for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate. We initiated a definitive dose-ranging study in patients with RA and also started our Phase II study in polymyalgia rheumatica. Later this year, we expect to begin the Phase II study for 154 in Crohn's disease. 
Also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating Ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. While this CD40 antagonist demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. As a result, we will not be advancing Ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis. 
In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, data were presented from the GLOW and CAPTIVATE studies, evaluating a fixed-duration IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA regimen in CLL patients. Results from these 2 studies demonstrated that the all-oral, fixed-duration IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extend progression-free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum of age and fitness status for CLL patients. We plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new fixed-duration treatment option to CLL patients once approved. 
Earlier this month, we received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated high-risk MDS patients based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing Phase Ib study. We expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for VENCLEXTA in MDS. 
Also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a Phase I study evaluating the BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, TNB-383B, in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort. Based on these promising results, we exercised our right to acquire TNB-383B from Teneobio. We expect the transaction to close in the coming months, and we'll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. This is a highly competitive area. But based on the data to date, we believe this BCMA CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best-in-class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma. 
We continue to make good progress with the navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized Phase III trials in both the frontline and relapsed/refractory setting as well as a single-arm Phase II study. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized Phase III data, together with the Phase II trial results. We expect the Phase III data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. 
In neuroscience, we recently completed the Phase II proof-of-concept studies for 2 assets, Elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. In their respective studies, neither asset met the efficacy endpoints of the trial, and we will be discontinuing the development of Elezanumab in MS and 8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. 
Given the enormous unmet need in Alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease-modifying therapies, and we continue to pursue a range of approaches. We have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development. These include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease, such as our TREM2 and CD33 programs that are both in clinical development, and programs that target pathologic TAL through novel mechanisms, such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. 
Following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the U.S. there has been an increased focus on A beta directed programs. We have monitored this area closely over the last several years. And based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an A beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. We have profiled a number of A beta antibodies preclinically, and we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. We expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. 
Also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed an interim analysis in the first of 2 Phase III studies were our subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy comparable to DUOPA after 6 months of treatment. The primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off-time and a 41% increase in normalized on-time without troublesome dyskinesia. Patients also benefited from 951's 24-hour continuous levodopa/carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in morning off-time. Full data from the 6-month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Data from a second Phase III study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year or early next year. 
And lastly, in eye care, at the recent meeting for the American Society for Cataract and Refractive Surgery, we presented results from the Phase III GEMINI 1 study, evaluating our topical eye drop, AGN-190584, for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes and sustained vision improvements for up to 6 hours. 584 has the potential to be a convenient, on-demand solution for patients with mild-to-moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. 
So in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year, and we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

Starting with second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion, up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. 
As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion. 
Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from BOTOX Cosmetic and approximately $1.4 billion from JUVÃ‰DERM. We now expect RESTASIS sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. For UBRELVY, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. For women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million. And for MAVYRET, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. 
Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are now forecasting adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.7 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. 
Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including Botox, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY and eye care. We have also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. And we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. We expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt pay-down by the end of this year with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4x by the end of 2021 and approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance, and we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year.

Because it seems like it's pretty much across the board from aesthetics to VRAYLAR and UBRELVY. So is it around promotion efforts? Is it around sort of payer dynamics? What -- anything you could share would be helpful there. 
And then the second one on IMBRUVICA. I just want to confirm, I think you guys said that the new patient share across all indications now is 42%. So I just want to see you guys are in line with what you expect at this point. Obviously, there's been questions around some of the competitors that have entered the market.

I'll cover a certain part of the first question, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that he might have. I think as you look at this business, one of the things that I think AbbVie is sort of known for is that we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way, especially across what we consider to be growth franchises. We expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic and long-term basis but also from a short-term tactical basis. And I'll use aesthetics as the example. 
Early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention that it needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. We did that globally. So if you look at Allergan in the past, internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eye care and other therapeutic products. So we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of AbbVie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. And then in the U.S., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated R&D organization that's totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and reports directly to Mike. And then the head of the business for aesthetics reports directly to me. And we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. 
So I think it's really 3 aspects of it from my perspective. It's one, the structure we put in place, and that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. Two, it's the disciplined processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses. And then third, I'd say we have consistently invested, and we do invest, in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. And certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in SG&A and we've increased the investment in R&D. 
Jeff, anything you'd add?"

I think a big piece, Vamil, is the level of the investment.

I think a big piece, Vamil, is the level of the investment. So as we looked at particularly the neuroscience compounds, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution, and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. So I think that all of these brands are spectacular brands, leadership position. And when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response. So nothing to add beyond that. 
Going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that I referred to was the combined AbbVie share, so that's IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA across all lines of CLL. So if you take a look -- if I give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total AbbVie share, which is made up of around 24% for IMBRUVICA and 11% for VENCLEXTA. For second-line share, for example, we have a 48% total AbbVie position, which is approximately 33% for IMBRUVICA and 15% for VENCLEXTA. So both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across CLL. 
I'll give you some more thoughts, as you asked for, in terms of color in the market. Beyond that leadership level that we have across the CLL indication, we do see that the CLL market is still suppressed. So for example, patient starts year-to-date are down in the high single digits. And even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. We see that improving. And so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. 
In terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to Calquence, within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their CLL ramp. But also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy CD20, which we think is also a COVID type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. So overall, the franchise is performing very, very well. And as you heard from Mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchise as we move forward."

So we've been able to bring that focus in the level of investment. I think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. So we're very strong across the globe. And so when you think about the opportunities for us going forward, I think international certainly plays a big role as we leverage the Allergan business."

My second question was RINVOQ in UC.

So it's a great question, and it's one that we have been looking at very carefully. I mean if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to try to drive the business. We believe this business is significantly underpenetrated. When you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration, it's tremendous. And so that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand. Globally, the aesthetics sales were up 31%. If you look at the U.S. toxin and filler business, the market is up about 40% versus 2019. 
So -- but it's hard to evaluate. I can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand, and we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. But we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was COVID related. And we look at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint and are now back at work. I'd say that study, if you look at the data in that study, the conclusion that you would draw from that is very little of it is COVID-related. Now I think the flaw is this, most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. 
So I think to the best of our ability, what I would tell you is about 2/3 of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand and maybe 1/3 of it is pent-up demand. We're going to need a couple more quarters, I think, to see how that plays out. But I'd say that's our best assessment right now. So very robust growth either way but -- and it could sustain a little bit better than that. But I think you can pretty well count on 2/3 of it being fundamental demand that's sustainable longer term.

What I would say is the data that we have seen from RINVOQ UC has exceeded our expectations from an efficacy perspective. And the results there are very strong. UC has been very difficult to treat pharmacologically and getting high rates of remission and weak response has been challenging and RINVOQ has delivered those results now essentially across a number of studies. And I think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. I commented in my prepared remarks the fact that overall rates of AEs, serious AEs, are actually lower than RINVOQ arm. Now the reason for that, that many of these AEs are driven by -- and with an improvement in the disease, you do see them improve as well. 
And with respect to events and interest, the safety profile has looked very, very [ strong as well. With respect to AE and other events and interest, rates have been comparable to controls ]. And so overall, we feel very confident. We just feel very confident with our long-term guidance that we put out.

With respect to 951, we'll publish full data from the Phase III study that I described at a medical meeting and then, ultimately, in peer-reviewed journals as well. But what I can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations, well within our expectations. As one would expect with a cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. We've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin. We feel good about the safety profile. And we think the patient-friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump-like device will be a real advantage here because it allow patients to get that DUOPA-like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's inserted in the small bowel and very, very difficult to manage. And so we feel very good about the potential for 951. 
With respect to A beta, I think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit. And the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in the level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe, until you get to that amyloid negativity level by PET, which is 20 centiloids, until you reduce patients at that level. So the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible and to do that while minimizing the impacted area. And we think that, that can be done through epitope selection. 
There are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in the vessel wall compared to plaque. And with appropriate epitope selection, we believe -- and our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of ARIA. And of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data support that as well. But those are the basic principles that we're following. We've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval because, as I said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. But we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science I described plays out in the clinic. But our approaches with respect to A beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms."

This is somewhat of a novelty at least historically. I note that ESI excluded Calquence from their formulary. There's obviously increased therapeutic competition in the space. How should we be thinking about the rebating outlook in oncology going forward more broadly? Second, on the U.S. payer mix through COVID and now in the recovery stage, could you outline the magnitude of which you've had to increase and then decrease the Medicaid component in the patient assistance programs or whether you're seeing that improvement or some sense of scale and direction there?"

And to start with oncology, I mean largely, as you know, the rebating has been done through the sort of the GPO channel and particularly with the physician in-office dynamics that are in that sector. We don't see significant rebating happening at the PBM level. And if it is, it's quite modest. I think the -- certainly, from the ESI standpoint that you highlighted, that was an ESI decision. That was not certainly something that AbbVie approach particular payer with any sort of deal. Our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have, basically open access for all of these agents. So I think it is something that we've seen, some of these lights that have started to turn on, but they've been quite modest. And I don't think that they're going to be super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. That's my position on that. 
I think the second approach in terms of -- sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the Medicaid, yes. This has been quite interesting. We've seen certainly, on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in Medicaid has gone up. When we look across our businesses at, let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest. They're there. So we don't see massive movements around our channel shifting that linked to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. So it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. And I think, certainly, as we see the jobs positions come back, and that could be quite strong, I think we'll see -- any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters."

The only thing I'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and I would say generous PAP program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases. As an example, 99% of the applications we get for uninsured patients, we approve. We actually just increased the program to 600% of the federal poverty level across all of our brands. And so it's a program that I think is designed to fulfill the mission that I just described, and that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them through whatever system that they operate in. 
And -- but we have not seen -- much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increase dramatically even through COVID. And we advertise directly to patients that if they lost their jobs during COVID that we would provide our medicines to them. But I wouldn't say -- as I said, much to our surprise, we didn't see the volume go up dramatically."

When we restructured the collaboration with Galapagos a few years ago to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator and C1 components of the regimen. We felt we had a best-in-class C1 in 2222, but we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand, and we've done that. We also believe that we needed a C2 corrector that, in that time period, a few years ago, did not exist. So we needed a C2 corrector that had the potential to be best-in-class. 
And so what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds. 119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. And based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best-in-class C2 corrector. And with the other components of our triple, we think we can deliver best-in-class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low DDIs, et cetera. And so we are now in a proof-of-concept Phase II study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will, in fact, bear out. What I would say here is the preclinical assays are good. They're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in CF, and we can study it in appropriate tissues, in human tissues in vitro. But ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. 
By right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof-of-concept results for that triple. We'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year. Those will be data that will include impact on FEV1 with the triple. And so that will tell us whether we can be best-in-class. And I agree, if we are best-in-class, I think it's a very significant opportunity, and we would progress it rapidly. Now it's a proof-of-concept study. So if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. We're studying the highest dose of 119 to determine whether it can have that effect. We'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly. And then we would, if successful, move into Phase III development."

So with respect to JAK safety, we have indicated that we believe that an action is possible in the next few months. That's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. It's not a specific action date like the PDUFA date that had been set in the past. So we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. But the rate-limiting factor, as we understand it, is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. And I think once that is completed, we would be able to move forward with good speed with our review. But there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us. We provided our updated benefit/risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly, and the agency has not requested any additional data. So it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance is gating as we understand it. 
With respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. But what I would say is if they were planning on having an advisory committee, I would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion, and we would know that.

As I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with UBRELVY and really, our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. To give you some sense, it's quite remarkable. I mean if you look at the total acute oral CGRP category, so that's us and the competitor, it's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. So again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are looking for the adoption of these particular agents even though you have to step through a triptan in some cases, 2 triptans. So the market demand is very, very substantial. 
When we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the 2 agents are sort of splitting the acute indication. Some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from Nurtec. But nonetheless, I think that's a small piece of the story. When we sort of peel out some of their preventative, new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. But I really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time, and we anticipate that we'll continue to lead that based on UBRELVY's overall profile.
Our overall access dynamics are quite good. So we really have roughly a 90% access. Again, some of that access is -- demands a step through a triptan. But overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position. And so basically, our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine. So thank you."

But I think I heard you describe the product that you're targeting the plaques and not the soluble forms of A beta. Just kind of maybe if you -- wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the driver of going forward with that. Do you guys -- does your science sort of tell you that amyloid beta oligomers, for example, are not a driver of the disease? Or is this more of a decision that's driven by the regulatory precedence of approving -- targeting the A beta plaques? And then maybe also if you can give a little more detail on this molecule. Is it likely an IV or possibly subcu-delivered antibody?"

With respect to the focus on plaque, I think when one looks at all of the data, you can conclude that if you can reduce plaque rapidly, from that point forward, you can see a benefit. So in other words, getting the majority of patients to a level where they are amyloid negative by PET, so below 20 centiloids, and doing that rapidly is what's required to see a benefit emerge over time. And part of the importance of speed is that you're not going to see that benefit until you get to that level. So if you spend the entire period of a trial getting to that level, you don't then have an opportunity within that trial to see an improvement in cognition. And of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years, and they need really faster than that. So that's our focus on plaque. 
With respect to different components and the role of oligomers, I think it's hard to tease that apart right now. What we know from the data is what I said. They're getting patients to amyloid negativity. So reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit. Whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result, I think, is an open question. And we're going where the science tells us to go today. With respect to IV or subcu, I think it's early to answer that question. It's going to relate to, ultimately, the delivered dose and then dose forms that can be delivered. So for example, there are on-body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional 1 or 2 mLs of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody. So there are approaches that could be IV or subcu, but I think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out."

You've guided to peak sales for both products in the early 2030s. There's been a lot of focus on near-term regulatory hurdles, particularly for RINVOQ. But there's also a lot that could happen competitively between now and then. So with that said, what do you view as the biggest potential longer-term competitive threats for both of those drugs, and particularly given the ongoing emergence and maturation of new drug modalities? And second, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions you've built into overall guidance relating to the Delta variant and whether that's changed at all the way you think about the second half recovery?"

And I would say, as we look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI and the clinical data that has been generated, it's certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. I don't see anything on the horizon that would make it in a time frame that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long-range planning process. 
So yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas. It's having the right kind of asset, the right kind of clinical performance and then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. And so the bottom line is I think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. As it relates to the Delta variant, I think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume. We don't assume dramatic changes in the U.S. or other major markets around the world from where we are today. We're not assuming major levels of recovery in certain markets either that are currently in lockdowns, like Australia as an example, or in many of the Asian markets outside of China and Singapore. 
So I think we've properly represented it. I think the health care system in the U.S. in particular, I think is -- the experience that we had last year, I think, tells us that the health care system can much better treat these patients. And we're not assuming that we see anything that would be significant in a shift in the U.S. from a lockdown standpoint."

Why that is, I can't give you a single reason other than these are both very large, competent jurisdictions that have come to their own impressions of the data. And those impressions have differed somewhat. As you've said, for atopic derm, we got the positive opinion from the CHMP for both the 15- and 30-milligram doses.

I think another point that I'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with PSA and AS, there appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint. As countries like Germany start to introduce PSA and AS, the entire RINVOQ molecule starts to accelerate and move faster. And so again, given the last question I answered, we're anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra rheum indications there. So it's quite strong.

And what I would say is we found that the studies were very well designed. We were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. We looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population enrolled. So you look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can see if you're enrolling the right patient population. And we believe we were. All of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. And so we feel good about the design characteristics of that study, and we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes. But we did do that deep dive to be sure of that. As I said, what we found was, in fact, reassuring. 
With respect to the market opportunity, I'll just make a couple of comments, and I'll hand it off to Jeff for some more detail. But what I would say is depression, obviously, is a substantial indication. And it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents. About 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy, with frontline agents like SSRIs or SNRIs. And so there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy. And obviously, this is an adjunctive MDD indication. So that would be the population that we would be looking at. 
Jeff, do you want to comment in more detail on that?"

AbbVie continues to perform very well. We once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. Total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balanced growth across each of the major growth platforms. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have established very strong launch trajectories. These 2 assets are either approved, under regulatory review or in late-stage development across all of Humira's major indications, and we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to AbbVie's long-term growth. 
Aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. Our dedicated global Aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and pillars, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. Our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. We are once again raising our full year guidance for Aesthetics this quarter, and we view this portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade. 
Our Neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter and we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of Tulipta, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Our hematological oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter despite a protracted market recovery in CLL, which remains below pre-COVID levels. 
Beyond the significant contributions of IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. These include navitoclax for myelofibrosis, epicritumab for B-cell malignancies, ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for AML and MDS as well as Taliso-B for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of Allergan. Our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our momentum, and we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67 reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint. 
Additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we're announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. 
Since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. In summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. We've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential, giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.

We continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with immunology, where we remain well positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. Total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were more than $5.4 billion, up 5.2% on an operational basis with 10.1% revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. 
SKYRIZI is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. In the U.S., SKYRIZI's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36%, more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. 
SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to HUMIRA. Internationally, SKYRIZI continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. This compelling share performance will be further supported by 2 important near-term enhancements: the availability of more simple delivery forms for SKYRIZI as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis. 
First, we recently launched the new and convenient SKYRIZI single-dose 150-milligram self-injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. The market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes SKYRIZI the only quarterly dose brand that is available in a single self-injectable pen for patients. 
Second, we are preparing for the global launch of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis as we near approval decisions in both the U.S. and Europe. We received a CHMP positive opinion earlier this month with anticipated approval in Europe by year-end, and we continue to expect FDA approval early next year. The addition of this indication, once approved, will round out SKYRIZI's dermatology label and give patients with PSA access to a new compelling therapeutic option. 
We are also making excellent progress with SKYRIZI's development in Crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for U.S. regulatory review with commercialization expected next year. RINVOQ also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. Total in-play RA share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world. 
Internationally, RINVOQ share continues to ramp in RA and we are making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of PSA, AS and atopic dermatitis where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications. As many of you are aware, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ in early September. While we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field and we have not observed a significant impact to RINVOQ's utilization at this time. 
That said, should the updated label restrict use to TNF inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in RA. Based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of RA therapy. We do expect that RINVOQ will ultimately obtain higher share growth in the second line plus setting as most patients ultimately fail TNF therapies over time. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of RINVOQ and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to AbbVie's long-term growth. 
In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis. IMBRUVICA and Venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme indications, including CLL, where AbbVie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Global IMBRUVICA revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. 
In the U.S., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in CLL and as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. New patient starts in CLL remain below pre-COVID levels. and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. Venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong AML launch trajectory in the international markets. 
In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion, up 25% on an operational basis. I'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well. Total sales for all the therapeutic BOTOX uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. 
UBRELVY, our leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. Total sales of $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. Based on UBRELVY's competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that UBRELVY represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. 
And now we are just launching QLIpTa, the only oral CGRP specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. Early feedback from our physicians has been very positive, given [indiscernible] strong efficacy, safety and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. The launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022. [indiscernible] also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. 
Now we believe having 3 distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with BOTOX therapeutic, UBRELVY and [indiscernible] which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. Our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position that capture growth in this dynamic market. 
Turning to psychiatry. We also see robust performance with Vraylar, which remains the fastest-growing atypical antipsychotic. Total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar 1 disorder and bipolar depression. Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from Eye Care, which had revenues of $871 million, up 2.9% on an operational basis. MAVERIK sales were $426 million, up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels. And we saw double-digit growth operationally for both Creon and Lupron. 
So overall, I'm pleased with our continued execution across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across therapeutic areas.

I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across therapeutic areas. Following successful completion of the registrational programs for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respective indications. We saw very strong data for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI as induction and maintenance treatments in UC and Crohn's, respectively. And based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. We anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. 
Earlier this month, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III Select AXIS II program for RINVOQ and Axial SpA, which included data from 2 stand-alone studies. One for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics and another for patients with non-radiographic axial SpA. In the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, RINVOQ performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo. 
We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult-to-treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. These results will be added to our submission package for RINVOQ and AS, which is currently under review by the FDA. In the non-radiographic axial SpA study, RINVOQ also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well. 
RINVOQ's safety profile in these axial SpA trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of DVT, PE, MACE events or malignancies in either study. Based on the data generated in the Select Access program, we believe RINVOQ has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from axial spondyloarthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. 
As you're likely aware, in September, the FDA communicated that they will require new warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti-TNFs. We continue to work with the FDA regarding updated labeling language for the RA indication while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain confident in our submission packages for these 3 new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the RA label update. 
In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress advancing all stages of our pipeline. We're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for Venclexta. In our study in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include 6-month follow-up data for duration of response. Based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of 2022. And for an accelerated approval. 
We continue to make good progress with Venclexta in the CANOVA trial, which is evaluating Venclexta in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a T114 mutation. Venclexta has shown strong anti-myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and, if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. We expect the data readout from this event-driven trial next year. 
In our early- to mid-stage Hemon pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the epcoritamab Phase I/II studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. And we're evaluating epcitimab as both a monotherapy and in combinations. We expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year, and we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. 
We also recently began the dose escalation stage of the Phase Ib studies for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. And ABBV-383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody is currently in the expansion stage of its Phase I study in multiple myeloma patients. and we expect to begin registrational Phase III studies next year. 
Moving to neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. In September, we received FDA approval for QULIPTA, the only oral CGRP specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. We're very pleased with the label, which reflects QULIPTA's strong benefit risk profile and is supported by a robust clinical development program. 
In our registrational program, which evaluated QULIPTA in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with QULIPTA resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. And approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in migraine days. We think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. 
Our migraine portfolio now includes UBRELVY for acute treatment of migraine, QULIPTA for preventative treatment of episodic migraine and BOTOX for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. With this distinct portfolio, AbbVie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease. 
This morning, we announced top line results from 2 Phase III studies evaluating VRAYLAR as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. In the 301 study, the 1.5-milligram VRAYLAR dose met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total MADRS score compared to placebo at week 6 with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. In this study, the 3-milligram VRAYLAR dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal P value of approximately 0.073 at week 6. 
In the second Phase III trial, the 302 study, neither VRAYLAR dose met the primary endpoint of changing total moderate score at week 6, but both the 1.5 and 3-milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks 2 and 4, with nominal p-values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons. 
Additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational Phase IIb study, where VRAYLAR demonstrated efficacy in MDD when added to ongoing antidepressant treats. Based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for VRAYLAR as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. We plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. 
We also recently announced positive top line results from a Phase III study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system, ABBV-951 to oral levodopa carbidopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in on-time without troublesome dyskinesia as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral levodopa carbidopa. 
We're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. 
And in eye care. We announced a partnership with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize RGX-314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. RGX-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline and complements our Eye Care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. REGENXBIO recently presented initial data from 2 Phase II studies evaluating RGX-314 in wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy using in-office suprachoroidal delivery. 
While early, these results are encouraging with RGX-314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose and the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. Also in eye care, we continue to expect approval for Viti shortly, formerly known as AGN-190584 and for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. This once-daily eye drop was developed to help address the presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses and once approved, would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, who may not want to wear reading glasses. 
This has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months. We expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone-filled year for AbbVie as well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

As you have heard from Rick, Jeff and Mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. Our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business and support AbbVie's long-term financial outlook. 
Turning to third quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, up 17.7% compared to prior year and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. This includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.6% of sales. Net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. 
As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67, reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance continues to contemplate full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% and favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. 
Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect Aesthetics global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. We now expect international Humira sales of approximately $3.3 billion. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting slower recovery of the CLL market. For MAVYRET, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion, and we now expect organic expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $12 billion, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, 
Today, we announced an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. And we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3x by the end of 2021 and approximately 2x by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results. and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

SKYRIZI doing really well, but some overhangs for RINVOQ. Is that $15 billion still achievable? Do you think you're trending above that? Or do you have to make up a shortfall?"

If I look at SKYRIZI I would tell you that SKYRIZI's performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are and it's very close to passing Humira now, which in this short period of time is, frankly, a surprise, how quickly it has ran. So I think that's a very positive case. If I look at RINVOQ, actually, the in-play share looks very good. 
Now we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to do behind T&Fs that, that will have some impact on the frontline patients that we're capturing now. And so we will see that impact. Having said that, I would say that when I look at RINVOQ's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more towards second-line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or 2 later than this, where we would have driven that. 
We have very good data to be able to support that. The other thing I'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these 2 assets. We have AD, which is a very significant opportunity for us. We have PSA and is a very significant opportunity. But next year, we have the IBD indication, coming out. And I'd say there, when we gave the $15 million forecast, the performance that was in our TPP, or our target product profile, that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. And so I think that's a very significant opportunity for us and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. Having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. We want to see what the final label looks like from the agency. And then we'll be in a position, I think, to come out and until the investor community exactly what we think. The only other thing I'd say is I think if you go back 5, 6 years ago, what we were trying to accomplish with the company, we're basically trying to accomplish with the company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace Humira in the marketplace and be superior to Humira. These 2 assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. So I think everything I know about these 2 assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expected of them, even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect. 
Second thing is we built a significant hem/onc portfolio that when I look at the pipeline behind IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, I think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. And then with the Allergan acquisition, I couldn't be more pleased. And Aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing at an outstanding level. I think the migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive and eye care is another one. And so we now have multiple assets and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. And our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on. We expect to see the impact of the LOE on Humira in '23. And immediately be able to grow beyond that, starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point. And regardless of what happens with RINVOQ's label, I have a high level of confidence we can continue to do that. Rob, anything you'd add?"

And we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed. And again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. The psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings. We would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that RA decision for ankylosing spondylitis as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've rolled in a new study, which is a positive study and a very strong study in ankylosing spondylitis into that submission. And so that 1 might be on a slightly different time frame. But we remain very confident in that approval as well."

On BOTOX, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and act",569,"Chris, this is Rick. On BOTOX, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. And that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated totally dedicated Aesthetics organization because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the U.S., but in China as an example, you see very similar kinds of dynamics. And so focusing that team purely on Aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. The second one is, when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers. We believe that the business was being underfunded in a way both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. And so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result. And then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. And what you're actually seeing now, I think, is we are driving the market. We're bringing more patients into the category and obviously, because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint, we get the vast majority of those patients. Is there still some pent-up demand I would tell you, it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it, right? Because remember, those practices reopened in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. And so that's a long time to have pent-up demand. But it's impossible to tell 1 way or another. So I would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients. One of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. And so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. They don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or plus go into pillars as an example. So the data is very clear. If you look at the U.S. as an example, toxins and pillars are growing high 30% the market. We're growing at about the same rate. maybe a little bit lower on pillars, but about that rate on toxins. When we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. And so I think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. When we say across the decade high single digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rate, the business is getting bigger and bigger. So therefore, the percentage will come down a bit. But I'll tell you, I'm very optimistic about this in this market. And our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market that can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time. It's a very good business."

Do you think you'll retain favorable formulary positioning even with biosimilars? In which case you keep paying that rebate, but you also would have less volume loss? Or do you think it becomes disadvantaged on formulary, in which case you pull back those billions of dollars in rebates and that flows through to the bottom line. To me, I just wonder if your guidance on erosion is frankly too conservative or I should say, too aggressive because those rebate dynamics in the U.S. may make us a more durable market than ex U.S. where those rebate dynamics don't exist."

I'll take the first part of your question, and then Jeff will take the second part of your question. With respect to Vraylar MDD, in the study that you described, the 1.5-milligram dose medicine point and met it with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005, so 0-0-5- And that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. And then as you point out, in the 3-milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a p-value that was very small. The nominal p-value was 0.07 million if we round. So when you look at that overall study to our eye, it clearly shows an effect in MDD. Now the second Phase III study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends. And across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small, and many of them were lower than 0.05. And I'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies. Even with the classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some studies that read out positive in some studies that are negative. And so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. And it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago. That was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. Now that study looked at slightly different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration. It was the upper 2 of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. So we had 2 positive studies, and that's important. Because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive Phase III study. And is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive, and we feel comfortable that, that is the case here. 
And lastly, what I'd say is if you look at the precedent and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described are not at all uncommon. In fact, I think they're very common amongst approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive MDD like Rexulti. So overall, we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway and will stack up very nicely to competitors, and we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

If you think about the -- what Mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, I think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the VRAYLAR is very attractive, which is why it's the fast and growing agent. So the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall. And I think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy, a very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. So when you start to see the potential for an agent like VRAYLAR that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of media, mixed episodes and depression and then the adjunctive depression indication, if approved, it will be very attractive. So we anticipate a nice catalyst here and certainly a nice add to VRAYLAR's overall profile."

What we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of QULIPTA for prevention. We see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which as Mike has said before and I've said before, is on the very high end of preventative performance. So 60% of patients in our trials achieved a greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant. And almost 30% have a complete control, 100% decrease in their migraine days. So that's very compelling in terms of this QULIPTA power. Also, physicians like the simple everyday dosing once a day. And so things are are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. So we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridge prescriptions until our -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as I mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year.

So in terms of the source of business, we think that QULIPTA is going to source business from 2 primary areas.

In many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted wow, it looks like a very strong map in a single oral pill. So that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. I think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a calling on a substantial amount of high-prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of maps, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. And so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean towards the maps because of the injectable nature of those, et cetera.

If we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with subretinal delivery. Now that's an OR procedure, but it gives clear proof of concept for the approach and shows that we can get durable control and that component of the program is already in Phase III. And then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. So that is a delivery method that can be done in office. It's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection. And that is also showing very good promise. We're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which, quite frankly, is sooner than we expected to see them before that study. had started to deliver results. And the tolerability is very good. If one looks at the inflammation that is reported in the REGENX trials, it's very different in its nature and its severity than that that has been seen with other agents. It's principally anterior chamber or exclusively anterior chamber. There's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation. It is readily treated with topical steroids and generally resolves without any difficulty and, in fact, quite rapidly. And it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. Other approaches have required that. So these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront and are responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. And the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids given is they're just not felt to be needed given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed. So we're very confident with it. And again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. And we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program.

And I would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. And so as I mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all 3 of them. With respect to Vraylar, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in the space. They're very challenging. It is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. 
So these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to RLAR are 1 of the most commonly used agents in this space.

So having said that, immunology is always an area where we are scouring the landscape to look to for the best opportunities. So I wouldn't say it's changed our focus in any way or changed our approach. But we will continue to look for novel therapies that can raise the bar on the standard of care across a number of areas, the current indications where we are already playing and new indications that have fewer treatment options areas like lupus and scleroderma. So the RINVOQ situation has not changed that strategy in any way."

What is your take here and what is going AbbVie's position about this? 
And the second question is the last dress we've seen from D.C. regarding the infrastructure build does not include a reduction of out-of-pocket costs in Medicare. We're still hearing from context, this still might be the case that it is still included. If you can comment on this issue, do you expect it to be included and the impact it might have on AbbVie's business."

So I'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. What I would tell you is what I said before. I mean, we are highly confident in our position with this IP. This IP has been challenged multiple times. And we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail. So I think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but I don't -- I wouldn't give it a lot of merit. Second, on interchangeable Humira. As we discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, 1.5 years or so ago, we did assume at that point that there were going to be 2 interchangeable biosimilars. It does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. So I think it will have an impact, but it's consistent with what we had assumed. And so we've essentially taking that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you and the estimates that we provided you. On drug pricing in the U.S. Look, I would say it's a very fluid situation. It's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are. You are correct. If you look at the framework that came out yesterday, essentially talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated and he didn't talk about much else. So look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference or out-of-pocket costs for patients and making them lower for Medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time, a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. And as we've said before, we think industry could play a role in that as 1 of the participants. And we would hope that we will get back to that because I think we think that is the most fundamental issue is reducing the out-of-pocket cost for these patients."

What I would say about RINVOQ is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in September. So that's principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have. And in fact, all agents in immunology have some degree of this that treat similar conditions to RINVOQ. For example, the TNFs have some of the same, but not all of the same warnings. So updating that section of the label is part of our base case. And then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around TNF inadequate response forms our base case. And those are the 2 factors that we're considering. We would not anticipate any limit in duration of therapy, for example. And the question dosed principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file because we have just a single dose in the other files and the files that are in the rheumatology space. And we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. So it's really those 2 dimensions and how those translate into specific language in RA. And then, of course, how they translate to the other indications because TNFs are not the standard of care in all indications. They are not used in atopic dermatitis. So then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. Those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs. And again, we feel very confident in the files that we put forward and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. With respect to CF and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there or what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. Obviously, the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space is VERTEX, and so that's what we would be benchmarking ourselves against. I would say, at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages. But what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute FEV1 points. A small number of absolute FEV1 points might not sound much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease."

What I would say is the discussions around the RA label update and the new indications that are under review are going on simultaneously. And there is some level of interdependence. In other words, we need to understand where the RA label will land because some of those elements like the warning supercautions will translate over to the other indications because in the U.S., you get on label for the molecule, that applies across all of the indications. So there's some interdependency. That's why getting the RA label update resolved is a gating factor whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, I think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail. But we would expect the psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time frame after that label update. As I mentioned, we are adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is smallest of the 3 indications. And so that one might be on a slightly different time frame as the agency reviews those new data. With respect to the UC filing, the RA label update is not on critical path to file acceptance. What the agency looks at when they look at file acceptances have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file? Is it in an appropriate format that they can review? Are there any significant efficiencies. And of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted. So we would not, in any way, anticipate any challenges there. And the RA safety label update is not a gating factor for that file acceptance."

There's very strong efficacy. And the safety is within our expectations. It matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. What's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control Parkinson's disease through other measures and to have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease, for example, with orals or with other approaches. And so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context. With respect to treatment discontinuations, what I would say is the treatment discontinuation. The rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump-like devices used across a range of conditions. Most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases. And there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances. But again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. And keep in mind, this is a very, very large population, this advanced Parkinson's population only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how they can be delivered. We think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. With respect to hallucinations, we know that, that is on mechanism for levodopa and carbidopa and it's essentially evidence that we are delivering levodopa and carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods. And it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. And what I would point to is in the other direction, the oral group, the control group that got oral levodopa carbidopa, had more falls. And that to our eye shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data because we know falls are common in Parkinson's disease patients. So we need to keep that in mind and with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use. When we look at how this will impact our oil use, again, keep in mind that a very broad population, only a very small segment of which can access the kind of therapies that they need to control their disease. Therapies like [indiscernible] which is transformative, but takes a surgical gastric tube. It's actually threaded into the small bowel to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. So this is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy, and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world."

In terms of QULIPTA, look, we are off to a very good start. I can tell you that UBRELVY continues to run a pace that total oral CGRP market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions and it's still early, and that would be us and Nurtec in the acute segment. And at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with triptans or some other issues. So we still have clearly some runway to go. It's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the mAbs so far. They certainly tripled the market size how will both of these orals and particularly in oral like QULIPTA in terms of the market development run a pace. It's encouraging for sure, particularly if you have all 3 of these of these agents in the market and the investment behind it.

AbbVie continues to perform very well. We once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. Total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balanced growth across each of the major growth platforms. 
We continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have established very strong launch trajectories. These 2 assets are either approved, under regulatory review or in late-stage development across all of Humira's major indications, and we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to AbbVie's long-term growth. 
Aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. Our dedicated global Aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. Our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. We are once again raising our full year guidance for Aesthetics this quarter, and we view this portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade. 
Our Neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter, and we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of QULIPTA, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Our hematological oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter despite a protracted market recovery in CLL, which remains below pre-COVID levels. 
Beyond the significant contributions of IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. These include navitoclax for myelofibrosis, epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, [ ABBV-383 ] for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for AML and MDS, as well as Teliso-V for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 
Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of Allergan. Our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our momentum, and we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67, reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint. 
Additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we're announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. Since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. 
In summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. We've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential, giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?"

We continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with immunology, where we remain well positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. Total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were more than $5.4 billion, up 5.2% on an operational basis, with 10.1% revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. 
SKYRIZI is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. In the U.S., SKYRIZI's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36%, more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. 
SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to Humira. Internationally, SKYRIZI continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. This compelling share performance will be further supported by 2 important near-term enhancements: the availability of more simple delivery forms for SKYRIZI as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis. 
First, we recently launched the new and convenient SKYRIZI single-dose 150-milligram self-injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. The market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes SKYRIZI the only quarterly dose brand that is available in a single self-injectable pen for patients. 
Second, we are preparing for the global launch of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis as we near approval decisions in both the U.S. and Europe. We received a CHMP positive opinion earlier this month with anticipated approval in Europe by year-end, and we continue to expect FDA approval early next year. The addition of this indication, once approved, will round out SKYRIZI's dermatology label and give patients with PsA access to a new compelling therapeutic option. 
We are also making excellent progress with SKYRIZI's development in Crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for U.S. regulatory review with commercialization expected next year. 
RINVOQ also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. Total in-play RA share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world. 
Internationally, RINVOQ share continues to ramp in RA, and we are making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of PsA, AS and atopic dermatitis, where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications. 
As many of you are aware, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ,, in early September. While we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field, and we have not observed a significant impact to RINVOQ's utilization at this time. 
That said, should the updated label restrict use to TNF-inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in RA. 
Based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of RA therapy, we do expect that RINVOQ will ultimately obtain higher share growth in the second-line-plus setting as most patients ultimately fail TNF therapies over time. 
Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of RINVOQ and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to AbbVie's long-term growth. 
In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis. IMBRUVICA and Venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme indications, including CLL, where AbbVie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. 
Global IMBRUVICA revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. In the U.S., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in CLL as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. New patient starts in CLL remain below pre-COVID levels, and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. 
Venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong AML launch trajectory in the international markets. 
In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion, up 25% on an operational basis. I'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well. Total sales of $645 million for all the therapeutic BOTOX uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. 
UBRELVY, our leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. Total sales of $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. Based on UBRELVY's competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that UBRELVY represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. 
And now we are just launching QULIPTA, the only oral CGRP specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. Early feedback from our physicians has been very positive, given QULIPTA's strong efficacy, safety and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. The QULIPTA launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022 QULIPTA also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. 
Now we believe having 3 distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with BOTOX Therapeutic, UBRELVY and QULIPTA, which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. Our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position that capture growth in this dynamic market. 
Turning to psychiatry. We also see robust performance with VRAYLAR, which remains the fastest-growing atypical antipsychotic. Total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression. 
Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from Eye Care, which had revenues of $871 million, up 2.9% on an operational basis. MAVYRET sales were $426 million, up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels. And we saw double-digit growth operationally for both Creon and Lupron. 
So overall, I'm pleased with our continued execution across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"
141885706,1684344394,2418575,"AbbVie Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","AbbVie Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across therapeutic areas.

I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across therapeutic areas. Following successful completion of the registrational programs for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respective indications. We saw very strong data for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI as induction and maintenance treatments in UC and Crohn's, respectively. And based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. We anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. 
Earlier this month, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III SELECT-AXIS 2 program for RINVOQ and axial SpA, which included data from 2 stand-alone studies. One for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics and another for patients with non-radiographic axial SpA. 
In the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, RINVOQ performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo. 
We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult-to-treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. These results will be added to our submission package for RINVOQ and AS, which is currently under review by the FDA. In the non-radiographic axial SpA study, RINVOQ also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well. 
RINVOQ's safety profile in these axial SpA trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of DVT, PE, MACE events or malignancies in either study. Based on the data generated in the SELECT-AXIS program, we believe RINVOQ has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from axial spondyloarthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. 
As you're likely aware, in September, the FDA communicated that they will require new warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ, and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti-TNFs. We continue to work with the FDA regarding updated labeling language for the RA indication while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain confident in our submission packages for these 3 new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the RA label update. 
In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress, advancing all stages of our pipeline. We're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for Venclexta. In our study in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include 6-month follow-up data for duration of response. Based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of 2022 for an accelerated approval. 
We continue to make good progress with Venclexta in the CANOVA trial, which is evaluating Venclexta in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11 14) mutation. Venclexta has shown strong anti-myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and, if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. We expect the data readout from this event-driven trial next year. 
In our early- to mid-stage hem/onc pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the epcoritamab Phase I/II studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. And we're evaluating epcoritamab as both a monotherapy and in combinations. We expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year, and we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. 
We also recently began the dose escalation stage of the Phase Ib studies for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. And [ ABBV-383 ], our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, is currently in the expansion stage of its Phase I study in multiple myeloma patients, and we expect to begin registrational Phase III studies next year. 
Moving to neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. In September, we received FDA approval for QULIPTA, the only oral CGRP specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. We're very pleased with the label, which reflects QULIPTA's strong benefit risk profile and is supported by a robust clinical development program. 
In our registrational program, which evaluated QULIPTA in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with QULIPTA resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. And approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days. We think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. 
Our migraine portfolio now includes UBRELVY for acute treatment of migraine, QULIPTA for preventative treatment of episodic migraine and BOTOX for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. With this distinct portfolio, AbbVie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease. 
This morning, we announced top line results from 2 Phase III studies evaluating VRAYLAR as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. In the 301 study, the 1.5-milligram VRAYLAR dose met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total MADRS score compared to placebo at week 6 with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. In this study, the 3-milligram VRAYLAR dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal p-value of approximately 0.073 at week 6. 
In the second Phase III trial, the 302 study, neither VRAYLAR dose met the primary endpoint of changing total MADRS score at week 6, but both the 1.5 and 3-milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks 2 and 4, with nominal p-values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons. 
Additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational Phase IIb study, where VRAYLAR demonstrated efficacy in MDD when added to ongoing antidepressant treatments. Based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for VRAYLAR as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. We plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. 
We also recently announced positive top line results from a Phase III study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, ABBV-951 to oral levodopa/carbidopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in on-time without troublesome dyskinesia as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral levodopa/carbidopa. 
We're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. 
And in Eye Care, we announced a partnership with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize RGX-314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. RGX-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline and complements our Eye Care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. REGENXBIO recently presented initial data from 2 Phase II studies evaluating RGX-314 in wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy using in-office suprachoroidal delivery. 
While early, these results are encouraging, with RGX-314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose and the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. 
Also in Eye Care, we continue to expect approval for [ Veuty ] shortly, formerly known as AGN-190584, for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. This once-daily eye drop was developed to help address the presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses and, once approved, would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, who may not want to wear reading glasses. 
This has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization, and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months. We expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone-filled year for AbbVie as well. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

As you have heard from Rick, Jeff and Mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. Our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business and support AbbVie's long-term financial outlook. 
Turning to third quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, up 17.7% compared to prior year and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. This includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.6% of sales. Net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. 
As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67, reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance continues to contemplate full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. 
Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect Aesthetics' global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. We now expect international Humira sales of approximately $3.3 billion. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting slower recovery of the CLL market. For MAVYRET, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion, and we now expect Allergan expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. 
Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $12 billion, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook. 
Today, we announced an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. And we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3x by the end of 2021 and approximately 2x by the end of 2022. 
In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results, and our financial outlook remains very strong.

SKYRIZI doing really well, but some overhangs for RINVOQ. Is that $15 billion still achievable? Do you think you're trending above that? Or do you have to make up a shortfall?"

What I'd say is the following. If I look at SKYRIZI, I would tell you that SKYRIZI's performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are, and",628,"Yes. I mean, Geoffrey, this is Rick. It's a great question. What I'd say is the following. If I look at SKYRIZI, I would tell you that SKYRIZI's performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are, and it's very close to passing Humira now, which, in this short period of time is, frankly, a surprise, how quickly it has ran. So I think that's a very positive case. 
If I look at RINVOQ, actually, the in-play share looks very good. Now we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to do behind TNFs that, that will have some impact on the frontline patients the naive patients that we're capturing now. And so we will see that impact. 
Having said that, I would say that when I look at RINVOQ's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more towards second-line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or two later than this, where we would have driven that. We have very good data to be able to support that. 
The other thing I'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these 2 assets, we have AD, which is a very significant opportunity for us, we have PsA and -- is a very significant opportunity. But next year, we have the IBD indications that are coming out. And I'd say there, when we gave the $15 million forecast, the performance that was in our TPP, or our target product profile, that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. And so I think that's a very significant opportunity for us and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. 
Having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. We want to see what the final label looks like from the agency. And then we'll be in a position, I think, to come out and tell the investor community exactly what we think. The only other thing I'd say is -- I think if you go back 5, 6 years ago, what we were trying to accomplish with the company, we're basically trying to accomplish with the company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace Humira in the marketplace and be superior to Humira. These 2 assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. 
So I think everything I know about these 2 assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expected of them, even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect. 
Second thing is we built a significant hem/onc portfolio that when I look at the pipeline behind IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, I think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. And then with the Allergan acquisition, I couldn't be more pleased. And Aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing at an outstanding level. I think the migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive and Eye Care is another one. And so we now have multiple assets and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. 
And our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on. We expect to see the impact of the LoE on Humira in '23 and immediately be able to grow beyond that, starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point. And regardless of what happens with RINVOQ's label, I have a high level of confidence we can continue to do that. Rob, anything you'd add?"

I think it's important to understand the nuances behind that litigation. So in this first set of litigation, this first wave of litigation, we are basically applying 10 patents in Humira. And as you know, we have a very robust patent portfolio around Humira. But these 10 patents are both formulation patents and indication patents. Many of these patents were challenged through the IPR process and upheld by the patent office. So it gives you some idea of the strength of these patents. 
So the first thing I'd say to you is we have a high level of confidence that we will prevail in this litigation. There will be a second wave of litigation that occurs after that, which will bring into the portfolio the rest of the patents that we think Alvotech infringes. So there could be another phase of litigation that occurs after this one. But I can tell you, we're highly confident that we will prevail in this first set of litigation based on the strength of those patents.

The gating factor here is really getting to the specifics of the language around RA, which is a process that is well underway. And we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed. And again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. The psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings, we would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that RA decision for ankylosing spondylitis. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've rolled in a new study, which is a positive study and a very strong study in ankylosing spondylitis into that submission. And so that one might be on a slightly different time frame, but we remain very confident in that approval as well."

On BOTOX, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and act",568,"Chris, this is Rick. On BOTOX, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. And that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated, totally dedicated Aesthetics organization, because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the U.S., but in China as an example, you see very similar kinds of dynamics. And so focusing that team purely on Aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. 
The second was -- when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers, we believed that the business was being underfunded in a way, both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. And so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result. And then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. 
And what you're actually seeing now, I think, is we are driving the market. We're bringing more patients into the category and obviously because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint. We get the vast majority of those patients. Is there still some pent-up demand? I would tell you, it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it, right? Because remember, those practices reopened in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. So that's a long time to have pent-up demand. But it's impossible to tell one way or another. So I would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients. 
One of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. And so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. They don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or, plus, go into fillers as an example. 
So the data is very clear. If you look at the U.S. as an example, toxins and fillers are growing high 30% of market. We're growing at about the same rate, maybe a little bit lower on fillers, but about that rate on toxins. When we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. 
And so I think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. When we say across the decade high single digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rate, the business is getting bigger and bigger. So therefore, the percentage will come down a bit. But I'll tell you, I'm very optimistic about this in this market and our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market that can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time. It's a very good business."

Do you think you'll retain favorable formulary positioning even with biosimilars, in which case you keep paying that rebate, but you also would have less volume loss? Or do you think it becomes disadvantaged on formulary, in which case you pull back those billions of dollars in rebates and that flows through to the bottom line? To me, I just wonder if your guidance on erosion is frankly too conservative or, I should say, too aggressive because those rebate dynamics in the U.S. may make this a more durable market than ex U.S., where those rebate dynamics don't exist."

Obviously, we don't talk publicly about what our managed care strategy is, but what I would tell you is we're close enough now to that '23 time frame that you would expect us to be starting the work to ensure formulary access on all of our products, and certainly Humira is one of those, for 2023.

I'll take the first part of your question and then Jeff will take the second part of your question. 
With respect to VRAYLAR MDD in the study that you described, the 1.5-milligram dose [ MADRS ] point and met it with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005, so 0-0-5. And that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. 
And then as you point out, in the 3-milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a p-value that was very small. The nominal p-value was 0.073 if we round. So when you look at that overall study, to our eye it clearly shows an effect in MDD. 
Now the second Phase III study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends. And across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small, and many of them were lower than 0.05. And I'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies. Even with the classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some studies that read out positive and some studies that are negative. And so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. 
And it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago. That was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. Now that study looked at slightly different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration. It was the upper 2 of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. 
So we had 2 positive studies, and that's important. Because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive Phase III study and is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive. And we feel comfortable that, that is the case here. 
And lastly, what I'd say is if you look at the precedent and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described are not at all uncommon. In fact, I think they're very common amongst approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive MDD like Rexulti. So overall, we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway and will stack up very nicely to competitors, and we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."

If you think about the -- what Mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, I think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the VRAYLAR is very attractive, which is why it's the fastest growing agent. So the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall. 
And I think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy, a very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. So when you start to see the potential for an agent like VRAYLAR that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of mania, mixed episodes and depression, and then the adjunctive depression indication. If approved, it will be very attractive. So we anticipate a nice catalyst here and certainly a nice add to VRAYLAR's overall profile."

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have now, as of this quarter, a dedicated migraine sales force, which shows you how important we think that this franchise is and what we can do with this franchise. 
So we have an entire sales team out there that is launching QULIPTA and now also focused on UBRELVY. And the early feedback has been very strong. What we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of QULIPTA for prevention. We see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which, as Mike has said before and I've said before, is on the very high end of preventative performance. So 60% of patients in our trials achieved a greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant, and almost 30% have a complete control, 100% decrease in their migraine days. So that's very compelling in terms of this QULIPTA power. 
Also, physicians like the simple everyday dosing once a day. And so things are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. So we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridge prescriptions until our -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as I mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year. We should ramp similar to UBRELVY, where ultimately, as you remember, we achieved about a 90% access in the U.S. So quite good early feedback on the launch.

So in terms of the source of business, we think that QULIPTA is going to source business from 2 primary areas. First is the big headache specialists, the big neurologists, we think, absolutely from our research and feedback that you'll start to see an early trade-off of the injectable mAbs in favor of the orals and certainly in favor of QULIPTA. I think that this is viewed as very attractive. In many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted -- wow, it looks like a very strong mAb in a single oral pill. So that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. 
I think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a -- calling on a substantial amount of high-prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of mAbs, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. And so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean towards the mAbs because of the injectable nature of those, et cetera. So think we're going to have a good balance between those 2 sources of business, and that's quite attractive for us right now."

If we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with subretinal delivery. Now that's an [ OR ] procedure, but it gives clear proof-of-concept for the approach and shows that we can get durable control and that component of the program is already in Phase III. 
And then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. So that is a delivery method that can be done in-office. It's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection. And that is also showing very good promise. We're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which, quite frankly, is sooner than we expected to see them before that study had started to deliver results. And the tolerability is very good. If one looks at the inflammation that is reported in the [ Regenexx ] trials, it's very different in its nature and its severity than that has been seen with other agents. It's principally anterior chamber or exclusively anterior chamber. There's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation. It is readily treated with topical steroids and generally resolves without any difficulty and, in fact, quite rapidly. 
And it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. Other approaches have required that. So these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront and are responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. And the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids given is they're just not felt to be needed, given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed. 
So we're very confident with it. And again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. And we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program. And the views we've heard from them are supportive of what I just described."

Is the outcome unclear to AbbVie at this juncture? Or is the outcome obvious and in line with what the FDA had in its statement in September? So that's the first question. 
Second question, to my knowledge, VRAYLAR has shown superiority to placebo but not generics in MDD. So how would AbbVie establish it as a leading MDD agent given the presence of lower-cost alternatives. 
And then lastly, any thoughts on the Soliton acquisition relative to its closing."

With respect to your question specifically about the RA label, those discussions are productive as well. I would assume the base case is what they announced conceptually back in early September, but we are working through the specifics of how that translates into labeling language. And I would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. And so as I mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all 3 of them. 
With respect to VRAYLAR, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in the space. They're very challenging. It is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. So these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to VRAYLAR, our one of the most commonly used agents in this space. 
So we think the very strong data that we have from the study that we described and the fact that we have prior supportive evidence as well from the earlier study will position it very well to be competitive in that marketplace."

Then the two questions I have first are interchangeability for Humira. Do you think this will matter in the marketplace? We are hearing different things from the large payers. What is your take here and what is kind of AbbVie's position about this?

So I'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. What I would tell you is what I've said before. I mean, we are highly confident in our position with this IP. This IP has been challenged multiple times. And we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail. So I think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but I don't -- I wouldn't give it a lot of merit. 
Second, on interchangeable Humira. As we discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, certainly 1.5 years or so ago, we did assume at that point that there were going to be 2 interchangeable biosimilars. It does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. So I think it will have an impact, but it's consistent with what we had assumed. And so we've essentially taken that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you and the estimates that we provided you. 
On drug pricing in the U.S. Look, I would say it's a very fluid situation. It's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are. You are correct. If you look at the framework that came out yesterday, it essentially talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated and he didn't talk about much else. So look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference are our out-of-pocket costs for patients and making them lower for Medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time, a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. 
And as we've said before, we think industry could play a role in that as one of the participants. And we would hope that we will get back to that because I think we think that is the most fundamental issue, it is reducing the out-of-pocket cost for these patients."

What I would say about RINVOQ is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in September. So that's principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have. And in fact, all agents in immunology have some degree of this that treat similar conditions to RINVOQ. For example, the TNFs have some of the same, but not all of the same warnings. 
So updating that section of the label is part of our base case. And then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around TNF-inadequate response forms our base case. And those are the 2 factors that we're considering. We would not anticipate any limit in duration of therapy, for example. And the question dose principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file because we have just a single dose in the other files and the files that are in the rheumatology space. And we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. 
So it's really those 2 dimensions and how those translate into specific language in RA. And then, of course, how they translate to the other indications, because TNFs are not the standard of care in all indications. They are not used in atopic dermatitis. So then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. Those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs. And again, we feel very confident in the files that we put forward and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. 
With respect to CF and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there or what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. Obviously, the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space, is VERTEX, and so that's what we would be benchmarking ourselves against. 
I would say, at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages. But what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute FEV1 points. A small number of absolute FEV1 points might not sound like much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease."

So with respect to the ongoing reviews, what I would say is the discussions around the RA label update and the new indications that are under review are going on simultaneously. And there is some level of interdependence. In other words, we need to understand where the RA label will land because some of those elements, like the warnings and precautions, will translate over to the other indications, because in the U.S., you get one label for the molecule that applies across all of the indications. 
So there's some interdependency. That's why getting the RA label update resolved is a gating factor. Whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, I think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail, but we would expect the psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time frame after that label update. As I mentioned, we are adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is smallest of the 3 indications. And so that one might be on a slightly different time frame as the agency reviews those new data. 
With respect to the UC filing, the RA label update is not on critical path to file acceptance. What the agency looks at when they look at file acceptances, have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file? Is it in an appropriate format that they can review? Are there any significant deficiencies? And of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted. So we would not, in any way, anticipate any challenges there.

There's very strong efficacy. And the safety is within our expectations. It matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. What's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control Parkinson's disease through other measures and who have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease, for example, with orals or with other approaches. And so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context. 
With respect to treatment discontinuations, what I would say is the treatment discontinuations -- the rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump-like devices used across a range of conditions. Most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection-site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases. And there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances. 
But again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. And keep in mind, this is a very, very large population, this advanced Parkinson's population, only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how they can be delivered. We think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. 
With respect to hallucinations, we know that, that is on mechanism for levodopa and carbidopa, and it's essentially evidence that we are delivering levodopa and carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods. And it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. And what I would point to is in the other direction, the oral group, the control group that got oral levodopa and carbidopa, had more falls. And that, to our eye, shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data because we know falls are common in Parkinson's disease patients. So we need to keep that in mind, and with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use. 
When we look at how this will impact our oral use, again, keep in mind that it's a very broad population, only a very small segment of which can access the kind of therapies that they need to control their disease. Therapies like DUOPA, which is transformative but takes a surgical gastric tube. It's actually threaded into the small bowel to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. 
So this is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy, and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world."

And typically, those contracts can be multiyear contracts, maybe 2-year contracts. So really, that's sort of the season where we'll have, as Rob and Rick said, probably some more guidance over how things are shaping up for '23 and possibly '24, depending on the posture of the payers and how those things work out. So we're not quite there yet. I think that what I can say is we're quite confident based on the timing that I described in terms of general cycles, in terms of where we're going to be for our portfolio, certainly in '22. 
In terms of QULIPTA, look, we are off to a very good start. I can tell you that UBRELVY continues to run a pace that total oral CGRP market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions and it's still early, and that would be us and Nurtec in the acute segment. And at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with triptans or some other issues. So we still have clearly some runway to go. It's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the mAbs so far. They certainly tripled the market size, how will both of these orals and particularly an oral like QULIPTA in terms of the market development run a pace. It's encouraging for sure, particularly if you have all 3 of these agents in the market and the investment behind it. Right now, though, we feel quite comfortable with the $1 billion opportunity for both of the orals."
