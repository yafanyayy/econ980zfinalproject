As you all know, the housing and repair and remodel markets that LP serves continue to show remarkable resiliency despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and demand for our products has remained very strong. 
Q4 was another record for SmartSide as sales increased by 30% to $259 million and Siding EBITDA nearly doubled over year-over-year to $77 million. OSB prices remained exceptionally high throughout the quarter, resulting in $250 million in EBITDA for the OSB segment. 
All business segments continue to demonstrate outstanding cost control. As a result, LP ended 2020 of $2.8 billion in sales, $781 million in EBITDA, $660 million in operating cash flow and $4.31 in earnings per share. It was a very strong ending to a uniquely challenging year that leaves LP well positioned for continued growth. 
Two years ago, we introduced a strategic transformation plan for LP. That plan included a 3-year target of $165 million in cumulative EBITDA improvements from growth, operating efficiency and strategic sourcing. Today, I am proud to announce that we have exceeded this target a year ahead of schedule with $177 million in cumulative impact delivered in only 2 years. 
I want to stress that we measure these results using normalized OSB and raw material prices. So this achievement is not merely an artifact of unusually high OSB prices or favorable movements in the cost of logs or resins. Rather, it is a result of the incredible dedication, creativity and grit of our sales, operations, logistics and sourcing teams. 
Having achieved significantly greater efficiency, we will not only hold those gains, but raise the bar as we continue to drive our growth and value creation strategy. 
Today, to build on our progress and to accelerate LP's transformation, I am pleased to announce a series of interconnected strategic initiatives. First, in order to supply growing demand, we are announcing a 2-phase capacity expansion strategy for SmartSide. Phase 1 will be the conversion of our mill in Houlton, Maine from the production of laminated strand lumber and OSB to SmartSide. 
Houlton is ideally located for SmartSide production because of its access to an ample and sustainable Aspen wood basket and its proximity to the large and underpenetrated repair and remodel market along the East Coast of the United States. Houlton will add roughly 220 million square feet of SmartSide capacity with production beginning early in 2022. 
We hope to converting the SmartSide, we will cease LSL manufacturing there sometime this year, the change that has contributed to a broader reevaluation of our product portfolio. Due to the loss of LSL from our EWP portfolio, coupled with our inability to consistently earn the cost of capital in EWP, we have decided to evaluate strategic options for our remaining Engineered Wood Products business. 
Phase 2 of the Smartside capacity expansion strategy will be the conversion of our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan. Sagola is currently producing OSB and will continue to do so until it is converted to Smartside manufacturing. Although the precise timing is yet to be determined, demand for SmartSide continues to grow at historic rates. We will need to begin to work on the Sagola conversion soon after Siding production begins at Houlton. This will require OSB production at Sagola to cease sometime in mid- to late 2023. 
These 2 new facilities will add roughly 520 million square feet of additional SmartSide capacity and remove roughly 670 million feet of OSB capacity. There is still a long runway for further Siding growth after these conversions, several potential expansions of existing facilities as well as other conversion opportunities. 
In addition to serving our growing customer demand, these conversions will also position the mills for years of growth and improved stability, which will benefit Houlton's and Sagola's employees, their families and their broader communities. We are thrilled to welcome LP Houlton to the SmartSide family of mills and look forward to converting Sagola soon after. 
Finally, since we idled our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, we have kept the mill ready with the intention to reopen it when we were confident that sustainable market demand will be sufficient to absorb its capacity. The consensus for 2021 housing starts has climbed for the past several months and is now near $1.5 million. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, December starts were $1.6 million and permits were $1.7 million, suggesting continued strength in new residential construction. At these levels of starts with channel inventories extraordinarily thin, it is clear that our customers need additional volume. 
Looking further into the future, long-term demographic data and a structural undersupply of housing suggests continued tailwinds for demand. As a result, we have begun the process to restart production of OSB and Peace Valley. Our goal is for Peace Valley to become a low-cost leader in the industry. Our flexible and disciplined operating strategy remains unchanged. Restarting Peace Valley increases our ability to meet intense customer demand and will add to our strategic options for balancing OSB supply and demand with discipline, agility and efficiency. 
With this production tax shield and long lengths, Peace Valley will also help us reach our goals for Structural Solutions as a percentage of total volume. Since we have been keeping the mill ready for an eventual rate start, the cost to resume production should not exceed $12 million. We've begun the necessary engineering, capital and rehiring planning to support the rate start. 
Earliest expectation for a first press load is sometime in Q3, full production capacity about a year later. We will continue to monitor the housing outlook, OSB demand and channel inventories to gauge proper timing for the restore. 
As I said previously, continued siding growth will require more frequent mill conversions. As a result, as Peace Valley resumes full production is a low-cost leader, it enables our phased capacity expansion plans for SmartSide while maintaining our current OSB market share. 
Slide 7 of the accompanying presentation shows more detail on our phased and integrated capacity strategy. Blue and Orange lines show LP's expected OSB and SmartSide capacity over time in millions of square feet. Houlton Shutdown is converged in the SmartSide and its ramp-up to full capacity are shown as A, C and E on the graph. 
Peace Valley will begin production at Point B sometime after Houlton ceases making both LSL and OSB in preparation for conversion. Peace Valley should then reach full production a year later at Point B. 
Sagola, Michigan will be the next siding mill after Houlton. Sagola's conversion will add roughly 300 million square feet of SmartSide capacity and remove roughly 420 million square feet of OSB capacity. While the exact timing of Sagola's conversion to SmartSide is still to be determined, the graph illustrates initial SmartSide production in the second half of 2023, which is consistent with an annual demand growth rate of 11%. 
Timing for all these steps is based on the assumption that OSB demand and SmartSide growth continue that the capital projects are completed on schedule. Should demand slow, which we do not currently anticipate, any or all of these steps can be delayed with minimal costs. There is little room to significantly accelerate the conversion or the Peace Valley restore as both of these projects are already underway. The Sagola conversion, on the other hand, could be brought forward somewhat should demand growth accelerate. 
The plan, once fully implemented, will increase total SmartSide capacity by roughly 520 million square feet or a little over 30%. The net effect of Houlton and Sagola's conversion in a Peace Valley restart will increase LP's OSB capacity with less than 100 million feet. 
More importantly, each of these initiatives will accelerate LP's ongoing transformation, grow our portfolio of SmartSide and Structural Solutions and improve our operational agility as we meet increasing customer demand. 
2020 was a year of incredible hurdles that uniquely tested our ability to adapt and work together. However, I'm incredibly proud of how LP employees came together to not only survive but thrive as a company. 
In the face of diversity, LP delivered strong results. As we turn our attention to a new year, we are focused on meeting customer demand realty products. We are excited to share our plans to execute on multiple years SmartSide expansion project and restart Peace Valley's part of our discipline and agile approach to OSB operations. This acceleration of our growth and value creation strategy will build on LP's growing momentum as we transform into a Building Solutions leader. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Alan Haughie for more details on our financial results and an update on our capital allocation strategy."

Slide 8 shows summarized results for the quarter, which are very clean and straightforward. Net sales increased by 60% to $860 million, primarily due to 30% growth of SmartSide and $246 million of higher OSB prices. 
The resulting EBITDA of $328 million is 7x last year's result and translated nearly dollar-for-dollar to operating cash flow of $321 million with the benefit of $45 million in tax refunds. 
We further lowered our year-end share count to 106 million shares after spending $171 million in the quarter to buy back a little over 5 million shares. And with taxes as the only meaningful adjustment to net income, adjusted earnings per share was $2.01 compared to U.S. GAAP earnings per share of $2.34. 
Slide 9 is the same data for the full year and is much the same story, just with bigger numbers. Net sales increased by 21% to $2.8 billion and EBITDA increased to $781 million, which is 4x last year's results. We grew SmartSide revenue by 15% and $481 million of revenue and EBITDA from higher OSB prices and generated $659 million in operating cash flow. 
Capital spending of $77 million ended up being about half our original pre-COVID guidance for 2020. The vast majority of this $77 million was spent on sustaining maintenance, which typically runs in the $80 million to $100 million range per year. As a result, we ended the year with $535 million in cash after paying $65 million in dividends and $200 million to repurchase shares. 
Slide 10 adds detail to the EBITDA impact from growth and efficiency through LP's ongoing strategic transformation. As Brad said, we exceeded our 3-year target of $165 million in cumulative EBITDA impact a year early with $107 million of growth and $71 million from efficiency. And this is a result of truly remarkable performance by our sales, operations and sourcing teams, especially given the challenges of 2020. But this is a race with no finish line. So we intend to hold these gains and add to them in 2021 and beyond. 
Slide 11 shows an ultra-high level roll forward of revenue and EBITDA for the fourth quarter compared to 2019. The main takeaway here is that higher OSB prices and 30% SmartSide growth tell us all we need to know about the quarter, everything else basically nets to 0. 
Having said that and while not shown here, our South America segment had a record quarter with $50 million of sales and $13 million of EBITDA, representing increases of 32% and 62% respectively even after adverse currency movements. 
The waterfalls on Slides 12 and 13 detail the year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter. Slide 12 covers Siding. In broad strokes, the 30% revenue growth for the quarter reflects a 95% increase in retail revenue and a 20% increase in distribution revenue. With an incremental margin of $0.51 on each additional dollar of revenue, this $59 million of SmartSide growth produced $30 million of additional EBITDA. With lower SG&A and higher OEE, more than offsetting the discontinuation of fiber, the Siding segment EBITDA margin increased by 12 percentage points to 30%. 
I should mention here that 2021 will be a year of increased investment in both selling and marketing and preventative maintenance to support future growth. So this margin is probably something of a high watermark. However, given the operating leverage and pricing power inherent in the business, we are raising our long-term target for the siding EBITDA margin by 5 percentage points to 25%. 
On Slide 13, very high market demand for OSB pushed prices to record levels, adding $246 million of revenue and EBITDA in the quarter, which rather overshadows both the continued excellence of our cost control and the growth of Structural Solutions, which rose to 49% of total OSB volume. We are, therefore, raising our long-term target for Structural Solutions volume as a percentage of total OSB volume by 5 percentage points to 55%. 
However, during the fourth quarter, we experienced interruptions in the supply chain for MDI with the primary residues in the manufacture of SmartSide, OSB and LSL. These issues were triggered by the impact of severe weather on MDI manufacturers in the U.S. Gulf Coast area. 
While MDI supply remains constrained, we are prioritizing MDI to SmartSide, substituting alternate phenolic resins for OSB and curtailing LSL production until availability improves. The use of phenolic resins in OSB lowers line speeds, which we estimate lost us $8 million of potential revenue and $3 million of potential EBITDA in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14 and some commentary on 2021. As you might expect, given our capacity and growth plans, this will be a year of investment. The Houlton conversion will cost about the same as the Dawson conversion in 2018, that is about $130 million. Roughly $80 million to $85 million of that $130 million will be spent in 2021 with the remainder in 2022. 
We have other strategic growth projects totaling $30 million to $35 million that will enable us to accelerate our rollout of new products, and we have our typical base level of about $100 million in sustaining maintenance. 
And as Brad mentioned, the capital required for a Peace Valley restart, which should be around $10 million at most. As a result, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range $220 million to $230 million. 
A word now about capital allocation. Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to return to shareholders who leased 50% of cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures required to execute our strategy once that cash has been generated. 
So given that we ended the year with $535 million in cash with a $300 million share buyback authorization from our Board, we will be reentering the market to continue buying back shares in a matter of days. 
Now I concluded my comments last quarter by saying that absent unexpected reversals in demand or the general housing outlook, the fourth quarter would look a lot like the third. Given accelerating SmartSide growth and rebounding OSB prices, that tend out to be a bit conservative. 
But we have similar visibility into our today. So I can share the following: halfway through this first quarter of 2021, OSB prices are at least 15% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 on similar volumes; SmartSide revenue is trending seasonally higher than the fourth quarter on pace for at least 35% growth compared to the first quarter of 2020; should these trends continue and absent COVID outbreaks or sudden reversals in logistics, raw material availability or OSB prices, we expect EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 to be at least $380 million. 
And with that, we will be happy to take your questions."

So that is what really got us focusing in on Houlton. 
And then also we do net present values of these conversions. And to a certain extent, Houlton was more optimal for us because of the LSL capacity there, not for reducing the kind of returns that we see in our OSB mills. 
From a Sagola standpoint, great wood basket as well. We do like making siding in the central part of the country. It's pretty -- most of our mills are there, but that central location allows us to access the West Coast, the central part of the U.S. and the East pretty efficiently. And also, the press size for that mill is a good press size for Siding conversion. 
I would say, from a capital standpoint, just look back at what we spent on Dawson and Swine, it's a very similar mill configuration to what we have in Sagola. And while we haven't made the decision on the finishing capability, we want to put into that plant because -- and that can impact capital cost, if you plan around the range of what cost us to convert Swan and Dawson, that would be good guidance for where we are right now."

So at the time -- 2 factors on the shutdown decision that are worth mentioning, first of all, at the time of the shutdown, the Western Canadian OSB pricing zone was one of the worst zones, if not the worst zone, for selling in OSB. There was a good bit of capacity added to that region over the last decade or so. 
And so we were looking at really low pricing there. And then candidly, we have struggled from a cost management standpoint of that mill in the past. And so when we look at those 2 together, it was a rather -- I mean, it wasn't a slam dunk decision when we looked at our work on which mill to shut down, but it certainly became rather obvious over through the analysis to that's where we wanted to concentrate the shutdown. 
And also being one of our larger mills with a capacity of 100 million square feet, it was with significant reduction in volume. Now why are we confident for starting it up? Well, the pricing dynamics has changed across the various OSB regions, but also the $10 million in capital and the $12 million overall, we're planning to spend to restart the mill, is focused on some of the bottlenecks that we've experienced in that facility that had limited our ability to hit the cost position that we want to. 
With the scale of that mill, it should be, and it was originally designed to be one of the low-cost mills in the OSB industry, certainly within our network. And we're confident, given our experience with OEE across our other facilities, and I will -- a bit of a detail, but also our experience over the last couple of years in reducing the cost at Peace Valley sister mill, which is our Clark County, Alabama mill, we're in a position to get that mill to be a very low-cost producer in our network and overall with the OSB network. 
So we're starting this mill up with the expectation that we would run it for a long time. And as we look forward into the next downturn, we would look overall at our entire network and optimize accordingly, but our expectation is we can get Peace Valley to a really good cost position."

Certainly, we have enough headroom for this year's budget to hit it. But Ketan, the thing about that is that those additional tape lines, either at our existing, preexisting facilities or greenfield are relatively inexpensive and quick start-up type capital projects. And so I don't see -- ever see any issue with us being constrained on prefinished capacity as we move forward. 
Let me just add on to that question that given the fact that we will have Houlton making lap siding next year, we will have a decision to make on where to concentrate that northeast production for prefinished. We haven't decided on that yet. And that solution could include us continuing to do it in our North Carolina facility. But really focusing in on that as we go through the year and understanding optimal place to produce that will be important to us. 
Don't think of prefinished capacity as being from certainly a financial constraint for us because it's pretty easy to add on lines at our existing facilities and they all have the space where we can do that pretty efficiently."

I appreciate all the thoughtful answers so far. On the siding conversion front, I mean, it doesn't sound like you guys have really seen any cost inflation for these conversion projects and a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison, but in the lumber industry, we have seen inflation for large-scale sawmill rebuilds. So I'm wondering on any context you can give there? And then you touched on your NPV analysis for these types of projects. And I'm curious if you can disclose how returns on the capital you're deploying to these conversions have trended? I assume it's positive, but any context you can give on how those returns have moved over time for these types of projects?"

There's a lot of moving parts within the project between",325,"Sure. Well, from the capital cost inflation, I mean, obviously, that is a factor in these rebuilds. But even though we kind of have found this range of conversion costs, it's been pretty consistent. There's a lot of moving parts within the project between the different facilities, what we have to do from a building standpoint or in the case of Houlton, we're part of this is a press rebuild that other 2 projects didn't require at time of conversion. And so we -- it's funny, we've kind of hit on this $120 million to $140 million that we've gotten there on each of the last 3 conversions from a different way. 
So I would say that, in some cases, that inflation has been offset by maybe less of a scope in the subsequent project, but it's not a material -- I don't want to say -- no, it's not a material issue that there's some component in these conversions that have just really escalated from an inflationary standpoint. 
From a return standpoint, these conversions have been great. When you -- for 2 reasons, one is our ability to continue to get pricing hasn't always been baked into all pro forma as aggressively have been able to get it. And then because of the strength of our siding growth, we've really filled these plants up really quickly from a utilization standpoint. And so they've been really good returns. I think those returns, there's evidence of that if you do ROIC on our Siding segment. It's really strong. So we like these conversions. 
And typically, as is the case with the 2 we announced today, we're converting rather high cost OSB mills. And then because of the scale of a mill likes to go, but it's going to be a really low-cost siding mill. So we get the kind of double taking up a high cost OSB mill and turn it into a high-return siding mill."

First is our ability to continue to get price improvement every year. Secondly, ROE initiative around Siding has been just outstandingly executed. So we're running the mills much more efficiently. And then thirdly, to the previous answer, we are converting -- adding mills to our network over the last 2 that have been relatively low-cost mills into the network. So once we get a mill like Dawson up and running, our overall cost profile for the network is lower by that. And -- well, and then a fourth part of that answer is that also has provided some logistics optimization around being present on the West Coast. So we get a logistics optimization or improvement as well. So it just comes from the investment pays off from a cost standpoint and then our ability to get pricing historically has both spread the margin for us very nicely."

As you all know, the housing and repair and remodel markets that LP serves continue to show remarkable resiliency despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and demand for our products has remained very strong.
Q4 was another record for SmartSide as sales increased by 30% to $259 million and Siding EBITDA nearly doubled over -- year-over-year to $77 million. OSB prices remained exceptionally high throughout the quarter, resulting in $250 million in EBITDA for the OSB segment.
All business segments continue to demonstrate outstanding cost control. As a result, LP ended 2020 with $2.8 billion in sales, $781 million in EBITDA, $660 million in operating cash flow and $4.31 in earnings per share. It was a very strong ending to a uniquely challenging year that leaves LP well positioned for continued growth.
Two years ago, we introduced a strategic transformation plan for LP that plan included a 3-year target of $165 million in cumulative EBITDA improvements from growth, operating efficiency and strategic sourcing. Today, I am proud to announce that we have exceeded this target a year ahead of schedule with $177 million in cumulative impact delivered in only 2 years.
I want to stress that we measure these results using normalized OSB and raw material prices. So this achievement is not merely an artifact of unusually high OSB prices or favorable movements in the cost of logs or resins. Rather, it is a result of the incredible dedication, creativity and grit of our sales, operations, logistics and sourcing teams. Having achieved significantly greater efficiency, we will not only hold those gains, but raise the bar as we continue to drive our growth and value creation strategy.
Today, to build on our progress and to accelerate LP's transformation, I am pleased to announce a series of interconnected strategic initiatives. First, in order to supply growing demand, we are announcing a 2-phase capacity expansion strategy for SmartSide. Phase 1 will be the conversion of our mill in Houlton, Maine from the production of laminated strand lumber and OSB to SmartSide. Houlton is ideally located for SmartSide production because of its access to an ample and sustainable aspen wood basket and its proximity to the large and under penetrated repair and remodel market along the East Coast of the United States. Houlton will add roughly 220 million square feet of SmartSide capacity with production beginning early in 2022.
With hope to converting the SmartSide, we will cease LSL manufacturing there sometime this year. The change that has contributed to a broader reevaluation of our product portfolio. Due to the loss of LSL from our EWP portfolio, coupled with our inability to consistently earn the cost of capital in EWP, we have decided to evaluate strategic options for our remaining Engineered Wood Products business.
Phase 2 of the SmartSide capacity expansion strategy will be the conversion of our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan. Sagola is currently producing OSB and will continue to do so until it is converted to SmartSide manufacturing. Although the precise timing is yet to be determined, demand for SmartSide continues to grow at historic rates, we will need to begin to work on the Sagola conversion soon after Siding production begins at Houlton. This will require OSB production at Sagola to cease sometime in mid- to late-2023.
These 2 new facilities will add roughly 520 million square feet of additional SmartSide capacity and remove roughly 670 million feet (sic) [ square feet ] of OSB capacity. There is still a long runway for further Siding growth after these conversions, for several potential expansions of existing facilities as well as other conversion opportunities.
In addition to serving our growing customer demand, these conversions will also position the mills for years of growth and improved stability, which will benefit Houlton's and Sagola's employees, their families and their broader communities. We are thrilled to welcome LP Houlton to the SmartSide family of mills and look forward to converting Sagola soon after.
Finally, since we idled our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, we have kept the mill ready with the intention to reopen it when we're confident that sustainable market demand will be sufficient to absorb its capacity. The consensus for 2021 housing starts has climbed for the past several months and is now near $1.5 million.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, December starts were $1.6 million and permits were $1.7 million, suggesting continued strength in new residential construction. At these levels of starts with channel inventories extraordinarily thin, it is clear that our customers need additional volume.
Looking further into the future, long-term demographic data and a structural undersupply of housing suggests continued tailwinds for demand. As a result, we have begun the process to restart production of OSB at Peace Valley. Our goal is for Peace Valley to become a low-cost leader in the industry. Our flexible and disciplined operating strategy remains unchanged. Restarting Peace Valley increases our ability to meet intense customer demand and will add to our strategic options for balancing OSB supply and demand with discipline, agility and efficiency.
With this production of TechShield and long lengths, Peace Valley will also help us reach our goals for Structural Solutions as a percentage of total volume. Since we have been keeping the mill ready for an eventual restart, the cost to resume production should not exceed $12 million. We've begun the necessary engineering, capital and rehiring planning to support the restart.
The earliest expectation for a first press load is sometime in Q3, full production capacity about a year later. We will continue to monitor the housing outlook, OSB demand and channel inventories to gauge the proper timing for the restart.
As I said previously, continued Siding growth will require more frequent mill conversions. As a result, as Peace Valley resumes full production as a low-cost leader, it enables our phased capacity expansion plans for SmartSide while maintaining our current OSB market share.
Slide 7 of the accompanying presentation shows more detail on our phased and integrated capacity strategy. Blue and Orange lines show LP's expected OSB and SmartSide capacity over time in millions of square feet. Houlton shutdown is converged into SmartSide and its ramp-up to full capacity are shown as A, C and E on the graph.
Peace Valley will begin production at Point B sometime after Houlton  ceases making both LSL and OSB in preparation for conversion. Peace Valley should then reach full production a year later at Point B.
Sagola, Michigan will be the next siding mill after Houlton. Sagola's conversion will add roughly 300 million square feet of SmartSide capacity and remove roughly 420 million square feet of OSB capacity. While the exact timing of Sagola's conversion to SmartSide is still to be determined, the graph illustrates initial SmartSide production in the second half of 2023, which is consistent with an annual demand growth rate of 11%.
Timing for all these steps is based on the assumption that OSB demand and SmartSide growth continue that the capital projects are completed on schedule. Should demand slow, which we do not currently anticipate, any or all of these steps can be delayed with minimal costs. There is little room to significantly accelerate the Houlton conversion or the Peace Valley restart as both of these projects are already underway. The Sagola conversion, on the other hand, could be brought forward somewhat should demand growth accelerate.
The plan, once fully implemented, will increase total SmartSide capacity by roughly 520 million square feet or a little over 30%. The net effect of Houlton and Sagola's conversion and a Peace Valley restart will increase LP's OSB capacity with less than 100 million feet (sic) [ square feet ].
More importantly, each of these initiatives will accelerate LP's ongoing transformation, grow our portfolio of SmartSide and Structural Solutions and improve our operational agility as we meet increasing customer demand. 2020 was a year of incredible hurdles that uniquely tested our ability to adapt and work together. However, I'm incredibly proud of how LP employees came together to not only survive but thrive as a company.
In the face of adversity, LP delivered strong results. As we turn our attention to a new year, we are focused on meeting customer demand for LP products. We are excited to share our plans to execute on multiple years' SmartSide expansion project and restart Peace Valley's part of our discipline and agile approach to OSB operations. This acceleration of our growth and value creation strategy will build on LP's growing momentum as we transform into a building solutions leader.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Alan Haughie for more details on our financial results and an update on our capital allocation strategy."

And with taxes as the only meaningful adjustment to net income, adjusted earnings per share was $2.01 compared to U.S. GAAP earnings per share of $2.34.
Slide 9 is the same data for the full year and is much the same story, just with bigger numbers. Net sales increased by 21% to $2.8 billion and EBITDA increased to $781 million, which is 4x last year's results. We grew SmartSide revenue by 15% and $481 million of revenue and EBITDA from higher OSB prices and generated $659 million in operating cash flow.
Capital spending of $77 million ended up being about half our original pre-COVID guidance for 2020. The vast majority of this $77 million was spent on sustaining maintenance, which typically runs in the $80 million to $100 million range per year. As a result, we ended the year with $535 million in cash after paying $65 million in dividends and $200 million to repurchase shares.
Slide 10 adds detail to the EBITDA impact from growth and efficiency through LP's ongoing strategic transformation. As Brad said, we exceeded our 3-year target of $165 million in cumulative EBITDA impact a year early, with $107 million from growth and $71 million from efficiency. And this is a result of truly remarkable performance by our sales, operations and sourcing teams, especially given the challenges of 2020. But this is a race with no finish line. So we intend to hold these gains and add to them in 2021 and beyond.
Slide 11 shows an ultra-high level roll forward of revenue and EBITDA for the fourth quarter compared to 2019. The main takeaway here is that higher OSB prices and 30% SmartSide growth tell us all we need to know about the quarter, everything else basically nets to 0. Having said that and while not shown here, our South America segment had a record quarter with $50 million of sales and $13 million of EBITDA, representing increases of 32% and 62% respectively even after adverse currency movements.
The waterfalls on Slides 12 and 13 detail the year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter. Slide 12 covers Siding. In broad strokes, the 30% revenue growth for the quarter reflects a 95% increase in retail revenue and a 20% increase in distribution revenue. With an incremental margin of $0.51 on each additional dollar of revenue, this $59 million of SmartSide growth produced $30 million of additional EBITDA. With lower SG&A and higher OEE, more than offsetting the discontinuation of fiber, the Siding segment EBITDA margin increased by 12 percentage points to 30%.
I should mention here that 2021 will be a year of increased investment in both selling and marketing and preventative maintenance to support future growth. So this margin is probably something of a high watermark. However, given the operating leverage and pricing power inherent in the business, we are raising our long-term target for the Siding EBITDA margin by 5 percentage points to 25%.
On Slide 13, very high market demand for OSB pushed prices to record levels, adding $246 million of revenue and EBITDA in the quarter, which rather overshadows both the continued excellence of our cost control and the growth of Structural Solutions, which rose to 49% of total OSB volume. We are, therefore, raising our long-term target for Structural Solutions volume as a percentage of total OSB volume by 5 percentage points to 55%.
However, during the fourth quarter, we experienced interruptions in the supply chain for MDI, the primary resin used in the manufacture of SmartSide, OSB and LSL. These issues were triggered by the impact of severe weather on MDI manufacturers in the U.S. Gulf Coast area. While MDI supply remains constrained, we are prioritizing MDI to SmartSide, substituting alternate phenolic resins for OSB and curtailing LSL production until availability improves. The use of phenolic resins in OSB lowers line speeds, which we estimate lost us $8 million of potential revenue and $3 million of potential EBITDA in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 14 and some commentary on 2021. As you might expect, given our capacity and growth plans, this will be a year of investment. The Houlton conversion will cost about the same as the Dawson conversion in 2018, that is about $130 million. Roughly $80 million to $85 million of that $130 million will be spent in 2021 with the remainder in 2022.
We have other strategic growth projects totaling $30 million to $35 million that will enable us to accelerate our rollout of new products, and we have our typical base level of about $100 million in sustaining maintenance.
And as Brad mentioned, the capital required for a Peace Valley restart should be around $10 million at most. As a result, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range $220 million to $230 million.
A word now about capital allocation. Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to return to shareholders who leased 50% of cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures required to execute our strategy once that cash has been generated. So given that we ended the year with $535 million in cash with a $300 million share buyback authorization from our Board, we will be reentering the market to continue buying back shares in a matter of days.
Now I concluded my comments last quarter by saying that absent unexpected reversals in demand or the general housing outlook, the fourth quarter would look a lot like the third. Given accelerating SmartSide growth and rebounding OSB prices that tend out to be a bit conservative, but we have similar visibility into our order file today. So I can share the following. Halfway through this first quarter of 2021, OSB prices are at least 15% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 on similar volumes. SmartSide revenue is trending seasonally higher than the fourth quarter on pace for at least 35% growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. Should these trends continue and absent COVID outbreaks or sudden reversals in logistics, raw material availability or OSB prices, we expect EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 to be at least $380 million.
And with that, we will be happy to take your questions."

As we've mentioned on earlier calls, we are targeted, prepared remodel as a key focus area for growth in siding in that northern and mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. is a really strong repair and remodel for siding, very strong repair and remodel market. So that is what really got us focusing in on Houlton.
And then also, we do net present values of these conversions. And to a certain extent, Houlton was more optimal for us because of the LSL capacity there, not for reducing the kind of returns that we see in our OSB mills.
From a Sagola standpoint, great wood basket as well. We do like making siding in the central part of the country. It's pretty -- most of our mills are there, but that central location allows us to access the West Coast, the central part of the U.S. and the East pretty efficiently. And also, the press size for that mill is a good press size for Siding conversion.
I would say, from a capital standpoint, just look back at what we spent on Dawson and Swan, it's a very similar mill configuration to what we have in Sagola. And while we haven't made the decision on the finishing capability, we want to put into that plant because -- and that can impact capital cost, if you plan around the range of what cost us to convert Swan and Dawson that would be good guidance for where we are right now."

So at the time, 2 factors on the shutdown decision that are worth mentioning, first of all, at the time of the shutdown, the Western Canadian OSB pricing zone was one of the worst zones, if not the worst zone for selling an OSB. There was a good bit of capacity added to that region over the last decade or so. And so we were looking at really low pricing there. And then candidly, we have struggled from a cost management standpoint of that mill in the past. And so when we look at those 2 together, it was a rather -- I mean, it wasn't a slam dunk decision. When we looked at our network on which mill to shut down, but it certainly became rather obvious over through the analysis to that's where we wanted to concentrate the shutdown. And also being one of our larger mills with a capacity of 100 million square feet, it was with significant reduction in volume.
Now why are we confident for starting it up? Well, the pricing dynamics has changed across the various OSB regions, but also the $10 million in capital and the $12 million overall, we're planning to spend to restart the mill, is focused on some of the bottlenecks that we've experienced in that facility that had limited our ability to hit the cost position we want to. With the scale of that mill, it should be, and it was originally designed to be one of the low-cost mills in the OSB industry, certainly within our network. And we're confident, given our experience with OEE across our other facilities, and I will -- a bit of a detail, but also our experience over the last couple of years in reducing the cost at Peace Valley sister mill, which is our Clarke County, Alabama mill, we're in a position to get that mill to be a very low-cost producer in our network and overall with the OSB network.
So we're starting this mill up with the expectation that we would run it for a long time. And as we look forward into the next downturn, we would look overall at our entire network and optimize accordingly, but our expectation is we can get Peace Valley to a really good cost position."

We haven't decided on that yet. And that solution could include us continuing to do it in our North Carolina facility.

We would stay pretty tight until we could get the Sagola conversion."

But over the last couple of quarters, the retail business, as Alan reported, has really been, I mean, just unbelievably strong.
From a growth standpoint, we've done a really good job of getting shelf space there retaining it and then adding SKUs. So that's been very helpful. And then our shed business, after being really, really, really slow at the beginning of COVID, has really taken off. And so we're moving a lot of panel through distribution and get it into the shed manufacturer.
So I would say, lap and trim into new construction and R & R has been a little stronger than we would have expected. And then the panel products through retail and into shed has just been really, really strong."

I mean, what's really been really, really solid for us on the OSB side has been legacy flooring and FlameBlock has been really good. We've learned from the WeatherLogic experience, we really need to have a rounded portfolio of that product, which we rounded that out last year. So we feel really good about -- I mean, we had good growth in WeatherLogic last year, but somewhat constrained by us not having the full portfolio. We've remitted that, and we're really ready to rock and roll that product offering as we move into this year.
On the Siding side, there's been a lot of good products. When you're talking about smooth and prefinishes from a really small base, but the market acceptance of that and really the need as we push into R & R has made -- the growth of it really strong. And I foresee continued strong percentage growth in those products because of -- again, because of the smaller base. But the go from 0 to 5% penetration with expert finish, I'm calling that a win. And so it's -- so we back up and look forward, really to get the kind of double-digit growth that we talk about in Siding, we've got to continue to be really innovative.
Fortunately, our product is very adaptive to innovation. And so as we continue to build out the portfolio of repair and remodel type products, which, by the way, shake is one of those that I've mentioned earlier, and then really focusing in on getting competitive on the big builder side with a product that we're going to be launching this year, those are the kind of really targeted new products that can either fill an edge or provide a real platform for growth. And there's no insight to our innovation initiative here because that's how you get double-digit volume growth is through a big emphasis on new products.
So I just -- what I'm communicating is don't -- there's not an end game on new products on SmartSide. We've got to really continue to be innovative to hit these numbers, and we intend to be so."

But we are -- we do sell prefinished in the West, but we use an independent prefinished network there that we have relationships with.
Right now, we've made that decision because of just the geographic expanse of the West Coast has made it. That is the more logical step for us currently.  So our focus in the near term is on the East Coast with our footprint. And if you think about what I just described, that's why us understanding the best way to access that upper -- that northeastern segment is something we need to -- we're working on, but that's the current network.

I appreciate all the thoughtful answers so far. On the Siding conversion front, I mean, it doesn't sound like you guys have really seen any cost inflation for these conversion projects and a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison, but in the lumber industry, we have seen inflation for large-scale sawmill rebuilds. So I'm wondering on any context you can give there? And then you touched on your NPV analysis for these types of projects.

But even though we kind of have found this range of conversion costs, it's been pretty consistent. There's a lot of moving parts within the project between the different facilities, what we have to do from a building standpoint or in the case of Houlton, we're part of this as a press rebuild, other 2 projects didn't require at time of conversion. And so we -- it's funny, we've kind of hit on this $120 million to $140 million that we've gotten there on each of the last 3 conversions from a different way.
So I would say that, in some cases, that inflation has been offset by maybe less of a scope in the subsequent project, but it's not a material -- I don't want to say -- no, it's not a material issue that there's some component in these conversions that have just really escalated from an inflationary standpoint.
From a return standpoint, these conversions have been great. When you -- for 2 reasons, one is our ability to continue to get pricing hasn't always been baked into all pro forma as aggressively have been able to get it. And then because of the strength of our siding growth, we've really filled these plants up really quickly from a utilization standpoint. And so they've been really good returns. I think those returns, there's evidence of that if you do ROIC on our Siding segment. It's really strong. So we like these conversions.
And typically, as is the case with the 2 we announced today, we're converting rather high cost OSB mills. And then because of the scale of a mill likes to go, it's going to be a really low-cost siding mill. So we get the kind of double whammy of taking up a high-cost OSB mill and turn it into a high-return siding mill."

And then thirdly, to the previous answer, we are converting -- adding mills to our network over the last 2 that have been relatively low-cost mills into the network. So once we get a mill like Dawson up and running, our overall cost profile for the network is lower by that. And -- well, and then a fourth part of that answer is that also has provided some logistics optimization around being present on the West Coast. So we get a logistics optimization or improvement as well. So it just comes from -- the investment pays off from a cost standpoint and then our ability to get pricing historically has both spread the margin for us very nicely."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the first quarter of 2021.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the first quarter of 2021. Robust customer demand for all of LP's products has continued, driven by ongoing strength in homebuilding and remodeling, resulting in an outstanding quarter for LP. 
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million. Smooth and ExpertFinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching 8% of total SmartSide volume. OSB prices continued to climb throughout Q1, with the result that LP's OSB segment generated extraordinary cash flow. 
LP's South American segment also had a very strong quarter, with 50% more sales and 3x more EBITDA than the first quarter of last year. As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records. 
Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan Society. Let me briefly update you on those projects. 
[indiscernible] conversion is underway and on schedule despite some expected difficulties with travel and contractor access presented by COVID. We expect to begin SmartSide production at Houlton less than a year from now in late Q1 of next year. We are excited about the capacity expansion of these investments in Houlton represent, and we are gratified by the enthusiastic responses from local and regional suppliers and community stakeholders. Given the strength of SmartSide demand, we are exploring options to accelerate the conversion of Sagola. We're also evaluating and prioritizing subsequent projects to add capacity by conversion and/or expansion of existing facilities as well as growing prefinishing capacity. SmartSide has a long runway for growth ahead as we innovate, capture share, expand addressable markets and execute an aggressive capacity expansion strategy. 
Process to resume OSB reduction in Peace Valley is also going quite well. I want to complement the small containment has maintained the mill since we idled it in the summer of 2019. They have kept the equipment in excellent condition, and we anticipate minimal impediments to an efficient restart. We're also pleased with a number of former employees who are returning to the mill, we're glad to welcome them back, and we look forward to resuming production in early Q3. 
Last quarter, I spoke about the challenges presented by shortages of MDI, the resident use and manufacture of SmartSide and OSB. MDI availability has improved significantly, and we are essentially back to normal levels of supply with a was being mills once again using planned levels of MDI. This episode has highlighted the strategic value of having Siding and OSB integrated in LP's portfolio. 
SmartSide uses MDI exclusively, but OSB can use alternate rests. When supply has become constrained, we were able to allocate scarce MDI from OSB to Siding. Without [indiscernible] Siding, we have struggled to achieve another outstanding quarter of growth. 
While the MDI supply has improved, a global shortage of vital asset tape-based adhesives has forced decreased production of TechShield, LP's Radiant Barrier sheeting product in the second quarter. The vinyl acetate supply situation is improving, and we expect to be back to normal levels of textile production by the end of the quarter. However, as COVID subsides in North America and the broader county rebounds a tremendous supply chain disruptions and type logistics availability are likely to present challenges going forward. We recognize the difficulties this creates rail pace customers, particularly in an environment with such strong demand. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of these issues through strategic sourcing and network optimization, and we are adding SmartSide and OSB capacity as safely, efficiently and quickly as possible. 
Finally, I'm happy to announce that LP is in the initial basis of returning to our national headquarters after more than a year of working from home. While we have a relieved and gratified to be slowly getting back to normal, I want to acknowledge it for the majority of LP's mill employees as well as many customers, working from home was not feasible. 
And while COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the U.S. and Chile, vacciantion rates continue to lag in Canada and Brazil. The situation is improving, but we are not out of the woods yet. Ongoing diligence in care exercised by LP's pandemic response team and mill employees are helping minimize operational impacts from COVID, enabling LP to supply our customers the products they need to build and renovate homes. I encourage all of them and all of you on the call to continue to exercise appropriate precautions and get vaccinated as soon as possible. 
LP had a remarkable first quarter. And while challenges remain, very strong housing in RNR markets resulting in intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, keeping our near-term outlook exceptionally positive. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for Q1 and outlook for Q2."
286119,711181954,2268446,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brad. Slide 6 shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers. Compared to the first quarter of last",1224,"Thanks, Brad. Slide 6 shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers. 
Compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by 74% to just over $1 billion, driven by 49% growth in SmartSide and over $330 million of significantly higher OSB prices. The resulting EBITDA of $461 million is more than 5x last year's result. We generated $314 million of operating cash flow, including increased capital investments and heavy spending on logs, common practice for LP in the first quarter. The $3.01 per share of adjusted earnings is 10x that in the first quarter last year. 
In terms of capital allocation, we paid $17 million in dividends in the first quarter and spent $122 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares. We've continued buying back shares through the second quarter and as of the close of business yesterday, had just $32 million remaining of our existing $300 million buyback authorization. All else equal, that remaining authorization will be exhausted by the end of this week. I'm therefore, delighted to report that LP's Board of Directors has authorized a further $1 billion of share repurchases, which we plan to launch immediately. LP's Board also declared a dividend of $0.16 per share payable on June 1. 
Slide 7 highlights the cleanliness of the quarter from a reporting perspective. Continued SmartSide growth and OSB price appreciation resulted in $93 million and $333 million, respectively, of incremental revenue for the quarter, compared to which everything else is really just a rounding error. All $333 million of the incremental OSB pricing and 55% of the incremental SmartSide revenue translated into EBITDA, with everything else aggregating to a net negative of $6 million. 
Slide 8 provides an update on our transformation. On a trailing 12-month basis, SmartSide revenue grew at twice the rate of single-family housing starts. Consequently, and as the table on the right shows, SmartSide growth dominates the first quarter, accounting for [ 53 or $65 million ] transformation in the quarter. The resident substitution, which Brad referenced earlier, accounts for the negative $4 million in efficiency. 
Given that SmartSide growth contributes the lion's share of our transformation dollars in the quarter, Slide 9 looks a little deep into that growth. The bar chart on the left is not repeat of Slide 8. This chart shows SmartSide revenue growth for just the quarter relative to single family starts. The pie; chart on the right provides more resolution of the also SmartSide growth. While total volume grew by 39%, the volume of the more innovative smooth prefinished and shrink products grew [indiscernible] 40%. As such, their share of the total volume increased under 5% to just over 8%. The substantially higher average selling prices of these new products also contributed 1 point to overall price growth in the fourth quarter. 
The waterfalls on Slides 10 and 11 show year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter. Slide 10 covers Siding. The 49% revenue growth for SmartSide is the result of 39% volume growth compounded by 7% price growth and at $93 million in sales and $51 million in EBITDA, for an incremental EBITDA margin of 55%. OEE and sales and marketing efficiencies offset increased costs for freight and the dwindling nonrecurrence of fiber sales reduced revenue by $20 million and EBITDA by $2 million. The resulting Siding segment EBITDA of $19 million on $285 million of revenue, yields an EBITDA margin of 32%. 
Slide 11 shows the quarter in more detail for OSB and is dominated by ongoing record high OSB prices. We estimate the impact of MDI scarcity and alternate resin substitution at roughly 80 million square feet or 7% of volume due to reduced operating efficiency for OEE. And as Brad said, the supply chain for that resin seems to have stabilized. We will, of course, continue to monitor that situation and other potential supply chain interruptions closely. LP's ability to substitute alternate resins for OSB production and therefore, to be able to strategically allocate all available MDI to the Siding [indiscernible] was a unanticipated benefit of having these segments under the LP umbrella. OSB prices will continue to grab headlines for sure, but OMP's results this quarter are no small measure of testament to the agility of the Siding and OSB operations team and LP's strategic sourcing team as they collaboratively navigated the MDlI shortage. 
And as you will see in the cash flow summary on Page 14 of the appendix of the accompanying presentation other than cash taxes, the only meaningful difference between EBITDA and operating cash flow is a substantial increase in working capital. And this is almost entirely the result of OSB prices raising accounts receivable balances and the normal seasonal accumulation of logs I mentioned earlier. 
The bridge from the $314 million of operating cash flow to the net change in cash is similarly uneventful. With buybacks, CapEx, dividends and payments associated with refinancing, our long-term debt as the only material items. Reconciliations of net income to both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income are also straightforward with depreciation and a rather large but appropriately proportional provision for taxes as the only items I've not already mentioned. 
Slide 12 provides updated guidance for capital expenditures for the year. As Brad said, we are exploring opportunities to accelerate our siding capacity expansion. The Houlton conversion, restarting Peace Valley, other growth capital and the basis of sustaining maintenance, altogether, bring our capital expenditures for the full year in the range of $230 million to $250 million. In other words, we're raising our tax guidance by about $10 million. 
And with extremely robust housing and repair and remodel markets, fueling intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, our order files give us some visibility into the remainder of the second quarter. For the OSB segment, prices continue to climb, with the result that we believe OSB revenue will be at least 30% sequentially higher in the second quarter than in the first. We also expect another strong quarter of SmartSide growth with revenue for the second quarter, at least 30% higher than last year, which would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above 20%. 
Assuming the Siding and OSB scenarios I just detailed, and given all the usual caveats about certain demand shocks or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the second quarter to be at least $580 million, another quarter of record results and outstanding cash flow generation. 
Before handing the call over for Q&A, I do want to discuss our expectations for full year revenue growth for SmartSide. Demand continues to be very strong, and we expect to continue running our mills at or near capacity at for the remainder of the year. Also, ExpertFinish, Smooth and Shakes, should continue to grow as a percentage of total Smartside volume and revenue. However, given the acceleration of growth in the second half of last year, we simply cannot increase year-over-year revenue by much more than 10% in the second half of 2021. So all said, this would bring full year SmartSide growth to roughly twice our previous long-term guidance of 10% to 12% per year. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

First of all would be adding additional press capacity at existing facilities that currently make SmartSide. We like the idea of having trained workforce on the ground. So those locations that have sufficient wood supply to accommodate significant growth. In most cases, that would mean at least doubling of growth. 
From a press standpoint, we're looking at that as what's called a brownfield scenario secondly, we -- even after Sagola, we will have Maniwaki and Peace Valley, both producing OSB and Aspen [indiscernible] baskets. And so those 2 facilities are certainly candidates for conversion. And then finally, what would be more of a greenfield scenario, which is the best example would be the cook, Minnesota pace of land that we own that would -- that has had as we've been on in the past as far as greenfielding a siding mill. So honestly, some combination of those are type of opportunities will play out, in my view, over the next 10 years as we continue to grow setting capacity. 
From a capacity standpoint, just to I mean speak generally not to be overly obvious to things, converting an existing OSB mill is probably the most without doubt the most efficient use of capital because, obviously, utilizing a lot of redundant resources. And then a brownfield facility at an existing location, it wouldn't be there would be capital efficiency associated with that. And with not buying land, there are certain components of the mill that would not have to double up on. And then, obviously, more of a greenfield scenario would be the most expensive."

We'll remind you this is an authorization not a plan to spend it. So we've got some flexibility if things were to slow down later in the year or next year. But obviously, our plan is to deploy that authorization promptly to begin the deployment promptly. The rationale behind the share repurchase as a capital allocation tool, is it even at $70 share price? Which I don't know if we're there at that moment. I don't have it in front of me, but we were [indiscernible] at the beginning of the call. I still think, and Alan, I think, shares this and certainly our Board, we still believe we're significantly undervalued. And so we feel that there's a good justification. Just on that note to buy back shares, not only just because we have the money. Rationale behind and as that remains a good investment for our shareholders to be in an aggressive share repurchase mindset at LP, and then I will reassure our shareholders that we will be prudent about that and deploy it in a way that makes sense given the economic reality at the time. 
But then again, I'm very I feel I'm very bullish about the next 4 quarters for the housing, repair and remodel and LP. So we anticipate spending that money over the next -- I don't want to set a time frame, but we plan to begin using that authorization immediately, and we'll probably buy back shares from a dollar standpoint about on the pace that we've been doing it over the past year or so."

As you were asking the question, I wrote down as a not compounding, and then you said the word before I did. But that is certainly brand equity and credibility of the brand comes with scale, and it comes with a -- maybe call it broad scale, which is penetration in several different kinds of markets. Our position in retail at a brand, the consumer, the DIY receives. And that's -- we value that a lot. We value our position on the retail website where a lot of business is moving for the big box retailers. Repair and remodel is -- for a reside project, is typically a project that's sold in the hole. And so a consumer brand and a contractor can educate and convince a consumer kind of figuratively at her kitchen table about using SmartSide as a way to build brand credibility. 
And then finally, as we expand with the builder, that really allows us to access the contractor base [indiscernible] stalling side. So -- and then we could go on with other examples, but the -- being a brand that has that kind of wide opportunity to be exposed and then taking is, I believe, does provide a compounding effect. And then on top of that, our launch export finish and the ability to access the Prefinished side of the market, which is somewhat resegments when I really also brings an aesthetic appeal to the brand that moves it beyond the contractor or consumer that kind of it as just a prime product. So this has been the fruit of past investments in marketing and sales that we've made and talked about on a lot of these calls, we continue to really focus on that and make sure that we support the brand in a way that ensures future growth. 
And I'll expect one more point on that is one of the things that we've learned through the COVID experience is you can effectively do that [indiscernible]. I think our contractors got more comfortable being educated about brand and installation cetera online. The consumer certainly has. And then once again, the big box retailer is really educating the public on how to source building products by starting online. And so we do have a strong focus there.

So I would -- from a modeling standpoint, I would say, if you carry over where we are right now and give us a little bit of leeway on mix, it would be a pretty good way of looking at the rest of the year as far as our price increase realization."

And we're doing some -- in the scale of things, it's not big dollars, but we're doing some major mill improvements down there just from all extra capital spend that we've allocated down there for the next couple of years. So I see the capacity of South America growing significantly over the next 18 months or so. And we're seeing really good market growth -- market size growth down there. And some of that is attributed to good economies, especially in Chile, but also our expansion into Argentina, Peru and Colombia has really helped as well. So diversified the markets a little bit. 
Look, there is a pricing component of that as well. I mean, it is. In no way directly tied to North America. But when things were as tight as they are right now in North America, the pressure from imports in South America diminishes and gives us a little more pricing strength in that kind of environment. And so that -- we have seen price improvement down there as well. Historically, we've been able to retain that. But it's hard for me to predict that, that will be true in the future.

We've seen incredible growth there along with the depot lows in the north. Well, where north don't report the lows and depot's growth that they have seen. So our position there was really good. Also the rebound in the Shed business, which is another big panel consumer for us, has been extremely strong. And then, I would say, overall, just the strength in housing has also been very positive for us, and I believe we've picked up some market share gain there as well. But the bigger market share gains have come through our position in retail and in shed. 
Looking forward, however, our launch is smooth and pre finish is certainly focused on a market share gain and repair and remodel. And while there is -- we do have geographic strength there, we do not have broad national strength in our par and remodel. So there's a lot of opportunity in front of us to grow in the repair and remodel segment, which is the reason behind the innovation. 
And then our other focus area for us for or we believe we're currently underpenetrated with the large national builder, and we've got a product that we're launching this year to help us address that along with other sales and marketing strategies associated with that. 
So I think -- and let me just back up from that specific answer. And just to say, I think one of the strengths of our Siding business is the diversity of channels that we sell into and the strength and diversity of our product portfolio. We're just -- we're not solely dependent on growing lab siding because of our position in panel. We're not solely depending on an panel because our position in Trim. And then as we add products like Prefinish and Shakes, it expands and diversifies that product portfolio where we can take advantage of opportunities when they arise in these different segments. And that really has been historic -- long-term historic strength of the of the portfolio, and I think it's going to serve us well as we expand it and look at further market penetration in this good market environment."

If we -- if we, being us and our channel partners, had been able to foresee the rebound in product demand in May and June, July of last year, obviously, we would not have taken the mill downtime that we've taken. And I would assume our distributor partners would not have brought their inventories down as well. So I don't I don't know if we'll look -- if this will change the way the industry looks at inventory management because I think that we're all trying to rebuild inventories back to some kind of normal level. But it is evidence that the caution that went into the cash generation mindset that we all had in late spring of last year -- or early spring of last year has really put us in a position to struggle to keep up with demand. So I think it's more of an anomaly than a long-term change and philosophy around working capital."

And so we'll be coming by later in the year to set out specific targets around other ESG parameters other than just wood procurement sustainability. 
I will mention just as from a concept standpoint, I feel like we have a really good story. When you're nailing siding on the side of a house for the 50-year warranty or you are sheading a house, you're nailing a sheet of carbon to the house. So we're -- I believe we're going to have a really good story, and -- but we want to make sure that the data that we report is accurate and that the goals we said are reasonable and something that we can do and deliver on but that work is underway.

There's various ways of getting that, and one of them has kind of hinted to earlier on the question about the price realization is working on the back end rebate part of it. And so we're -- I'm going to say we're taking advantage of the strength -- the demand strength right now to manage prices, I think, appropriately. But we have to be competitive. And while there can be short-term opportunities for pricing at the end of the day, in most all cases, we're eventually going to bid against a competitive substrate. And so we're maintaining a competitive position, even in the time of tight demand is something that we're mindful of, especially with the builder, these agreements are at least multiquarter, if not multiyear. And so we're we are focused on maintaining a competitive price situation because we are focused on gaining market share. 
I know I'm being a little bit two-faced on that answer because we also take advantage of whenever we can get price, we can get it, but we don't do that foolishly, and we want to make sure that we maintain a competitive position and that our distributors and dealer partners could be competitive as well. So it's a balancing act, I guess, is the right way to answer it, and it's something that we're really managing daily."

And then from a profit standpoint, that business has been challenged by the rising lumber prices. The agreements with the builders have a lag on lumber pricing pass-through, and that's been -- that's obviously hurt us. 
But market validation, Paul, is very solid for Integra. We're still figuring out how to meet the order file as it continues to rise, the way it has so aggressively, and then we're also trying to figure out how the properly priced the product on these kind of highly volatile times as far as lumber pricing.

So you can't like do a macro change in building. It's harder to do a macro change. So you end up having to kind of almost project-by-project basis. What we would consider changing code is what's required down there. So we've got a team working on that, and it's successful, but it's slow. 
In Chile, building codes are not an issue as far as that conversion. So -- but our focus down there is really growing our SmartSide business. Because of the fact that we've been capacity constrained in the past and the margins for OSB have been really good down there historically, we really haven't had EBITDA incentive to growth siding but as we've increased press capacity down there, it's opened up some opportunities for us to look at expanding the portfolio. And while we we've always -- we've sold siding down there since the start-up of the [indiscernible], 20 years ago. It really hasn't been as much of a focus area. It's going to be in the future because as we've grown our market share for sheeting, we are pushing up against some constraints there. And we see a siding as the next really good growth platform for sedan in South America where perhaps achieving will be more of a growth with the market versus growth in market share. 
Yes. I'm encouraged by our opportunity there, especially the other -- just kind of put a period on that, and we're very underpenetrated in Argentina, Peru and Colombia, which are -- which do have -- do use wood construction. So there also is a geographic growth element to our strategy down there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the first quarter of 2021. Robust customer demand for all of LP's products has continued, driven by ongoing strength in homebuilding and remodeling, resulting in an outstanding quarter for LP. 
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million. Smooth and ExpertFinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching 8% of total SmartSide volume. OSB prices continued to climb throughout Q1, with the result that LP's OSB segment generated extraordinary cash flow. 
LP's South American segment also had a very strong quarter, with 50% more sales and 3x more EBITDA than the first quarter of last year. As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records. 
Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan Society. Let me briefly update you on those projects. 
Houlton conversion is underway and on schedule despite some expected difficulties with travel and contractor access presented by COVID. We expect to begin SmartSide production at Houlton less than a year from now in late Q1 of next year. We are excited about the capacity expansion of these investments in Houlton represent, and we are gratified by the enthusiastic responses from local and regional suppliers and community stakeholders. Given the strength of SmartSide demand, we are exploring options to accelerate the conversion of Sagola. We're also evaluating and prioritizing subsequent projects to add capacity by conversion and/or expansion of existing facilities as well as growing prefinishing capacity. SmartSide has a long runway for growth ahead as we innovate, capture share, expand addressable markets and execute an aggressive capacity expansion strategy. 
Process to resume OSB reduction in Peace Valley is also going quite well. I want to complement the small containment has maintained the mill since we idled it in the summer of 2019. They have kept the equipment in excellent condition, and we anticipate minimal impediments to an efficient restart. We're also pleased with a number of former employees who are returning to the mill, we're glad to welcome them back, and we look forward to resuming production in early Q3. 
Last quarter, I spoke about the challenges presented by shortages of MDI, the resident use and manufacture of SmartSide and OSB. MDI availability has improved significantly, and we are essentially back to normal levels of supply with OSB mills once again using planned levels of MDI. This episode has highlighted the strategic value of having Siding and OSB integrated in LP's portfolio. 
SmartSide uses MDI exclusively, but OSB can use alternate rests. When supply has become constrained, we were able to allocate scarce MDI from OSB to Siding. Without which Siding, we have struggled to achieve another outstanding quarter of growth. 
While the MDI supply has improved, global shortage of vital asset tape-based adhesives has forced decreased production of TechShield, LP's Radiant Barrier sheeting product in the second quarter. The vinyl acetate supply situation is improving, and we expect to be back to normal levels of textile production by the end of the quarter. However, as COVID subsides in North America and the broader county rebounds a tremendous supply chain disruptions and type logistics availability are likely to present challenges going forward. We recognize the difficulties this creates for LP's customers, particularly in an environment with such strong demand. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of these issues through strategic sourcing and network optimization, and we are adding SmartSide and OSB capacity as safely, efficiently and quickly as possible. 
Finally, I'm happy to announce that LP is in the initial phases of returning to our national headquarters after more than a year of working from home. While we have a relieved and gratified to be slowly getting back to normal, I want to acknowledge it for the majority of LP's mill employees as well as many customers, working from home was not feasible. 
And while COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the U.S. and Chile, vaccination rates continue to lag in Canada and Brazil. The situation is improving, but we are not out of the woods yet. Ongoing diligence in care exercised by LP's pandemic response team and mill employees are helping minimize operational impacts from COVID, enabling LP to supply our customers the products they need to build and renovate homes. I encourage all of them and all of you on the call to continue to exercise appropriate precautions and get vaccinated as soon as possible. 
LP had a remarkable first quarter. And while challenges remain, very strong housing in RNR markets resulting in intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, keeping our near-term outlook exceptionally positive. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for Q1 and outlook for Q2."
286119,711181954,2268700,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brad. Slide 6 shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers. Compared to the first quarter of last",1223,"Thanks, Brad. Slide 6 shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers. 
Compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by 74% to just over $1 billion, driven by 49% growth in SmartSide and over $330 million of significantly higher OSB prices. The resulting EBITDA of $461 million is more than 5x last year's result. We generated $314 million of operating cash flow, including increased capital investments and heavy spending on logs, common practice for LP in the first quarter. The $3.01 per share of adjusted earnings is 10x that in the first quarter last year. 
In terms of capital allocation, we paid $17 million in dividends in the first quarter and spent $122 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares. We've continued buying back shares through the second quarter and as of the close of business yesterday, had just $32 million remaining of our existing $300 million buyback authorization. All else equal, that remaining authorization will be exhausted by the end of this week. I'm therefore, delighted to report that LP's Board of Directors has authorized a further $1 billion of share repurchases, which we plan to launch immediately. LP's Board also declared a dividend of $0.16 per share payable on June 1. 
Slide 7 highlights the cleanliness of the quarter from a reporting perspective. Continued SmartSide growth and OSB price appreciation resulted in $93 million and $333 million, respectively, of incremental revenue for the quarter, compared to which everything else is really just a rounding error. All $333 million of the incremental OSB pricing and 55% of the incremental SmartSide revenue translated into EBITDA, with everything else aggregating to a net negative of $6 million. 
Slide 8 provides an update on our transformation. On a trailing 12-month basis, SmartSide revenue grew at twice the rate of single-family housing starts. Consequently, and as the table on the right shows, SmartSide growth dominates the first quarter, accounting for $53 million or $65 million transformation in the quarter. The resident substitution, which Brad referenced earlier, accounts for the negative $4 million in efficiency. 
Given that SmartSide growth contributes the lion's share of our transformation dollars in the quarter, Slide 9 looks a little deep into that growth. The bar chart on the left is not repeat of Slide 8. This chart shows SmartSide revenue growth for just the quarter relative to single family starts. The pie chart on the right provides more resolution of the also SmartSide growth. While total volume grew by 39%, the volume of the more innovative smooth prefinished and shrink products grew to 140%. As such, their share of the total volume increased under 5% to just over 8%. The substantially higher average selling prices of these new products also contributed 1 point to overall price growth in the fourth quarter. 
The waterfalls on Slides 10 and 11 show year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter. Slide 10 covers Siding. The 49% revenue growth for SmartSide is the result of 39% volume growth compounded by 7% price growth and at $93 million in sales and $51 million in EBITDA, for an incremental EBITDA margin of 55%. OEE and sales and marketing efficiencies offset increased costs for freight and the dwindling nonrecurrence of fiber sales reduced revenue by $20 million and EBITDA by $2 million. The resulting Siding segment EBITDA of $19 million on $285 million of revenue, yields an EBITDA margin of 32%. 
Slide 11 shows the quarter in more detail for OSB and is dominated by ongoing record high OSB prices. We estimate the impact of MDI scarcity and alternate resin substitution at roughly 80 million square feet or 7% of volume due to reduced operating efficiency for OEE. And as Brad said, the supply chain for that resin seems to have stabilized. We will, of course, continue to monitor that situation and other potential supply chain interruptions closely. LP's ability to substitute alternate resins for OSB production and therefore, to be able to strategically allocate all available MDI to the Siding [indiscernible] was a unanticipated benefit of having these segments under the LP umbrella. OSB prices will continue to grab headlines for sure, but OMP's results this quarter are no small measure of testament to the agility of the Siding and OSB operations team and LP's strategic sourcing team as they collaboratively navigated the MDl shortage.
And as you will see in the cash flow summary on Page 14 of the appendix of the accompanying presentation other than cash taxes, the only meaningful difference between EBITDA and operating cash flow is a substantial increase in working capital. And this is almost entirely the result of OSB prices raising accounts receivable balances and the normal seasonal accumulation of logs I mentioned earlier. 
The bridge from the $314 million of operating cash flow to the net change in cash is similarly uneventful. With buybacks, CapEx, dividends and payments associated with refinancing, our long-term debt as the only material items. Reconciliations of net income to both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income are also straightforward with depreciation and a rather large but appropriately proportional provision for taxes as the only items I've not already mentioned. 
Slide 12 provides updated guidance for capital expenditures for the year. As Brad said, we are exploring opportunities to accelerate our siding capacity expansion. The Houlton conversion, restarting Peace Valley, other growth capital and the basis of sustaining maintenance, altogether, bring our capital expenditures for the full year in the range of $230 million to $250 million. In other words, we're raising our tax guidance by about $10 million. 
And with extremely robust housing and repair and remodel markets, fueling intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, our order files give us some visibility into the remainder of the second quarter. For the OSB segment, prices continue to climb, with the result that we believe OSB revenue will be at least 30% sequentially higher in the second quarter than in the first. We also expect another strong quarter of SmartSide growth with revenue for the second quarter, at least 30% higher than last year, which would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above 20%. 
Assuming the Siding and OSB scenarios I just detailed and given all the usual caveats about certain demand shocks or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the second quarter to be at least $580 million, another quarter of record results and outstanding cash flow generation. 
Before handing the call over for Q&A, I do want to discuss our expectations for full year revenue growth for SmartSide. Demand continues to be very strong, and we expect to continue running our mills at or near capacity at for the remainder of the year. Also, ExpertFinish, Smooth and Shakes, should continue to grow as a percentage of total Smartside volume and revenue. However, given the acceleration of growth in the second half of last year, we simply cannot increase year-over-year revenue by much more than 10% in the second half of 2021. So all said, this would bring full year SmartSide growth to roughly twice our previous long-term guidance of 10% to 12% per year. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

First of all would be adding additional press capacity at existing facilities that currently make SmartSide. We like the idea of having trained workforce on the ground. So those locations that have sufficient wood supply to accommodate significant growth. In most cases, that would mean at least doubling of growth. 
From a press standpoint, we're looking at that as what's called a brownfield scenario secondly, we -- even after Sagola, we will have Maniwaki and Peace Valley, both producing OSB and Aspen [indiscernible] baskets. And so those 2 facilities are certainly candidates for conversion. And then finally, what would be more of a greenfield scenario, which is the best example would be the cook, Minnesota pace of land that we own that would -- that has had as we've been on in the past as far as greenfielding a siding mill. So honestly, some combination of those are type of opportunities will play out, in my view, over the next 10 years as we continue to grow setting capacity. 
From a capacity standpoint, just to I mean speak generally not to be overly obvious to things, converting an existing OSB mill is probably the most without doubt the most efficient use of capital because, obviously, utilizing a lot of redundant resources. And then a brownfield facility at an existing location, it wouldn't be there would be capital efficiency associated with that. And with not buying land, there are certain components of the mill that would not have to double up on. And then, obviously, more of a greenfield scenario would be the most expensive."

Our position in retail at a brand, the consumer, the DIY receives. And that's -- we value that a lot. We value our position on the retail website where a lot of business is moving for the big box retailers. Repair and remodel is -- for a reside project, is typically a project that's sold in the hole. And so a consumer brand and a contractor can educate and convince a consumer kind of figuratively at her kitchen table about using SmartSide as a way to build brand credibility. 
And then finally, as we expand with the builder, that really allows us to access the contractor base [indiscernible] stalling side. So -- and then we could go on with other examples, but the -- being a brand that has that kind of wide opportunity to be exposed and then taking is, I believe, does provide a compounding effect. And then on top of that, our launch export finish and the ability to access the Prefinished side of the market, which is somewhat re segments when I really also brings an aesthetic appeal to the brand that moves it beyond the contractor or consumer that kind of it as just a prime product. So this has been the fruit of past investments in marketing and sales that we've made and talked about on a lot of these calls, we continue to really focus on that and make sure that we support the brand in a way that ensures future growth. 
And I'll expect one more point on that is one of the things that we've learned through the COVID experience is you can effectively do that [indiscernible]. I think our contractors got more comfortable being educated about brand and installation cetera online. The consumer certainly has. And then once again, the big box retailer is really educating the public on how to source building products by starting online. And so we do have a strong focus there.

And we've -- what we're realizing now is maybe 3% to 4% overall, and then the mix change has been very positive, added about another percent on not pricing. So I would say it's but we've probably gotten a little bit stronger price realization on the back end of the increase than we've gotten in prior years, but it's just a the strength of the demand right now is able to hold on -- allowed us to hold on some of that list pricing that we increased at the beginning of the year. 
So I would -- from a modeling standpoint, I would say, if you carry over where we are right now and give us a little bit of leeway on mix, it would be a pretty good way of looking at the rest of the year as far as our price increase realization."

I think that's also true for OSB as people move into the winter and try to button up some jobs and get the house siding or [indiscernible]. So we've typically seen really good seasonal demand now, have that demand plateau and the summer is kind of at a constant rate of construction. And then we would generally see a little surge in demand September, October as people were trying mentioned trying to -- what I think was people trying to complete some jobs before the winter weather hit. So we're certainly in a historically in a really good time and season right now, and we're expecting to see continued very strong order files at least until October. 
But given the lack of inventory in the channel right now for both OSB, Siding and for EWP in there as well, I anticipate that even in the winter, we'll see pretty good order files as distributors and dealers take that opportunity to rebuild some inventory, they're looking into what we expect to be a strong building season next year as well."

And we're doing some -- in the scale of things, it's not big dollars, but we're doing some major mill improvements down there just from all extra capital spend that we've allocated down there for the next couple of years. So I see the capacity of South America growing significantly over the next 18 months or so. And we're seeing really good market growth -- market size growth down there. And some of that is attributed to good economies, especially in Chile, but also our expansion into Argentina, Peru and Colombia has really helped as well. So diversified the markets a little bit. 
Look, there is a pricing component of that as well. I mean, it is. In no way directly tied to North America. But when things were as tight as they are right now in North America, the pressure from imports in South America diminishes and gives us a little more pricing strength in that kind of environment. And so that -- we have seen price improvement down there as well. Historically, we've been able to retain that. But it's hard for me to predict that, that will be true in the future. But we've seen good price appreciation and really good volumes down there."

We've seen incredible growth there along with the depot lows in the north. Well, where north don't report the lows and depot's growth that they have seen. So our position there was really good. Also, the rebound in the Shed business, which is another big panel consumer for us, has been extremely strong. And then, I would say, overall, just the strength in housing has also been very positive for us, and I believe we've picked up some market share gain there as well. But the bigger market share gains have come through our position in retail and in shed. 
Looking forward, however, our launch is smooth and pre finish is certainly focused on a market share gain and repair and remodel. And while there is -- we do have geographic strength there, we do not have broad national strength in our par and remodel. So there's a lot of opportunity in front of us to grow in the repair and remodel segment, which is the reason behind the innovation. 
And then our other focus area for us for or we believe we're currently underpenetrated with the large national builder, and we've got a product that we're launching this year to help us address that along with other sales and marketing strategies associated with that. 
So I think -- and let me just back up from that specific answer. And just to say, I think one of the strengths of our Siding business is the diversity of channels that we sell into and the strength and diversity of our product portfolio. We're just -- we're not solely dependent on growing lab siding because of our position in panel. We're not solely depending on an panel because our position in Trim. And then as we add products like Prefinish and Shakes, it expands and diversifies that product portfolio where we can take advantage of opportunities when they arise in these different segments. And that really has been historic -- long-term historic strength of the of the portfolio, and I think it's going to serve us well as we expand it and look at further market penetration in this good market environment."

So I don't I don't know if we'll look -- if this will change the way the industry looks at inventory management because I think that we're all trying to rebuild inventories back to some kind of normal level.

And so we're -- I'm going to say we're taking advantage of the strength -- the demand strength right now to manage prices, I think, appropriately. But we have to be competitive. And while there can be short-term opportunities for pricing at the end of the day, in most all cases, we're eventually going to bid against a competitive substrate.

And so we're we are focused on maintaining a competitive price situation because we are focused on gaining market share. 
I know I'm being a little bit two-faced on that answer because we also take advantage of whenever we can get price, we can get it, but we don't do that foolishly, and we want to make sure that we maintain a competitive position and that our distributors and dealer partners could be competitive as well.

What we would consider changing code is what's required down there. So we've got a team working on that, and it's successful, but it's slow. 
In Chile, building codes are not an issue as far as that conversion. So -- but our focus down there is really growing our SmartSide business. Because of the fact that we've been capacity constrained in the past and the margins for OSB have been really good down there historically, we really haven't had EBITDA incentive to growth siding but as we've increased press capacity down there, it's opened up some opportunities for us to look at expanding the portfolio. And while we we've always -- we've sold siding down there since the start-up of the [indiscernible], 20 years ago. It really hasn't been as much of a focus area. It's going to be in the future because as we've grown our market share for sheeting, we are pushing up against some constraints there. And we see a siding as the next really good growth platform for sedan in South America where perhaps achieving will be more of a growth with the market versus growth in market share. 
Yes. I'm encouraged by our opportunity there, especially the other -- just kind of put a period on that, and we're very underpenetrated in Argentina, Peru and Colombia, which are -- which do have -- do use wood construction. So there also is a geographic growth element to our strategy down there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the first quarter of 2021. Robust customer demand for all of LP's products has continued, driven by ongoing strength in homebuilding and remodeling, resulting in an outstanding quarter for LP. 
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million. Smooth and ExpertFinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching 8% of total SmartSide volume. OSB prices continued to climb throughout Q1, with the result that LP's OSB segment generated extraordinary cash flow. 
LP's South American segment also had a very strong quarter, with 50% more sales and 3x more EBITDA than the first quarter of last year. As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records. 
Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan to siding. Let me briefly update you on those projects. 
The Houlton conversion is underway and on schedule despite some expected difficulties with travel and contractor access presented by COVID. We expect to begin SmartSide production at Houlton less than a year from now in late Q1 of next year. We are excited about the capacity expansion that these investments in Houlton represent, and we are gratified by the enthusiastic responses from local and regional suppliers and community stakeholders. Given the strength of SmartSide demand, we are exploring options to accelerate the conversion of Sagola. We're also evaluating and prioritizing subsequent projects to add capacity by conversion and/or expansion of existing facilities as well as growing prefinishing capacity. SmartSide has a long runway for growth ahead as we innovate, capture share, expand addressable markets and execute an aggressive capacity expansion strategy. 
Process to resume OSB reduction in Peace Valley is also going quite well. I want to complement the small team that has maintained the mill since we idled it in the summer of 2019. They have kept the equipment in excellent condition, and we anticipate minimal impediments to an efficient restart. We're also pleased by the number of former employees who are returning to the mill, we're glad to welcome them back, and we look forward to resuming production in early Q3. 
Last quarter, I spoke about the challenges presented by shortages of MDI, the resident use and manufacture of SmartSide and OSB. MDI availability has improved significantly, and we are essentially back to normal levels of supply with OSB mills once again using planned levels of MDI. This episode has highlighted the strategic value of having Siding and OSB integrated in LP's portfolio. 
SmartSide uses MDI exclusively, but OSB can use alternate rests. When supply has become constrained, we were able to allocate scarce MDI from OSB to Siding. Without which Siding, we have struggled to achieve another outstanding quarter of growth. 
While the MDI supply has improved, global shortage of vinyl acetate-based adhesives has forced decreased production of TechShield, LP's Radiant Barrier sheeting product in the second quarter. The vinyl acetate supply situation is improving, and we expect to be back to normal levels of TechShield production by the end of the quarter. However, as COVID subsides in North America and the broader economy rebounds, supply chain disruptions and tight logistics availability are likely to present challenges going forward. We recognize the difficulties this creates for LP's customers, particularly in an environment with such strong demand. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of these issues through strategic sourcing and network optimization, and we are adding SmartSide and OSB capacity as safely, efficiently and quickly as possible. 
Finally, I'm happy to announce that LP is in the initial phases of returning to our national headquarters after more than a year of working from home. While we are relieved and gratified to be slowly getting back to normal, I want to acknowledge that for the majority of LP's mill employees as well as many customers, working from home was not feasible. 
And while COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the U.S. and Chile, vaccination rates continue to lag in Canada and Brazil. The situation is improving, but we are not out of the woods yet. Ongoing diligence in care exercised by LP's pandemic response team and mill employees are helping minimize operational impacts from COVID, enabling LP to supply our customers the products they need to build and renovate homes. I encourage all of them and all of you on the call to continue to exercise appropriate precautions and get vaccinated as soon as possible. 
LP had a remarkable first quarter. And while challenges remain, very strong housing in RNR markets resulting in intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, keeping our near-term outlook exceptionally positive. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for Q1 and outlook for Q2."
286119,711181954,2304439,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brad. Slide 6 shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers. Compared to the first quarter of last",1226,"Thanks, Brad. Slide 6 shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers. 
Compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by 74% to just over $1 billion, driven by 49% growth in SmartSide and over $330 million of significantly higher OSB prices. The resulting EBITDA of $461 million is more than 5x last year's result. We generated $314 million of operating cash flow, including increased capital investments and heavy spending on logs, common practice for LP in the first quarter. The $3.01 per share of adjusted earnings is 10x that in the first quarter last year. 
In terms of capital allocation, we paid $17 million in dividends in the first quarter and spent $122 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares. We've continued buying back shares through the second quarter and as of the close of business yesterday, had just $32 million remaining of our existing $300 million buyback authorization. All else equal, that remaining authorization will be exhausted by the end of this week. I'm therefore delighted to report that LP's Board of Directors has authorized a further $1 billion of share repurchases, which we plan to launch immediately. LP's Board also declared a dividend of $0.16 per share payable on June 1. 
Slide 7 highlights the cleanliness of the quarter from a reporting perspective. Continued SmartSide growth and OSB price appreciation resulted in $93 million and $333 million, respectively, of incremental revenue for the quarter, compared to which everything else is really just a rounding error. All $333 million of the incremental OSB pricing and 55% of the incremental SmartSide revenue translated into EBITDA, with everything else aggregating to a net negative of $6 million. 
Slide 8 provides an update on our transformation. On a trailing 12-month basis, SmartSide revenue grew at twice the rate of single-family housing starts. Consequently, and as the table on the right shows, SmartSide growth dominates the first quarter, accounting for $53 million of $65 million transformation in the quarter. The resident substitution, which Brad referenced earlier, accounts for the negative $4 million in efficiency. 
Given that SmartSide growth contributes the lion's share of our transformation dollars in the quarter, Slide 9 looks a little deep into that growth. The bar chart on the left is not repeat of Slide 8. This chart shows SmartSide revenue growth for just the quarter relative to single family starts. The pie chart on the right provides more resolution of the sources of SmartSide growth. While total volume grew by 39%, the volume of the more innovative smooth, prefinished and shake products grew to 140%. As such, their share of the total volume increased from under 5% to just over 8%. The substantially higher average selling prices of these new products also contributed 1 point to overall price growth in the fourth quarter. 
The waterfalls on Slides 10 and 11 show year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter. Slide 10 covers Siding. The 49% revenue growth for SmartSide is the result of 39% volume growth compounded by 7% price growth and adds $93 million in sales and $51 million in EBITDA, for an incremental EBITDA margin of 55%. OEE and sales and marketing efficiencies offset increased costs for freight and the dwindling nonrecurrence of fiber sales reduced revenue by $20 million and EBITDA by $2 million. The resulting Siding segment EBITDA of $90 million on $285 million of revenue, yields an EBITDA margin of 32%. 
Slide 11 shows the quarter in more detail for OSB and is dominated by ongoing record high OSB prices. We estimate the impact of MDI scarcity and alternate resin substitution at roughly 80 million square feet or 7% of volume due to reduced operating efficiency or OEE. And as Brad said, the supply chain for that resin seems to have stabilized. We will, of course, continue to monitor that situation and other potential supply chain interruptions closely. LP's ability to substitute alternate resins for OSB production and therefore, to be able to strategically allocate all available MDI to the Siding segment was a unanticipated benefit of having these segments under the LP umbrella. OSB prices will continue to grab headlines for sure, but LP's results this quarter are in no small measure a testament to the agility of the Siding and OSB operations team and LP's strategic sourcing team as they collaboratively navigated the MDI shortage.
And as you will see in the cash flow summary on Page 14 of the appendix of the accompanying presentation other than cash taxes, the only meaningful difference between EBITDA and operating cash flow is a substantial increase in working capital. And this is almost entirely the result of higher OSB prices raising accounts receivable balances and the normal seasonal accumulation of logs I mentioned earlier. 
The bridge from the $314 million of operating cash flow to the net change in cash is similarly uneventful. With buybacks, CapEx, dividends and payments associated with refinancing, our long-term debt as the only material items. Reconciliations of net income to both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income are also straightforward with depreciation and a rather large but appropriately proportional provision for taxes as the only items I've not already mentioned. 
Slide 12 provides updated guidance for capital expenditures for the year. As Brad said, we are exploring opportunities to accelerate our siding capacity expansion. The Houlton conversion, restarting Peace Valley, other growth capital and the basis of sustaining maintenance, altogether, bring our capital expenditures for the full year in the range of $230 million to $250 million. In other words, we're raising our CapEx guidance by about $10 million. 
And with extremely robust housing and repair and remodel markets, fueling intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, our order files give us some visibility into the remainder of the second quarter. For the OSB segment, prices continue to climb, with the result that we believe OSB revenue will be at least 30% sequentially higher in the second quarter than in the first. We also expect another strong quarter of SmartSide growth with revenue for the second quarter, at least 30% higher than last year, which would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of growth above 20%. 
Assuming the Siding and OSB scenarios I just detailed and given all the usual caveats about certain demand shocks or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the second quarter to be at least $580 million, another quarter of record results and outstanding cash flow generation. 
Before handing the call over for Q&A, I do want to discuss our expectations for full year revenue growth for SmartSide. Demand continues to be very strong, and we expect to continue running our mills at or near capacity for the remainder of the year. Also, ExpertFinish, Smooth and Shakes, should continue to grow as a percentage of total Smartside volume and revenue. However, given the acceleration of growth in the second half of last year, we simply cannot increase year-over-year revenue by much more than 10% in the second half of 2021. So all said, this would bring full year SmartSide growth to roughly twice our previous long-term guidance of 10% to 12% per year. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

First of all would be adding additional press capacity at existing facilities that currently make SmartSide. We like the idea of having a trained workforce on the ground. So those locations that have sufficient wood supply to accommodate significant growth. In most cases, that would mean at least doubling of growth. 
From a press standpoint, we're looking at that as what's called a brownfield scenario. Secondly, we -- even after Sagola, we will have Maniwaki and Peace Valley, both producing OSB and Aspen wood baskets. And so those 2 facilities are certainly candidates for conversion. And then finally, what would be more of a greenfield scenario, which is the best example would be the cook, Minnesota piece of land that we own that would -- that has had, as we've planned on in the past as far as greenfielding a siding mill. So honestly, some combination of those 3 type of opportunities will play out, in my view, over the next 10 years as we continue to grow siding capacity. 
From a capacity standpoint, just to I mean speak generally, not to be overly obvious about things, converting an existing OSB mill is probably the most -- without doubt the most efficient use of capital because, obviously, utilizing a lot of redundant resources. And then a brownfield facility at an existing location, it wouldn't be -- there would be capital efficiency associated with that. But not buying land, there are certain components of the mill that would not have to double up on. And then, obviously, more of a greenfield scenario would be the most expensive."

So there's -- in our view, in my view, specifically, we're not risking the company at all by this $1 billion, certainly doable from a cash generation standpoint. We'll remind you this is an authorization not a plan to spend it. So we've got some flexibility if things were to slow down later in the year or next year. But obviously, our plan is to deploy that authorization promptly to begin the deployment promptly. The rationale behind the share repurchase as a capital allocation tool, is it even at $70 share price? Which I don't know if we're there at that moment. I don't have it in front of me, but we were at the beginning of the call. I still think, and Alan, I think, shares this and certainly our Board, we still believe we're significantly undervalued. And so we feel that there's a good justification. Just on that note to buy back shares, not only just because we have the money. So our rationale behind that is that it remains a good investment for our shareholders to be in an aggressive share repurchase mindset at LP, and then I will reassure our shareholders that we will be prudent about that and deploy it in a way that makes sense given the economic reality at the time. 
But then again, I'm very -- I feel I'm very bullish about the next 4 quarters for the housing, repair and remodel and LP. So we anticipate spending that money over the next -- I don't want to set a time frame, but we plan to begin using that authorization immediately, and we'll probably buy back shares from a dollar standpoint about on the pace that we've been doing it over the past year or so."

As you were asking the question, I wrote down as a note ""compounding"" and then you said the word before I did. But that is certainly brand equity and credibility of the brand comes with scale, and it comes with a -- maybe call it broad scale, which is penetration in several different kinds of markets. Our position in retail makes it a brand that the consumer, the DIYer sees. And that's -- we value that a lot. We value our position on the retail websites where a lot of business is moving for the big box retailers. Repair and remodel is -- for a reside project, is typically a project that's sold in the home. And so a consumer brand and a contractor can educate and convince a consumer kind of figuratively at their kitchen table about using SmartSide as a way to build brand credibility. 
And then finally, as we expand with the builder, that really allows us to access a contractor base on the installing side. So -- and then we could go on with other examples, but the -- being a brand that has that kind of wide opportunity to be exposed and then taking advantage of that is, I believe -- does provide a compounding effect. And then on top of that, our launch of ExpertFinish and the ability to access the Prefinished side of that market, which is somewhat the same as when I was talking about repair and remodel, really also brings an aesthetic appeal to the brand that moves it beyond the contractor or consumer thinking of it as just a prime product. So this has been the fruit of past investments in marketing and sales that we've made and talked about on a lot of these calls. We continue to really focus on that and make sure that we support the brand in a way that ensures future growth. 
And I'll just make one more point on that, is one of the things that we've learned through the COVID experience is you can effectively do that online. I think our contractors, contract customers have moved to getting educated about -- or got more comfortable being educated about brand and installation etcetera online. The consumer certainly has. And then once again, the big box retailer is really educating the public on how to source building products by starting online. And so we do have a strong focus there. And I'm really pleased with the progress we've made so far."

So we've typically seen really good seasonal demand now, had that demand plateau in the summer as it kind of hit a constant rate of construction. And then we would generally see a little surge in demand September, October as people were trying, as I was mentioning, trying to -- what I think was people trying to complete some jobs before the winter weather hit. So we're certainly in a -- historically in a really good time and season right now, and we're expecting to see continued very strong order files at least until October. 
But given the lack of inventory in the channel right now for both OSB, Siding and throw EWP in there as well, I anticipate that even in the winter, we'll see pretty good order files as distributors and dealers take that opportunity to rebuild some inventory, they're looking into what we expect to be a strong building season next year as well."

From a volume standpoint, I feel really good about the sustainability. And we're doing some -- in the scale of things, it's not big dollars, but we're doing some major mill improvements down there just from the little extra capital spend that we've allocated down there for the next couple of years. So I see the capacity of South America growing significantly over the next 18 months or so. And we're seeing really good market growth -- market size growth down there. And some of that is attributed to good economies, especially in Chile, but also our expansion into Argentina, Peru and Colombia has really helped as well. So diversified the markets a little bit. 
Look, there is a pricing component of that as well. I mean, it is in no way directly tied to North America. But when things were as tight as they are right now in North America, the pressure from imports in South America diminishes and gives us a little more pricing strength in that kind of environment. And so that -- we have seen price improvement down there as well. Historically, we've been able to retain that. But it's hard for me to predict that, that will be true in the future.

So looking back the last 12 months or so with the good market share gains, as we've mentioned before, our position at retail has been very beneficial to us. We've seen incredible growth there along with the Depot lows and Menards -- well, Menards doesn't report but lows in Depot's growth that they have seen. So our position there was really good. Also, the rebound in the Shed business, which is another big panel consumer for us, has been extremely strong. And then, I would say, overall, just the strength in housing has also been very positive for us, and I believe we've picked up some market share gain there as well. But the bigger market share gains have come through our position in retail and in shed. 
Looking forward, however, our launch is smooth and prefinish is certainly focused on a market share gain in repair and remodel. And while there is -- we do have geographic strength there, we do not have broad national strength in repair and remodel. So there's a lot of opportunity in front of us to grow in the repair and remodel segment, which is the reason behind the innovation. 
And then our other focus area for us for where we believe we're currently underpenetrated is with a large national builder, and we've got a product that we're launching this year to help us address that along with other sales and marketing strategies associated with that. 
So I think -- and let me just back up from that specific answer. And just to say, I think one of the strengths of our Siding business is the diversity of channels that we sell into and the strength and diversity of our product portfolio. We're just -- we're not solely dependent on growing lap siding because of our position in panel. We're not solely depending on an panel because our position in trim. And then as we add products like Prefinished and Shakes, it expands and diversifies that product portfolio where we can take advantage of opportunities when they arise in these different segments. And that really has been historic -- long-term historic strength of the portfolio, and I think it's going to serve us well as we expand it and look at further market penetration in this good market environment."

So that was really how we are addressing it is through Peace Valley start-up and then continued OEE improvement across our entire OSB network. But we're really focused on growth in Siding. And Sagola is the next great idea in front of us as far as doing that. So we're pretty single-minded in getting that mill up and running as quickly as possible and our expectation is that our OSB market share, though, will be protected by the start-up of Peace Valley."

And I would assume our distributor partners would not have brought their inventories down as well. So I don't know if this will change the way the industry looks at inventory management because I think that we're all trying to rebuild inventories back to some kind of normal level. But it is evidenced that the caution that went into the cash generation mindset that we all had in late spring of last year -- or early spring of last year has really put us in a position to struggle to keep up with demand.

There's various ways of getting that, and one of them was kind of hinted to earlier on the question about the price realization is working on the back end rebate part of it. And so we're -- I'm going to say we're taking advantage of the strength -- the demand strength right now to manage prices, I think, appropriately. But we have to be competitive. And while there can be short-term opportunities for pricing at the end of the day, in most all cases, we're eventually going to get bid against a competitive substrate. And so we're maintaining a competitive position, even in the time of tight demand is something that we're mindful of, especially with the builder, these agreements are at least multiquarter, if not multiyear. And so we are focused on maintaining a competitive price situation because we are focused on gaining market share. 
I know I'm being a little bit two-faced on that answer because we also take advantage of whenever we can get price, we can get it, but we don't do that foolishly, and we want to make sure that we maintain a competitive position and that our distributors and dealer partners could be competitive as well.

In Chile, building codes are not an issue as far as that conversion. So -- but our focus down there is really growing our SmartSide business. Because of the fact that we've been capacity constrained in the past and the margins for OSB have been really good down there historically, we really haven't had EBITDA incentive to grow Siding but as we've increased press capacity down there, it's opened up some opportunities for us to look at expanding the portfolio. And while we we've always -- we've sold siding down there since the start-up of the Panguipulli, 20 years ago. It really hasn't been as much of a focus area as it's going to be in the future because as we've grown our market share for sheathing, we are pushing up against some constraints there. And we see a Siding as the next really good growth platform for us down in South America where perhaps sheathing will be more of a growth with the market versus growth in market share. 
Yes. I'm encouraged by our opportunity there, especially the other -- just kind of put a period on that, and we're very underpenetrated in Argentina, Peru and Colombia, which are -- which do have -- do use wood construction. So there also is a geographic growth element to our strategy down there."

Thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the second quarter of 2021. Q2 was another remarkable quarter for LP Building Solutions. All our segments set records for sales and EBITDA in the second quarter with over 150,000 housing starts in June, single-family mix over 70% and repair and remodel indices equally robust, we are encouraged that demand for LP's products remain very strong. 
As you will see on Slide 6 of the accompanying presentation, net sales for Q2 reached $1.3 billion more than 140% over Q2 of last year, which was, of course, a weak comp due to the onset of COVID-19. EBITDA was $684 million, generating $457 million in operating cash flow and $4.74 in earnings per share. 
Siding Solutions growth is a significant component of these results as Slide 7 illustrates. Siding Solutions includes prime to prefinish SmartSide as well as innovative strand-based Siding products sold under other brand names. Revenue for Siding Solutions grew by 39% compared to last year. This is composed of 27% volume growth compounded by 9% price growth. 
In addition to market penetration and share gains, Siding is growing through product innovation, the most innovative and value-added subset of Siding solutions, which includes SmartSide Smooth, Shakes and Expert Vanish and LP's new builder series Siding combined for 9% of total volume in Q2. This is compared to 6% last year, and these new products contributed more than 1 point to the 9% increase. 
For LP's OSB segment, extraordinary prices generated impressive cash flows but also overshadowed important gains in Structural Solutions volume. OSB prices have pulled back in recent weeks, and we have not wavered from our strategy of growing structural solutions and supply market demand agility. In fact, in Q2, we grew Structural Solutions as a percentage of total OSB volume by 5 points compared to prior year quarter. 
While not driving our strategy, OSB prices do, of course, continue to be a significant driver of LP's cash flow and share repurchases, about which Alan will update you in a few minutes. LP South America segment also had a very strong quarter with OSB and Siding price increases more than offsetting raw material cost inflation. South American sales almost doubled and EBITDA tripled compared to last year. 
Let me briefly update you on our capacity expansion projects, beginning with the Siding conversion in hold. While material costs particularly still have been subject to inflationary pressures, the project is on schedule. We expect to begin SmartSide production at Hilton in late Q1 of 2022. We continue to work to accelerate the Sagola conversion, and we are currently planning to start SmartSide production there in the first quarter of 2023. 
Finally, we are implementing projects to optimize our production and distribution processes that should result in incremental gains in production capacity across our mills. As for LP's Peace Valley OSB mill, I'm happy to announce that Peace Valley pressed its first Board of OSP in late June. We have received APA Certification in our shipping product, including TechShield Radiant Barrier, a significant contributor to Structural Solutions growth. I want to thank the team that maintained Peace Valley so diligently what was idled congratulate them and everyone else that contributed to the safe and efficient resumption of production at Peace Valley. 
In previous quarterly calls, I have discussed shortages of resin and adhesives as well as LP's operational responses to mitigate the impacts of these disruptions. As the broader economy continues to sign even recovery, we expect intermittent supply chain challenges to continue. LP's Strategic Sourcing teams is working diligently to minimize disruptions. This includes collaborating with our operations teams to allocate any scarce inputs consistent with our transformation strategy as we did with MDI resin in the first quarter. 
Both categories of the raw materials LP consumed saw significant price decreases in 2020 and as demand fell in sectors of the economy more severely impacted by COVID than housing. Many of those sectors are now rebounding with the result, the demand and therefore, prices are increasing. In some cases, availability has been hampered by supply chain interruptions elsewhere, as was the case with certain resins. Raw material prices are now back at 2019 levels or in some cases, above. Consumer and producer price indices is generally trend upward. The situation is fluid, but we expect these inflationary pressures to persist for some time as the U.S. economy recovers and grows. 
Before I turn the call over to Alan to review our financial performance in more detail, I want to briefly preview some planned enhancements to LP's ESG disclosures. We recently completed environmental product declaration for SmartSide Siding. We believe that SmartSide looks and performs better than competing alternatives. We also believe the data shows that SmartSide is significantly more sustainable with a much smaller carbon footprint. In coming quarters, we plan to disclose additional information under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB framework. Sustainability is central to our transformation strategy at LP. We believe we have a good story to tell, and we look forward to telling it. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results in Q2, an update on our share repurchases and our outlook for Q3."
286119,1673768680,2360718,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning. As Brad has already said, all segments set new records for revenue and EBITDA in the second quarter. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 39% and OSB and EWP prices were significantly higher in both North and South America. In",1369,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning. As Brad has already said, all segments set new records for revenue and EBITDA in the second quarter. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 39% and OSB and EWP prices were significantly higher in both North and South America. In fact, sales for EWP and LPSA doubled compared to last year, with their combined EBITDA more than triple. And Entekra delivered a record 324 units for $22 million of revenue, a tenfold increase over last year. As a result, LP generated $1.3 billion in sales, $684 million of EBITDA, $457 million of operating cash flow and $4.74 in adjusted earnings per share. 
Page 8 of the presentation summarizes the year-over-year comparisons for revenue and EBITDA at a high level. Inflationary pressures in wages, raw materials and freight, especially when compared to softer prices last year, produced an EBITDA headwind of $24 million. Maintenance and other spending account for the remaining at first $31 million. 
The waterfalls on Slides 9 and 10 show year-over-year revenue and EBITDA comparisons for the Siding and OSB segments. Siding Solutions saw volume growth of 27% and price growth of 9% for revenue growth of 39%. This generated an additional $81 million of revenue and $53 million of EBITDA and incremental EBITDA margin of 65%. Notably, the 9% price increase in the quarter includes 4 percentage points from annual list price increases and 3 points on the back up. That is from reduced discounts and rebates. 
The highest value-added subset of products, which includes Expert Finish, Smooth, Shakes and build a series punches well above its weight in terms of price. Accounting for just 9% of total volume but over 100 basis points of the year-over-year price increase the $4 million increase in selling and marketing costs represents the ongoing return to pre-COVID levels of spend, consistent with our growth strategy and reflects the anniversary of reductions made last spring. With OEE flat to prior year, still impressive 88%, the total Siding transformation impact is $81 million in revenue and $50 million in EBITDA. 
Costs associated with the Holt conversion are making their first appearance in this waterfall with $1 million incurred in the second quarter. We have the last vestiges of the discontinued fiber sales this quarter with $10 million less revenue but only $1 million less EBITDA. This brings us to second quarter revenue for the segment of $291 million, an increase of 32% and and EBITDA of $77 million, an increase of 51% from an EBITDA margin for the segment of 27%. 
Slide 10 shows the quarter in more detail for OSB and is obviously not to scale as OSB price increases dwarf the other elements of the waterfall, adding $554 million in year-over-year revenue and EBITDA. Volume was up about 8%, driven by Structural Solutions growth. High unscheduled downtime reduced OEE to 86%, which contributed to the $18 million of unfavorable production costs. The OSB segment was elected by input and freight cost inflation. 
And lastly, the restart of Peace Valley cost us $7 million in the quarter. The net result of these factors dominated, as I said, by price, or increases in sales and EBITDA of $574 million and $519 million, respectively, and yet another quarter of extraordinary cash flow generation. As Brad mentioned and as you've all seen, supply chain interruptions are impacting many industries. In some cases, those disruptions impact building products specifically and in others. The impact is more widespread, particularly when it involves precursor materials consumed upstream by our suppliers or their suppliers. 
Freight demand has also increased, driving costs higher. All of which is reflective Siding and OSB waterfall charts to the tune of $8 million for raw materials and $12 million for freight across the 2 segments. Recall that last year saw significant drops in the same cost categories from which the housing industry benefited while demand elsewhere dropped. Now as the broader economic recovery is underway, raw material prices have flattened and our climate. 
On a blended unit cost basis, non-wood raw materials were down about 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, but are now up about 13% in 2021 compared to 2020. This represents an inflationary CAGR or compound annual growth rate of about 4% over the period. We expect inflationary pressures to continue and they are reflected in our third quarter guidance. 
One potential contributor to supply chain concerns are the fires in British Columbia and elsewhere in the West. So far, our employees and facilities are safe, and we've seen minimal interruptions to inbound and outbalance shipping. We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely with safety as our highest priority. 
Let me turn to LP's capital allocation strategy, which remains to return to shareholders over time, at least 50% of cash flow from operations in excess of investments required to sustain our core businesses and grow Siding Solutions at OSB Structural Solutions. In the second quarter of 2021, we returned $481 million to shareholders through a combination of $465 million in share repurchases and $16 million in dividends. 
Furthermore, since the end of June, we've spent an additional $140 million on buybacks, which leaves $572 million remaining under the current $1 billion authorization. And since LP embarked on its strategic transformation, we've returned over $1.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing more than 5 million shares and bringing the current share count to a bit under $95 million. 
In order to consistently reflect ongoing siting growth and the decrease in share count driven by aggressive share repurchases, LP has declared a midyear increase in the quarterly dividend of 13% or $0.02 per share, raising it from $0.16 a share to $0.18 per share. 
Slide 13 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the third quarter. We now anticipate spending $95 million in 2021 for the Houlton conversion, an increase of $10 million of prior guidance, largely due to increased costs for steel and labor. The remainder of the project costs will be incurred in early 2022. 
Spending for other growth capital is expected to be $45 million, and we anticipate spending about $120 million on sustaining maintenance for full year total capital outlay of $270 million. This assumes continued easing of travel restrictions and contractor availability, the reversal of which could result in some execution risk, which brings me to the revenue and EBITDA outlook. 
For Siding Solutions, the third quarter should see year-over-year revenue growth of around 10%, which would be another quarterly record despite the much stronger comparative. This will, however, bring the business very near to full production capacity with the result that revenue growth for the remainder of the year will be primarily driven by price increases and mix shifts. And if we assume 10% year-over-year revenue growth for the second half of this year, Siding Solutions revenue growth will hit 24% for the year, which is double our long-term guidance. However, the combined effects of the [indiscernible] conversion at other growth projects, increased selling and marketing investment and input cost inflation will result in third quarter EBITDA being below last year's. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we still expect the EBITDA margin to meet our long-term guidance of 25%. 
For the OSB segment, although prices are exceptionally volatile right now, our order file gives us some near-term visibility. We also tend to lag price movements, both when they are rising and when they are falling. We're therefore guiding to OSB revenue being roughly 10% sequentially lower than the second quarter. This includes the assumption that [indiscernible] prices stay flat from last Friday's print throughout the remainder of the quarter. And while this is obviously not a prediction of future OSB prices, we hope it's a useful characterization of the impact of price movements so far. 
And so with further caveats about certain changes in demand, raw material price and availability or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the third quarter to be at least $530 million. which will not be another quarterly record for LP, but will be second 1 to the quarter we've just finished to report it. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we've been working really with allocated order file since late last year. And so we've done a really good job of interacting with customers, understanding their order needs early in the process in producing to those orders and then allocating that volume across our entire network. And given our ability to grow the volume even under that managed order file scenario, I think we've done a really good job of meeting our customers' needs. I'll say what hasn't happened, John, is our customers have been unable as we have been to reap to build any kind of safety stock or extra inventory either at our build locations or in the channel. We've been running and our customers have been running so tight. 
So I feel good about our ability to provide product into the market. What we haven't been able to do since we -- the COVID would shut down in Q2 of last year, is build safety stock and any extra inventory in the channel. And so even though the quarter-over-quarter growth moderates. We're still selling a high volume side. So I feel good about our ability to source the market until we get the whole mill up and running, supplying extra mix for production. And I don't believe, at least at our distributor level that there's any significant substitution going on. I think we've got a really good focus on making sure we supply the distributors, the SKUs they need the source to provide product in their local markets. 
If there's any substitution happening, it would be deeper in the supply chain than we deal directly with if there is product shortages at the build or a contract level. But based on our growth, I feel really good about meeting the level of demand that our product is enjoying in the marketplace right now with supply. And it will be a little bit restricted to growth now year-over-year growth until we get Holton up and running. But when you look at the step change we've made in volume that's going into the market on a quarterly basis, I feel really good about where we're at."

We have seen that certainly with our retail pools. We're a little less exposed there than some of our competitors, but we still -- given our scale, we supply a good bit of volume into retail. That has been very weak. I mean, I'll tell you about half of what we think would be normal right now. 
Some of that may be related to the 4th of July holiday season. But I do think especially when you compare it to the prior 12 months or so on the consumer dollar maybe going other places than the wood products aisle at Home Depot and Lowe's versus what was happening a year ago. 
So we see weakness there. We have really not seen weakness in demand for our -- for the rest of our channel partners. But candidly, there is some hesitancy in distribution now to take any kind of serious position given the fall in OSB pricing. There obviously, expecting that maybe they could buy it cheaper next week than they do this week. So what we're feeling in our water file is distributors just buying to meet very short-term needs to just replenishment type orders. There's not a lot of enthusiasm in the distribution channel to build any excess inventory given where pricing is. 
So even though some of those retail pools were weak, which makes commodity volume available because of the pricing falls, there's hesitancy and distribution to build inventory given the fact that it could be cheaper next week. So my basic -- let me summarize the question -- the answer to your question this way. Certainly, we can confirm the weaknesses with retail pools -- But given the underlying strength in housing and really repair and remodel indices as well. We feel good about demand that exists in distribution, but there is a hesitancy to buy given the recent trends in pricing."

John, we do feel good about our decision there. Obviously, it's a little questionable given the pricing movements since we started to build up. But if you look at underlying housing start forecast, and we feel good about [ 1.5 to 1.6 ] being at least a near-term view of where housing starts are going to land. And if you work the math on that, the industry is going to need that production. That's the reason we started it up. 
I just want to reiterate all things that we have said in past, we did not start. We did not plan or star piece only because of the current price at the time of the decision, we started to be tiny up because we felt like the long-term outlook for the housing was strong enough where we needed that mill to meet our customer demand. And we still feel good about that decision and we feel good about the near-term outlook for housing, the near term being several years into the future. 
So we plan to continue to run that mill feed it up going because we really believe that, that volume is going to be needed with our channel partners next year.

And typically, we're able to help in some of that as prices start falling, kind of like OSB prices in way it lags. So in the near term, we feel good about pricing there. But obviously, as input prices continue to fall, there will be competitive pressure absorbed in our EWP segment as we go forward. this competitive pressure to maintain some rates of reasonable margin level. 
In South America, it's a really interesting market down there. typically, in our 20 years of experience, OSB pricing is much more stable. And while we've enjoyed good pricing down there this year, it's not been the magnitude of price increase that we've seen in the states. So -- but obviously, the kind of pricing we've seen in North America has influenced or make the ability to get pricing in South America a little easier. But if you look at the past that it's been a lot stickier as well. 
So we're in new territory given the magnitude of the price change in North America last year. So it's kind of hard to predict what that for South America. But I will say in the past, we've been able to really maintain pricing once we've been able to get it up. But I do feel like at some point, there could be some competitive pressure down there. imports from North America are able to go down there if pricing falls a lot. But I think for the near term, several quarters, we're in really good shape from a margin standpoint in South America. 
And let me just make 1 other comment there. We're also running that operations probably as good as we had in 2 or 3 years operationally. So our cost position down there other than there has been raw material price increases, but our mill system is running as well as it has in a long time. And we're doing some investments down there to make it even better. So the midterm outlook for our South America business is really good."

And so the growth has been phenomenal. It has stretched our capacity in pre-finish Fortunately, and that's part of this sustaining growth capital that Alan talked to on the slide. The incremental investment required there is in the world of OSB and Siding conversions is relatively small. We're learning kind of the technology that we want to utilize in our pre-finish. If you recall, our first 2, 4 ways were through acquisitions and those acquired companies had different paint systems in place. So we're in the process of standardizing that across our platform.

And we -- I think we said last year in our Investor Day and our long-term target is 30% of our mix being prefinished. And let me describe a little bit how we see that playing out over the next several years. So we have gone na",370,"Yes, that's a good question. And we -- I think we said last year in our Investor Day and our long-term target is 30% of our mix being prefinished. And let me describe a little bit how we see that playing out over the next several years. So we have gone national -- let me just say, the caveat that primarily focused in the East. So we do have expanding in the West with a standard color palette of 11 or 12 colors under our export finished brand that we feel like makes us a very attractive partner for regional and national one-step distributors and 2-step distributors. So this is a national play with a standard color set that backed by the LP brand that we think really positions us well to grow prefinished. 
Now behind that in the East, there's always going to be a market for custom colors and even some SKUs that we manufacture prime, we're not prefinishing. So what we're working through is partnering with the local prefinishers to be that supply partner that's able to do the custom color, I'll say, is primarily niche they can fill for us. 
And in some cases, those prefinishers are actually selling our 11, 12 standard colors in supplementing their production -- supplementing that with their production with the custom colors. In the West, right now, we're pretty much -- all of that as being expert finish and all of the custom colors are being serviced by independent prefinishers. So -- but in the East, we're trying to keep all that export finished production in-house. 
So the -- so I could see it playing out to where we have a big national network and good manufacturing around expert finish, [indiscernible] national market, but always have some position with local prefinishers that are doing custom colors on our substrate. 
And I'll just -- 1 other caveat to that answer is I also think there will also be pre-finishers that choose just to independently prefinish our prime product under their brand name and sell that as well. The substrate is so easy and such a good substrate the paint that it currently is a substrate of choice for the independent prefinisher."

One was where we are pretty much automating the manufacturer of SmartSide Shape product. We're putting that capability in our plant in Manitoba, make it will be highly productive. Shakes are 1 of the most highest margin products that we manufacture. We're excited about that capital project that capital project for memory is about half of that $45 million too. It's was a high -- relatively high cost finishing the investment but very high margin in returns. 
Secondly, automating our 3-dimensional corners. So we're taking [indiscernible] and making corner pieces. So think of it as a 3-dimensional corner pages. So that capital is as part of our innovative growth. And then I've talked about prefinish as well. 
Now on the second part of your question about how do we invest beyond Houlton extra productivity. First of all, there's some environmental projects, 1 of which we got approved in this past Board meeting that frees up some capacity that was otherwise limited because of permitting levels in 1 of our mills in Michigan. But also, we're really looking at -- under this managed order file situation of running kind of -- what is optimal mix look like within a production facility and running -- if we're able to optimize the productivity around so that we get more volume out, obviously, we're able to service the market with more volume. 
So we're really working with our customers to make sure we can understand what their SKU needs are. And then we can work with them in a way to optimize our production footprint it allows us to get, and let's just say, 1% or 2% we're talking about siding growth, 1% or 2% incremental volume out that could be really meaningful in a quarter. So -- and that is an all hands on deck initiative right now within our Siding business, given the fact that we will be capacity constrained probably up until Q2 of next year when Houlton's up and running with some respectability. 
So let me just back up a little bit and summarize the answer this way. The strategic capital other than mill conversions for Siding are either focused on product innovation, and typically for very high-return SKUs that we manufacture or to tweak productivity so that we can get more out of our current system, and we feel good about our ability to do that over the next several quarters to support the growth that we're seeing in our Siding business."

It's a topic of conversation in almost all meetings where we interact with our Siding team. I mean, obviously, we tried to have to over the years to be consistent in our price increases that we brought out to the market. Input cost does inform the decision there. The historical guidance that we've given around margin deforms that decision as well. And historically, in years of high raw material price increases, we have been able to realize higher pricing. I'm just talking about it historically. 
Now as Paul mentioned, we're in a very competitive environment from both from vinyl and from other hard Sidings. And so there is certainly a competitive positioning component of our pricing strategy, that can be SKU-specific and regionally specific and channel specific. So while we have -- while the pricing discussion is formed by raw material price escalation, that is only 1 factor that goes into our overall strategy about how to price each of our SKUs in each of our selling regions. So Ketan, does that answer your question or provide some color on how we think about it?"

We believe LDL and I-Joist together with under [indiscernible] brand. We know there's value there to our channel partners, many of which also our channel partners inside and structural solutions. So that's probably causing making us go a little bit longer as far as evaluating options because we do feel like there's some value to our channel partner by holding the business together versus keeping selling each individual plan 1 by one.

Thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the second quarter of 2021. Q2 was another remarkable quarter for LP Building Solutions. All our segments set records for sales and EBITDA in the second quarter with over 150,000 housing starts in June, single-family mix over 70% and repair and remodel indices equally robust, we are encouraged that demand for LP's products remain very strong.  
As you will see on Slide 6 of the accompanying presentation, net sales for Q2 reached $1.3 billion, more than 140% over Q2 of last year, which was, of course, a weak comp due to the onset of COVID-19. EBITDA was $684 million, generating $457 million in operating cash flow and $4.74 in earnings per share.
Siding Solutions growth is a significant component of these results as Slide 7 illustrates. Siding Solutions includes primed and prefinished SmartSide as well as innovative strand-based Siding products sold under other brand names. Revenue for Siding Solutions grew by 39% compared to last year. This is composed of 27% volume growth compounded by 9% price growth.
In addition to market penetration and share gains, Siding is growing through product innovation, the most innovative and value-added subset of Siding Solutions, which includes SmartSide Smooth, Shakes and ExpertFinish and LP's new builder series Siding combined for 9% of total volume in Q2. This is compared to 6% last year, and these new products contributed more than 1 point to the 9% increase.  
For LP's OSB segment, extraordinary prices generated impressive cash flows but also overshadowed important gains in Structural Solutions volume. OSB prices have pulled back in recent weeks. We have not wavered from our strategy of growing structural solutions and supply market demand agility. In fact, in Q2, we grew Structural Solutions as a percentage of total OSB volume by 5 points compared to prior year quarter.  
While not driving our strategy, OSB prices do, of course, continue to be a significant driver of LP's cash flow and share repurchases, about which Alan will update you in a few minutes. LP South America segment also had a very strong quarter with OSB and Siding price increases more than offsetting raw material cost inflation. South American sales almost doubled and EBITDA tripled compared to last year.  
Let me briefly update you on our capacity expansion projects, beginning with the Siding conversion in hold. While material costs particularly still have been subject to inflationary pressures, the project is on schedule. We expect to begin SmartSide production in Houlton in late Q1 of 2022. We continue to work to accelerate the Sagola conversion, and we are currently planning to start SmartSide production there in the first quarter of 2023.  
Finally, we are implementing projects to optimize our production and distribution processes that should result in incremental gains in production capacity across our mills. As for LP's Peace Valley OSB mill, I'm happy to announce that Peace Valley pressed its first Board of OSB in late June. We have received APA Certification in our shipping product, including TechShield Radiant Barrier, a significant contributor to Structural Solutions growth. I want to thank the team that maintained Peace Valley so diligently while it was idled, congratulate them and everyone else that contributed to the safe and efficient resumption of production at Peace Valley.  
In previous quarterly calls, I have discussed shortages of resin and adhesives as well as LP's operational responses to mitigate the impacts of these disruptions. As the broader economy continues this on even recovery, we expect intermittent supply chain challenges to continue. LP's Strategic Sourcing teams is working diligently to minimize disruptions. This includes collaborating with our operations teams to allocate any scarce inputs consistent with our transformation strategy as we did with MDI resin in the first quarter.  
Most categories of the raw materials LP consumed saw significant price decreases in 2020 as demand fell in sectors of the economy more severely impacted by COVID than housing. Many of those sectors are now rebounding with the result, the demand and therefore, prices are increasing. In some cases, availability has been hampered by supply chain interruptions elsewhere, as was the case with certain resins. Raw material prices are now back at 2019 levels or in some cases, above. Consumer and producer price indices generally trend upward. The situation is fluid, but we expect these inflationary pressures to persist for some time as the U.S. economy recovers and grows.
Before I turn the call over to Alan to review our financial performance in more detail, I want to briefly preview some planned enhancements to LP's ESG disclosures. We recently completed environmental product declaration for SmartSide Siding. We believe that SmartSide looks and performs better than competing alternatives. We also believe the data shows that SmartSide is significantly more sustainable with a much smaller carbon footprint. In coming quarters, we plan to disclose additional information under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB framework. Sustainability is central to our transformation strategy at LP. We believe we have a good story to tell, and we look forward to telling it.
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results in Q2, an update on our share repurchases and our outlook for Q3."
286119,1673768680,2361019,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning. As Brad has already said, all segments set new records for revenue and EBITDA in the second quarter. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 39% and OSB and EWP prices were significantly higher in both North and South America. In",1368,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning. As Brad has already said, all segments set new records for revenue and EBITDA in the second quarter. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 39% and OSB and EWP prices were significantly higher in both North and South America. In fact, sales for EWP and LPSA doubled compared to last year, with their combined EBITDA more than triple. And Entekra delivered a record 324 units for $22 million of revenue, a tenfold increase over last year. As a result, LP generated $1.3 billion in sales, $684 million of EBITDA, $457 million of operating cash flow and $4.74 in adjusted earnings per share.  
Page 8 of the presentation summarizes the year-over-year comparisons for revenue and EBITDA at a high level. Inflationary pressures in wages, raw materials and freight, especially when compared to softer prices last year, produced an EBITDA headwind of $24 million. Maintenance and other spending account for the remaining adverse $31 million.
The waterfalls on Slides 9 and 10 show year-over-year revenue and EBITDA comparisons for the Siding and OSB segments. Siding Solutions saw volume growth of 27% and price growth of 9% for revenue growth of 39%. This generated an additional $81 million of revenue and $53 million of EBITDA and incremental EBITDA margin of 65%. Notably, the 9% price increase in the quarter includes 4 percentage points from annual list price increases and 3 points on the packet, that is from reduced discounts and rebates. 
The highest value-added subset of products, which includes ExpertFinish, Smooth, Shakes and Builder series punches well above its weight in terms of price, accounting for just 9% of total volume but over 100 basis points of the year-over-year price increase. The $4 million increase in selling and marketing costs represents the ongoing return to pre-COVID levels of spend, consistent with our growth strategy and reflects the anniversary of reductions made last spring. With OEE flat to prior year, still impressive 88%, the total Siding transformation impact is $81 million in revenue and $50 million in EBITDA.  
Costs associated with the Houlton conversion are making their first appearance in this waterfall with $1 million incurred in the second quarter. We have the last vestiges of the discontinued fiber sales this quarter with $10 million less revenue but only $1 million less EBITDA. This brings us to second quarter revenue for the segment of $291 million, an increase of 32% and EBITDA of $77 million, an increase of 51% for an EBITDA margin for the segment of 27%.  
Slide 10 shows the quarter in more detail for OSB and is obviously not to scale as OSB price increases dwarfed the other elements of the waterfall, adding $554 million in year-over-year revenue and EBITDA. Volume was up about 8%, driven by Structural Solutions growth. High unscheduled downtime reduced OEE to 86%, which contributed to the $18 million of unfavorable production costs. The OSB segment was also impacted by input and freight cost inflation.
And lastly, the restart of Peace Valley cost us $7 million in the quarter. The net result of these factors dominated, as I said, by price, are increases in sales and EBITDA of $574 million and $519 million, respectively, and yet another quarter of extraordinary cash flow generation. As Brad mentioned and as you've all seen, supply chain interruptions are impacting many industries. In some cases, those disruptions impact building products specifically and in others, the impact is more widespread, particularly when it involves precursor materials consumed upstream by our suppliers or their suppliers.  
Freight demand has also increased, driving costs higher. All of which is reflected in the Siding and OSB waterfall charts to the tune of $8 million for raw materials and $12 million for freight across the 2 segments. Recall that last year saw significant drops in the same cost categories from which the housing industry benefited while demand elsewhere dropped. Now as the broader economic recovery is underway, raw material prices have flattened and are climbing.
On a blended unit cost basis, non-wood raw materials were down about 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, but are now up about 13% in 2021 compared to 2020. This represents an inflationary CAGR or compound annual growth rate of about 4% over the period. We expect inflationary pressures to continue and they are reflected in our third quarter guidance.  
One potential contributor to supply chain concerns are the fires in British Columbia and elsewhere in the West. So far, our employees and facilities are safe, and we've seen minimal interruptions to inbound and outbound shipping. We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely with safety as our highest priority.
Let me turn to LP's capital allocation strategy, which remains to return to shareholders over time, at least 50% of cash flow from operations in excess of investments required to sustain our core businesses and grow Siding Solutions at OSB Structural Solutions. In the second quarter of 2021, we returned $481 million to shareholders through a combination of $465 million in share repurchases and $16 million in dividends.  
Furthermore, since the end of June, we've spent an additional $140 million on buybacks, which leaves $572 million remaining under the current $1 billion authorization. And since LP embarked on its strategic transformation, we've returned over $1.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing more than 5 million shares and bringing the current share count to a bit under 95 million.
In order to consistently reflect ongoing Siding growth and the decrease in share count driven by aggressive share repurchases, LP has declared a midyear increase in the quarterly dividend of 13% or $0.02 per share, raising it from $0.16 a share to $0.18 per share.  
Slide 13 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the third quarter. We now anticipate spending $95 million in 2021 for the Houlton conversion, an increase of $10 million of prior guidance, largely due to increased costs for steel and labor. The remainder of the project costs will be incurred in early 2022.  
Spending for other growth capital is expected to be $45 million, and we anticipate spending about $120 million on sustaining maintenance for full year total capital outlay of $270 million. This assumes continued easing of travel restrictions and contractor availability, the reversal of which could result in some execution risk, which brings me to the revenue and EBITDA outlook.
For Siding Solutions, the third quarter should see year-over-year revenue growth of around 10%, which would be another quarterly record despite the much stronger comparative. This will, however, bring the business very near to full production capacity with the result that revenue growth for the remainder of the year will be primarily driven by price increases and mix shifts. And if we assume 10% year-over-year revenue growth for the second half of this year, Siding Solutions revenue growth will hit 24% for the year, which is double our long-term guidance. However, the combined effects of the Houlton conversion and other growth projects, increased selling and marketing investment and input cost inflation will result in third quarter EBITDA being below last year's. But on a trailing 12-month basis, we still expect the EBITDA margin to meet our long-term guidance of 25%.
For the OSB segment, although prices are exceptionally volatile right now, our order file gives us some near-term visibility. We also tend to lag price movements, both when they are rising and when they are falling. We're therefore guiding to OSB revenue being roughly 10% sequentially lower than the second quarter. This includes the assumption that Random Lengths prices stay flat from last Friday's print throughout the remainder of the quarter. And while this is obviously not a prediction of future OSB prices, we hope it's a useful characterization of the impact of price movements so far.  
And so with further caveats about certain changes in demand, raw material price and availability or other unforeseeable events, we expect EBITDA for the third quarter to be at least $530 million, which will not be another quarterly record for LP, but will be second only to the quarter we've just finished to report it.  
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

So we've been working really with allocated order file since late last year. And so we've done a really good job of interacting with customers, understanding their order needs early in the process and then producing to those orders and then allocating that volume across our entire network. And given our ability to grow the volume even under that managed order file scenario, I think we've done a really good job of meeting our customers' needs. I'll say what hasn't happened, John, is our customers have been unable -- as we have been to reap to build any kind of safety stock or extra inventory either at our build locations or in the channel. We've been running fast, and our customers have been running so tight. 
So I feel good about our ability to provide product into the market. What we haven't been able to do since we -- the COVID shut down in Q2 of last year, is build safety stock and any extra inventory in the channel. And so even though the quarter-over-quarter growth moderates, we're still selling a high volume side. So I feel good about our ability to source the market until we get the whole mill up and running, supplying extra mix for production. And I don't believe, at least at our distributor level that there's any significant substitution going on. I think we've got a really good focus on making sure we supply the distributors, the SKUs they need, the source to provide product in their local markets. 
If there's any substitution happening, it would be deeper in the supply chain than we deal directly with if there is product shortages at the build or contract level. But based on our growth, I feel really good about meeting the level of demand that our product is enjoying in the marketplace right now with supply. And it will be a little bit restricted to growth now year-over-year growth until we get Houlton up and running. But when you look at the step change we've made in volume that's going into the market on a quarterly basis, I feel really good about where we're at."

We have seen that certainly with our retail pools. We're a little less exposed there than some of our competitors, but we still -- given our scale, we supply a good bit of volume into retail. That has been very weak. I mean, I'll tell you about half of what we think would be normal right now. 
Some of that may be related to the 4th of July holiday season. But I do think especially when you compare it to the prior 12 months or so on the consumer dollar maybe going other places than the wood products aisle at Home Depot and Lowe's versus what was happening a year ago. 
So we see weakness there. We have really not seen weakness in demand for the rest of our channel partners. But candidly, there is some hesitancy in distribution now to take any kind of serious position given the fall in OSB pricing. There obviously, expecting that maybe they could buy it cheaper next week than they do this week. So what we're feeling in our order file is distributors just buying to meet very short-term needs to just replenishment type orders. There's not a lot of enthusiasm in the distribution channel to build any excess inventory given where pricing is. 
So even though some of those retail pools were weak, which makes commodity volume available because of the pricing falls, there's hesitancy in distribution to build inventory given the fact that it could be cheaper next week. So my basic -- let me summarize the question -- the answer to your question this way. Certainly, we can confirm the weaknesses with retail pools. But given the underlying strength in housing and really repair and remodel indices as well, we feel good about demand that exists in distribution, but there is a hesitancy to buy given the recent trends in pricing."

But if you look at underlying housing start forecast, and we feel good about 1.5 million units to 1.6 million units being at least a near-term view of where housing starts are going to land. And if you work the math on that, the industry is going to need that production. That's the reason we started it up.

At the time of the decision, we started Peace Valley because we felt like the long-term outlook for the housing was strong enough where we needed that mill to meet our customer demand. And we still feel good about that decision and we feel good about the near-term outlook for housing, the near term being several years into the future. 
So we plan to continue to run that mill, feed it up and going because we really believe that, that volume is going to be needed with our channel partners next year. And I'll just say that decision has been -- was very much supported by our channel partners as they plan out for the next several quarters that they see a need for that volume, and we're glad. So we're not backing off of that decision at all."

It's not a traded product, it is our product sale other than we do sell supply within that segment, but we just based on our handout. LVL and I-joist are -- announced our sort of price list. We've done a good job with us -- with our margins there given the price inflation on the input material, which is lumber, OSB and veneer.
And typically, we're able to hold on to some of that as prices start falling, kind of like OSB prices in way of lags. So in the near term, we feel good about pricing there. But obviously, as input prices continue to fall, there will be competitive pressure absorbed in our EWP segment as we go forward. This competitive pressure to maintain some rates of reasonable margin level. 
In South America, it's a really interesting market down there. typically, in our 20 years of experience, OSB pricing is much more stable. And while we've enjoyed good pricing down there this year, it's not been the magnitude of price increase that we've seen in the states. So -- but obviously, the kind of pricing we've seen in North America has influenced our innate ability to get pricing in South America a little easier. But if you look at the past that it's been a lot stickier as well. 
So we're in new territory given the magnitude of the price change in North America over the past year. So it's kind of hard to predict what that comes -- what shadows for South America. But I will say in the past, we've been able to really maintain pricing once we've been able to get it up. But I do feel like at some point, there could be some competitive pressure down there if imports from North America are able to go down there if pricing falls a lot. But I think for the near term, several quarters, we're in really good shape from a margin standpoint in South America. 
And let me just make 1 other comment there. We're also running that operations probably as good as we had in 2 or 3 years operationally. So our cost position down there other than -- there has been raw material price increases, but our mill system is running as well as it has in a long time. And we're doing some investments down there to make it even better. So the midterm outlook for our South America business is really good."

We did -- we viewed that with our Board last week and got approval for continued expansion of our prefinished capacity, both within some of the facilities that we currently manufacture and we're looking at growth in the Northeast. So we're actively looking for a location there to start up a prefinished operation to service our Northeast segment in conjunction with the Houlton expansion or Houlton conversion. 
And so the growth has been phenomenal. It has stretched our capacity in prefinish fortunately, and that's part of this sustaining growth capital that Alan talked to on the slide. The incremental investment required there is -- in the world of OSB and siding conversions is relatively small. We're learning kind of the technology that we want to utilize in our prefinish. If you recall, our first 2 forays were through acquisitions and those 2 acquired companies had different paint systems in place.  So we're in the process of standardizing that across our platform.
And as I mentioned, having the greenfield facility in Northeast. So there'll be continued investment in prefinish as we grow it. So we should be talking about that many years to come, and we're well on our way to our second phase there. We -- I will say the acquisition strategy that we had that was really testing our ability to make a product, sell a product and market a product.

Probably more detail than you're looking for in that answer, so forgive me. But that is something that we have looked at. 
We decided to focus in other areas. We didn't see that as for our trials being a big opportunity for us. But as you know, in certain regions of the country, stucco is a predominant siding. And I would say, we are not in a position right now to capitalize on that. We're way more focused on the prefinish and ancillary products around prefinish like corner pieces and that kind of thing.

And we -- I think we said last year in our Investor Day our long-term target is 30% of our mix being prefinish. And let me describe a little bit how we see that playing out over the next several years. So we have gone national",372,"Yes, that's a good question. And we -- I think we said last year in our Investor Day our long-term target is 30% of our mix being prefinish. And let me describe a little bit how we see that playing out over the next several years. So we have gone national -- let me just say, the caveat that primarily focused in the East. So we do have -- we are expanding in the West with a standard color palette of 11 or 12 colors under our ExpertFinish brand that we feel like makes us a very attractive partner for regional and national one-step distributors and 2-step distributors. So this is a national play with a standard color set that backed by the LP brand that we think really positions us well to grow prefinish.
Now behind that in the East, there's always going to be a market for custom colors and even some SKUs that we manufacture prime, we're not prefinish. So what we're working through is partnering with the local prefinishers to be that supply partner that's able to do the custom color, I'll say, is primarily niche that can fill for us. 
And in some cases, those prefinishers are actually selling our 11, 12 standard colors in supplementing their production -- supplementing that with their production with the custom colors. In the West, right now, we're pretty much -- all of that as being -- all our ExpertFinish and all other custom colors are being serviced by independent prefinishers. So -- but in the East, we're trying to keep all that ExpertFinish production in-house. 
So the -- so I could see it playing out to where we have a big national network and good manufacturing around ExpertFinish to supply the national market, but always have some position with local prefinishers that are doing custom colors on our substrate. 
And I'll just -- 1 other caveat to that answer is I also think there will also be prefinishers that choose just to independently prefinish our prime product under their brand name and sell that as well. The substrate is so easy and such a good substrate to paint that it currently is a substrate of choice for the independent prefinisher."

One was where we are pretty much automating the manufacturer of SmartSide Shape product. We're putting that capability in our plant in Manitoba, maybe it will be highly productive. Shakes are 1 of the most highest priced -- highest margin products that we manufacture. We're excited about that capital project. That capital project from memory is about half of that $45 million too. It's was a high -- relatively high cost finishing in the investment but very high margin in returns.
Secondly, automating our 3-dimensional corners. So we're taking Trim and making corner pieces. So think of it as a 3-dimensional corner piece. So that capital is  part of our innovative growth. And then I've talked about prefinish as well. 
Now on the second part of your question about how do we invest beyond Houlton for extra productivity. First of all, there's some environmental projects, 1 of which we got approved in this past Board meeting that frees up some capacity that was otherwise limited because of permitting levels in 1 of our mills in Michigan. But also, we're really looking at -- under this managed order file situation of running kind of optimal mix look like within a production facility and running -- if we're able to optimize the productivity around so that we get more volume out, obviously, we're able to service the market with more volume. 
So we're really working with our customers to make sure we can understand what their SKU needs are. And then we can work with them in a way to optimize our production footprint if it allows us to get, and let's just say, 1% or 2% we're talking about siding growth, 1% or 2% incremental volume out that could be really meaningful in a quarter. So -- and that is an all hands on deck initiative right now within our siding business, given the fact that we will be capacity constrained probably up until Q2 of next year when Houlton's up and running with some respectability.
So let me just back up a little bit and summarize the answer this way. The strategic capital other than mill conversions for siding are either focused on product innovation, and typically for very high-return SKUs that we manufacture or to tweak productivity so that we can get more out of our current system, and we feel good about our ability to do that over the next several quarters to support the growth that we're seeing in our siding business."

I mean, obviously, we tried over the years to be consistent in our price increases that we brought out to the market. Input cost does inform the decision there. The historical guidance that we've given around margin deforms that decision as well. And historically, Ketan, in years of high raw material price increases, we have been able to realize higher pricing. I'm just talking about it historically.
Now as Paul mentioned, we're in a very competitive environment from both from vinyl and from other hard sidings. And so there is certainly a competitive positioning component of our pricing strategy, that can be SKU-specific and regionally specific and channel specific. So while we have -- while the pricing discussion is informed by raw material price escalation, that is only 1 factor that goes into our overall strategy about how to price each of our SKUs in each of our selling regions. So Ketan, does that answer your question or provide some color on how we think about it?"

The focus for us is to -- we are -- mean it would be easier if we didn't have somewhat of a self-imposed constraint, which we're trying to hold the system together. We believe LVL and I-Joist together went under Stark Truss brand. We know there's value there to our channel partners, many of which also our channel partners inside and structural solutions. So that's probably causing -- making us go a little bit longer as far as evaluating options because we do feel like there's some value to our channel partners by holding the business together versus keeping selling each individual plan one by one. So we're being somewhat selective on the options that we're looking at because of that desire of ours."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the third quarter of 2021. Despite a significant OSB price correction in the quarter and ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges, LP delivered its second best quarter ever. Siding sales grew at 19%, LP South America and EWP set all-time quarterly records, and the OSB business continued to generate impressive cash flows. In Entekra, our California-based offside advanced framing system business was gross profit positive in the quarter and continues to gain customer acceptance and operational momentum. Demand for LP's products remain robust, and our capacity expansion projects at Holton and Peace Valley are on schedule. We also strengthened our strategic relationships with key customers, including being named Partner of the Year in our category by -- The Home Depot. As you will see on Slide 5 of the presentation, sales for Siding Solutions increased by 19%. Another record quarter made possible by strong demand and exceptional performance by the Siding operations team. Siding efficiently produced and shipped over 430 million square feet and more importantly, they did so safely without a single recordable injury in the quarter. The fastest-growing components of the siding portfolio are innovative products like export finished prefinished siding, smooth siding and shapes. We shipped more than 4x the volume of those products compared to Q3 of last year. These newer products contributed significantly to the segment's price growth in the quarter. OSB sales were up over $230 million from last year, but down sequentially as OSB prices corrected early in the quarter. Since reaching the recent low in August, Random Lane's OSB prices have steadily increased, supported by consistently strong demand. The Engineered Wood Products segment had another record quarter with twice their sales revenue and more than 4x EBITDA for the same quarter last year. 
South America also had a very strong quarter with more stable OSB prices than seen in North America. Compared to Q3 of last year, sales in South America increased almost 70% and EBITDA more than tripled. As we have seen recently, LP South America is capable of significant cash flow generation, and we are reinvesting that cash in South America to grow capacity and improve OEE in order to stay ahead of steadily growing demand. The Siding conversion project at Holton remains on schedule, with production expected to begin in the first quarter of next year. The mill has discontinued production of eliminated strand lumber and OSB production will cease this week to begin the last phases of the conversion process. Inflationary pressures have impacted the Holton project somewhat, particularly the price of steel, but the long-term nature of material and labor contracts for the project have blended these inflationary pressures somewhat. I want to thank the team there for keeping the conversion process safe and on schedule. The Peace Sally restart has also gone exceptionally well. 
I'm grateful to the local mill leadership as well as the OSB operations and support functions for a safe and efficient restart. The mill is ahead of its planned ramp-up curve and produced just over 100 million square feet in Q3. 
With housing starts consensus, higher now than when we announced the restart, there's no question that the market needs the mills output. Peace Valley will also contribute to our Structural Solutions strategy as a significant producer of TechShield radiant barrier as we work to transform our portfolio away from commodity OSB to hire more constructural solutions. 
The resulting financial performance for Q3 is summarized on Page 6 of the presentation. LPs businesses generated a combined $1.2 billion in sales, $522 million in EBITDA and $3.87 in earnings per share. We returned over $400 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, all of it from free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.19 per share dividend. And as Alan will detail authorized a further $500 million for share repurchases. 
Supply chain interruptions and inflationary pressures are presenting headwinds. While we have benefited from higher OSB prices, some of those gains are now being offset by higher prices and tight availability for resins and freight where we have seen meaningful price increases. We are working to minimize these impacts by partnering with our suppliers, balancing costs and risks with agile inventory management and seeking alternative sources of supply where possible. 
I am proud of and confident in our strategic sourcing and operations teams as they navigate these challenges. I want to talk about how we are responding to these inflationary pressures. When faced with raw material scarcity, we have consistently allocated limited resources to the most strategic applications. Because our OSB business has maintained the flexibility to use various resin types, we've been able to ship MDI resins to siding in order to maintain production, product quality and growth. For freight, flatbed trucks are in tight supply, we have the ability to convert shipments from truck to rail, and we have our own small trucking fleet, both of which contributed to record siding shipments in the quarter. We can't predict the duration of the supply chain challenges, but our teams will continue to work diligently to minimize their impact. 
Before I turn the call over to Alan to review our financial performance in more detail, I want to announce 2 changes to LP's executive leadership team. First, Neil Sherman, who joined LP in 1994 and has served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP Siding business since January of 2017, will transition to lead Entekra as its President. Neil has done a tremendous job of growing LP siding business, and he is exactly the kind of leader in Entekra needs to reach its potential as an innovative and disruptive building technology. 
Second, Jason Ringblom, who joined LP in 2004 and has served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP's OSB and EWP businesses since January 2017 will succeed Neil as EVP and General Manager of the signing business. Jason has been instrumental in transforming LP's OSB business, increasing its operational agility and efficiency while shifting the focus from commodity products to value-added structural solutions. Jason is rejoining the Siding business, where he previously held a leadership position with our sales team. So he's very familiar with the SmartSide customer values and value proposition. Neil and Jason's leadership of Siding and OSB has been critically important to LP's ongoing strategic transformation. 
I am extremely grateful for their contributions, and I am confident they will continue to deliver outstanding results in their new roles. Both of them have built world-class teams that lead and execute their business strategies. And I know neither team will skip a beat during this transition. Both Jason and Neil will remain in their current roles for a brief transition period until we appoint a new EVP and General Manager for OSB and EWP, a process that we hope to complete soon. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for the third quarter as well as an update on our capital allocation strategy and our outlook for Q4 and the full year."

Before I dive into the financial results for the quarter, I'd like to add my personal thanks and congratulations to both Neil and Jason. LP's results for the past several quarters, even years are due in no small part to their leadership, and I'm confident they'll be equally impactful in their new roles. 
As Brad said, the third quarter of 2021 was LP's second best quarter ever. Page 7 of today's presentation summarizes these results compared to the third quarter of last year. Revenue increased by 53% from almost $800 million last year to $1.2 billion this year. Just over half of this increase, $225 million was the result of higher OSB prices. Siding added $49 million to which EWP, South America and Entekra collectively added a further $148 million in revenue. EBITDA increased by 90% year-over-year from $273 million to $522 million. OSB prices and Siding growth added $225 million and $31 million, respectively. South America and EWP added a further $60 million. 
However, inflation in wages, raw materials and freight costs increased by $58 million compared to last year's deflationary environment and costs for the Holton conversion and the Peace Valley restart totaled $10 million in the quarter. 
The waterfall on Slide 8 adds year-over-year revenue and EBITDA detail for the Siding segment. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 19%, with both volume and price increasing by 9% year-over-year. The Siding team shipped 432 million square feet of SmartSide in the third quarter made possible by a remarkably efficient production and shipping in response to unrelenting demand. And quite frankly, shipments of 432 million square feet in the quarter is more than we thought possible prior to the additional capacity of Holton coming online next year. 
On the cost side, we have accelerated our investments in selling and marketing after sharply curtailing them last year during COVID. We intend to continue investing at this rate in the fourth quarter and beyond to drive demand creation particularly for expert finish, in anticipation of the Holmen startup. OEE improved to 89% for a net transformation impact of $33 million in EBITDA. Inflation of raw materials, mostly resin and paper, added $18 million of costs and freight costs increased by $10 million. After running our mills at near maximum capacity for more than a year, we completed some necessary sustaining maintenance projects at a total cost of $7 million in the quarter. One such project that began at quarter end and is now almost complete, is a press rebuild at our siding mill in Swan Valley, Manitoba, the impact of which will mostly be felt in the fourth quarter. We also incurred $3 million of conversion costs at Houlton. The resulting EBITDA of $73 million is therefore down $3 million from 2020, bringing the quarterly EBITDA margin to 23% or 27% on a year-to-date basis. 
The chart on Slide 9 show that revenue for Siding solutions continues to grow faster than single-family housing starts on a trailing 12-month basis, with Siding revenue growing by 33%, while starts increased by 23%. The pie charts show continued growth in innovative Siding products like expert finish, smooth siding, shakes and corners. For the third quarter, these new higher value-added products made up 10% of siding volume, 15% of Siding revenue and contributed 3 points of the 9% price increases for the segment. 
Slide 10 shows the quarter in more detail for our OSB business. OSB prices fell steeply in the first weeks of the third quarter before stabilizing in August and are down sequentially from record highs. However, compared to last year, higher prices added $225 million of revenue and EBITDA. On our last quarterly call, we guided to OSB revenue being about 10% below the second quarter or around $700 million, provided that OSB prices remained steady at the levels published the previous Friday by Random Lengths. As we now know, of course, prices continue to fall from that point before rebounding. By quarter end, the actual average weekly Random Lengths price for [ 7 16 ] sheeting was approximately $100 lower than it would have been as prices remained flat after our last call. And at roughly 1 billion square feet of quarterly capacity, the $100 price difference would imply a revenue difference of about $100 million, yielding an adjusted estimate of about $600 million in revenue. which it turns out is precisely the result in third quarter revenue. Price again swamps other factors in the OSB waterfall, but I will address the other components briefly. Volume was up in the quarter due to production at Peace Valley offsetting the onetime costs associated with this restart. OEE in the quarter was down compared to the prior year, partly due to resin substitutions and partly due to maintenance and production issues, resulting in a $4 million hit to EBITDA. The same inflationary pressures we discussed for signing also impacted OSB with resin and freight inflation costing $15 million and $11 million in the quarter, respectively. 
I wouldn't normally point this out, but the freight variance is abnormally large this quarter, so I should note that whereas Siding is typically sold at delivered prices, freight costs in OSB are generally passed through. Therefore, the OSB freight cost increase in the quarter is offset within the price component with no net EBITDA impact. So OSB ended the quarter with $600 million in revenue, $381 million in EBITDA and another remarkable quarter of cash generation. 
And while not shown in waterfall charts, EWP and LP South America had remarkable quarters as well, with strong demand and pricing more than offsetting increases in raw material costs, which brings me to a summary of cash flows in the quarter and a capital allocation update. Operating cash flow was a little over $500 million in the third quarter. After $68 million in capital spending, we returned $416 million to shareholders, comprising $399 million in share repurchases and $17 million in dividends, and we ended the quarter with cash balances essentially unchanged. 
LP repurchased 6.8 million shares during the third quarter, ending the quarter with 90.2 million shares outstanding. As of yesterday, we have spent a further $156 million since quarter end to repurchase 2.5 million more shares. This brings the remaining balance of our $1 billion authorization to $157 million. And our current number of shares outstanding as of right now to slightly under $88 million. 
Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share and authorized a further $500 million for ongoing share repurchases, bringing our total repurchase authorization as of today to a little over $650 million. 
Slide 11 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter. We are lowering our full year CapEx guidance slightly to account for longer lead times and contractor availability issues. While Houghton remains on schedule, the completion of some of the smaller projects may unfortunately be pushed into early 2022. Raw materials and logistics, particularly flatbed freight, continue to exhibit tight supply and elevated prices. While we are currently able to procure all the resin and other raw materials that we need, inflationary pressures may dampen margins somewhat in the near term for all segments.
With respect to signing. On the last call, we guided to revenue growth of 10% for the second half of the year and a full year EBITDA margin of about 25%. Despite the business growing in the third quarter twice the rate necessary to hit that guidance, I'm reiterating both aspects of that guidance today. And here's why: While the price growth experienced in the third quarter is certainly sustainable, similar volume growth in the fourth quarter is unlikely simply because the much-needed maintenance projects, especially the press rebuild at Swan Valley have temporarily lowered production. The EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter would probably have been similar to that of the third quarter, with price increases once again offsetting raw material inflation, if not for 2 factors. The first is the lower production capacity. The lost volume has a high variable margin of around 50%. And the second is the cost of other investments we're making for future growth, increased selling and marketing, the Holton conversion, the Swan press rebuild and other critical maintenance and growth projects designed to derisk and debottleneck operations will add roughly $25 million of discretionary costs in the fourth quarter. Although these actions will result in an EBITDA lower than both the third quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, the resulting full year EBITDA margin still meets our long-term target of 25%, which was set at that level precisely because of the need to make periodic investments such as these. Now we're confident that these actions position the business very well for additional growth in 2022, particularly when Holton comes online. 
OSB is somewhat simpler with volume increases from Peace Valley, partially offsetting sequentially lower OSB prices. Provided the quarter-to-date average OSB price hold throughout the fourth quarter, the resulting OSB revenue will be down about 30% sequentially from the third quarter. So in conclusion, given the usual caveats about sudden changes in demand, unexpected changes in raw material price or availability or other unforeseeable factors, the resulting EBITDA for the fourth quarter should be somewhat above $200 million. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'll just remind the audience that we typically and are planning this year to time our price increase for January 1. And so we'll be communicating that later in November and December to the market. So we haven't gotten feedback on that. But we feel confident about our ability to get some pricing next year given the demand situation for the product. And then as we look into next year and the the margin profile, we're still guiding to 25%, and I think that's a good margin to -- for us to focus on next year. And we have a lot going on next year on the cost side with the completion and start-up of the Houlton mill and then we'll begin the Sagola process later in the years, and we've got some raw material headwinds, especially compared to where we were at the beginning of this year. But I think given our pricing strategy, given our consistently improving mix around pricing, I feel good about that 25% margin guidance for next year."

Really proud of the business improvement, really over the last 3 years, but particularly this year. Mark, there's no question, some of that margin is aided by the pricing, the world wide price OSB, the price the lowest being North America. You can imagine that imports to South America diminish from North America when we had the kind of pricing environment we had up here this year, which allows us to push price down there. I do think there is a ratchet up in performance in South America, but they will -- I do believe there will be some pricing moderation as we see the decline in pricing or experienced the decline in pricing in North America, but the magnitude of price increase and the magnitude of price decrease in South America historically has been a lot less volatile than what we've seen in North America, but I do think we should expect some moderation of margin down there. Now there is a component of that margin improvement, though, that is sustainable and that's operational OEE aspect of the business. That -- historically, that has been our poorest OEE division if you type crude siding in North American divisions or segments. They've made really good movement over the past year, and there's a lot of room for future improvement. And then we also have a pretty aggressive for the scale of that business, capital reinvestment strategy down there. We're primarily focused on improved machine reliability. And so there's room for us to continue to improve South America from a cost standpoint. And then I guess there's a little bit of latency on how pricing kind of gets into equilibrium. And I don't think we'll know that for a quarter or 2 in South America, but we'll obviously continue to report out on that. 
On Entekra. Entekra is very strategic to us. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made in that business over this past year, but I think that they're speaking a step change, Mark, there's a step change needed. I believe we have validated market acceptance. I've said that on this call before, but we really have to bring a level of confidence in to just the overall operations of that business and the delivery of the value proposition. So we made a couple of moves in the quarter. We -- one that we mentioned on the call, we did 1 of our very experienced plant managers into the Badesto facility is now the plant manager. And then as we talked about, we're moving Neil over there to be President. So we see this as a very significant strategic opportunity for us. We think the timing is right to really put some concentrated resources on it. Obviously, Neil has a great track record over his tenure in siding of growing that business and building a really strong team that was capable of doing that. And we want to kind of lift and place them over in Entekra to see the same kind of rapid business improvement. And then we're very blessed to have a strong bench. Jason spent portions of his career associated with, particularly, with the sales side of our siding business. So I feel really good about Jason's ability to continue the good performance in siding as well. So -- but it does -- I guess the nature of your question, what does this say about Entekra. It says that we see it as a huge opportunity, and we're really getting serious about getting a manufacturing competency so that we can continue to grow that business. We'll probably -- we'll have revenue in the business of around $100 million this year of Entekra. We're close to breakeven EBITDA, particularly in the second half of the year. So I mean, $100 million from 0, 18 months ago, does show that the revenue generation capacity of this business. And -- so we're excited about turning that into a growth engine that is creating value. And that's Neil's job is to get that done as quickly as possible."

There's 2 components to the growth in sales and marketing expense in siding and 1 of them is that we cut it pretty severely Q2 of last year. So some of that is just a recovery back to somewhat of a normal run rate that we had been on. we obviously cut at Q2 of last year thinking that would not be experiencing the reality of what the COVID impact on housing, but also just to calibrate us all, the prefinished strategy, the export finished strategy is 1 is very different from selling into new home construction. Ultimately, the decision is made on siding choice in the home with a home homeowner deeply involved in that. So it's a bit more of a consumer sale. And so our marketing expense is primarily focused about building brand identity around prefinished -- our export finished brand, supporting, repair and remodel, contractor base around making that sale and just getting that exposure and placement that we need to be a national presence as far as prefinish siding. So it is at a step historically with what we've done from a marketing percentage or marketing dollar standpoint, but very consistent with what is required in order to have an effective prepare and remodel present in siding. Now what part of your question was -- well, I think the nature of that question, John, was that we're oversold now, so is now the time to be spending it, we think so. It does take a little while to build the kind of brand credibility and with the investments we're making around capacity expansion, we do want to be ahead of that a little bit on the marketing side so that when Holton comes up, particularly on the East Coast, a big repair and remodel market. And then Sagola, following that, we've got some momentum on the sales and marketing side, the marketing side, in particular, to support that extra capacity. It's a judgment game, honestly, around how and when the magnitude of that marketing spend. But I feel like we do have a credible -- a very credible team that knows how to spend those dollars wisely. So I'm confident of that, but any mistake would be maybe we get ahead of it a little bit. But I do feel like it's a minimal investment compared to the size of the capacity expansion capital and makes a lot of sense, given our recent history of sales growth and our ability to support that kind of level of spend in support of the brand."

And we'll just have to see what the winter weather brings to the Gulf Coast, which has caused the problem last year with the freezers in Texas, but I would say right now, we're -- we feel good about where we're at, but we do know that any disruption in the supply chain could cause us to have to be very flexible. We're -- it's fortunate for us, and I think this is true, most OSB manufacturers, but we can convert from MDI to an for our commodity production and we have not had any issues related to securing phenolic resin. So we've got a good backup plan, though we would rather be running those mills with the MDI residents, particularly in support of our Structural Solutions growth."

I would say, obviously, given the pricing moderation, the last 3 months or so, there's been some -- some return to quasi-normal inventory levels. I would still characterize them as lean, if you look historically, but certainly not as long as it was 6 months ago. And so as we go into the winter, there's typically or historically a low between Thanksgiving and say, January -- the new year around building -- building new construction, multifamily construction stays strong. I could see the supply chain remaining on the lean side of normal. If we get a slowdown in construction over that period of time, which would typically be weather-related, if it happens, we could see more of a return to a normal inventory situation by the time we get to the new year. I don't see any scenario where the channel gets heavy with inventory, though. I think -- I just think there's too much catch-up to do given how we started this year for that to happen. And I think housing demand is too strong as well. But certainly, more -- there's more inventory available in the channel than there was 6 months ago, but I would just still call it on the lean side."

Before I turn the call over to Brad and Alan, I'm happy to announce that we published an environmental product declaration for SmartSide last week. We have known for years that SmartSide performs very well and looks great as the EPD demonstrates, it is also classified as carbon negative, making it exceptionally sustainable, especially when compared to alternative siding substrates. LP is also expected to publish its first ESG report later in November, including SASB disclosures. Sustainability is a core value at LP, and we're excited to share our story. The SmartSide EPD is available on LP's website, and our ESG report will be published soon.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the third quarter of 2021. Despite a significant OSB price correction in the quarter and ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges, LP delivered its second best quarter ever. Siding sales grew at 19%, LP South America and EWP set all-time quarterly records, and the OSB business continued to generate impressive cash flows. Entekra, our California-based off-site advanced framing system business was gross profit positive in the quarter and continues to gain customer acceptance and operational momentum. 
Demand for LP's products remain robust, and our capacity expansion projects at Houlton and Peace Valley are on schedule. We also strengthened our strategic relationships with key customers, including being named Partner of the Year in our category by -- The Home Depot. 
As you will see on Slide 5 of the presentation, sales for Siding Solutions increased by 19%. Another record quarter made possible by strong demand and exceptional performance by the Siding operations team. Siding efficiently produced and shipped over 430 million square feet and more importantly, they did so safely without a single recordable injury in the quarter. The fastest-growing components of the Siding portfolio are innovative products like ExpertFinish Prefinished siding, smooth siding and shapes. 
We shipped more than 4x the volume of those products compared to Q3 of last year. These newer products contributed significantly to the segment's price growth in the quarter. OSB sales were up over $230 million from last year, but down sequentially as OSB prices corrected early in the quarter. Since reaching the recent low in August, random lengths OSB prices have steadily increased, supported by consistently strong demand. The Engineered Wood Products segment had another record quarter with twice their sales revenue and more than 4x EBITDA for the same quarter last year.
South America also had a very strong quarter with more stable OSB prices than seen in North America. Compared to Q3 of last year, sales in South America increased to almost 70% and EBITDA more than tripled. As we have seen recently, LP South America is capable of significant cash flow generation, and we are reinvesting that cash in South America to grow capacity and improve OEE in order to stay ahead of steadily growing demand. 
The Siding conversion project at Houlton remains on schedule, with production expected to begin in the first quarter of next year. The mill has discontinued production of Laminated Strand Lumber and OSB production will cease this week to begin the last phases of the conversion process. 
Inflationary pressures have impacted the Houlton project somewhat, particularly the price of steel, but the long-term nature of material and labor contracts for the project have blended these inflationary pressures somewhat. I want to thank the team there for keeping the conversion process safe and on schedule. The Peace Valley restart has also gone exceptionally well.
I'm grateful to the local mill leadership as well as the OSB operations and support functions for a safe and efficient restart. The mill is ahead of its planned ramp-up curve and produced just over 100 million square feet in Q3.
With [ housing starts ] consensus, higher now than when we announced the restart, there's no question that the market needs the mills output. Peace Valley will also contribute to our Structural Solutions strategy as a significant producer of TechShield radiant barrier that we work to transform our portfolio away from commodity OSB to hire more constructural solutions.
The resulting financial performance for Q3 is summarized on Page 6 of the presentation. LPs businesses generated a combined $1.2 billion in sales, $522 million in EBITDA and $3.87 in earnings per share. We returned over $400 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, all of it from free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.18 per share dividend. And as Alan will detail authorized a further $500 million for share repurchases.
Supply chain interruptions and inflationary pressures are presenting headwinds. While we have benefited from higher OSB prices, some of those gains are now being offset by higher prices and tight availability for resins and freight where we have seen meaningful price increases. We are working to minimize these impacts by partnering with our suppliers, balancing costs and risks with agile inventory management and seeking alternative sources of supply where possible.
I am proud of and confident in our strategic sourcing and operations teams as they navigate these challenges. I want to talk about how we are responding to these inflationary pressures. When faced with raw material scarcity, we have consistently allocated limited resources to the most strategic applications. Because our OSB business has maintained the flexibility to use various resin types, we've been able to ship MDI resins to siding in order to maintain production, product quality and growth. 
For freight, flatbed trucks are in tight supply, we have the ability to convert shipments from truck to rail, and we have our own small trucking fleet, both of which contributed to record siding shipments in the quarter. We can't predict the duration of the supply chain challenges, but our teams will continue to work diligently to minimize their impact.
Before I turn the call over to Alan to review our financial performance in more detail, I want to announce 2 changes to LP's executive leadership team. First, Neil Sherman, who joined LP in 1994 and has served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP Siding business since January of 2017, will transition to lead Entekra as its President. Neil has done a tremendous job of growing LP Siding business, and he is exactly the kind of leader in Entekra needs to reach its potential as an innovative and disruptive building technology.
Second, Jason Ringblom, who joined LP in 2004 and has served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP's OSB and EWP businesses since January 2017 will succeed Neil as EVP and General Manager of the signing business. Jason has been instrumental in transforming LP's OSB business, increasing its operational agility and efficiency while shifting the focus from commodity products to value-added structural solutions. Jason is rejoining the Siding business, where he previously held a leadership position with our sales team. So he's very familiar with the SmartSide customer values and value proposition. Neil and Jason's leadership of Siding and OSB has been critically important to LP's ongoing strategic transformation.
I am extremely grateful for their contributions, and I am confident they will continue to deliver outstanding results in their new roles. Both of them have built world-class teams that lead and execute their business strategies. And I know neither team will skip a beat during this transition. Both Jason and Neil will remain in their current roles for a brief transition period until we appoint a new EVP and General Manager for OSB and EWP, a process that we hope to complete soon.
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for the third quarter as well as an update on our capital allocation strategy and our outlook for Q4 and the full year."

Before I dive into the financial results for the quarter, I'd like to add my personal thanks and congratulations to both Neil and Jason. LP's results for the past several quarters, even years are due in no small part to their leadership, and I'm confident they'll be equally impactful in their new roles.  
As Brad said, the third quarter of 2021 was LP's second best quarter ever. Page 7 of today's presentation summarizes these results compared to the third quarter of last year. Revenue increased by 53% from almost $800 million last year to $1.2 billion this year. Just over half of this increase, $225 million was the result of higher OSB prices. Siding added $49 million to which EWP, South America and Entekra collectively added a further $148 million in revenue. EBITDA increased by 90% year-over-year from $273 million to $522 million. OSB prices and Siding growth added $225 million and $31 million, respectively. South America and EWP added a further $60 million.  
However, inflation in wages, raw materials and freight costs increased by $58 million compared to last year's deflationary environment and costs for the Houlton conversion and the Peace Valley restart totaled $10 million in the quarter.  
The waterfall on Slide 8 adds year-over-year revenue and EBITDA detail for the Siding segment. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 19%, with both volume and price increasing by 9% year-over-year. The Siding team shipped 432 million square feet of SmartSide in the third quarter made possible by a remarkably efficient production and shipping in response to unrelenting demand. And quite frankly, shipments of 432 million square feet in the quarter is more than we thought possible prior to the additional capacity of Houlton coming online next year.
On the cost side, we have accelerated our investments in selling and marketing after sharply curtailing them last year during COVID. We intend to continue investing at this rate in the fourth quarter and beyond to drive demand creation particularly for ExpertFinish and anticipation of the [ Home startup ]. OEE improved to 89% for a net transformation impact of $33 million in EBITDA. Inflation of raw materials, mostly resin and paper, added $18 million of costs and freight costs increased by $10 million.
After running our mills at near maximum capacity for more than a year, we completed some necessary sustaining maintenance projects at a total cost of $7 million in the quarter. One such project that began at quarter end and is now almost complete, is a press rebuild at our siding mill in Swan Valley, Manitoba, the impact of which will mostly be felt in the fourth quarter. We also incurred $3 million of conversion costs at Houlton. The resulting EBITDA of $73 million is therefore down $3 million from 2020, bringing the quarterly EBITDA margin to 23% or 27% on a year-to-date basis.
The chart on Slide 9 show that revenue for Siding solutions continues to grow faster than single-family housing starts on a trailing 12-month basis, with Siding revenue growing by 33%, while starts increased by 23%. The pie charts show continued growth in innovative Siding products like ExpertFinish, smooth siding, shakes and corners. For the third quarter, these new higher value-added products made up 10% of Siding volume, 15% of Siding revenue and contributed 3 points of the 9% price increases for the segment.
Slide 10 shows the quarter in more detail for our OSB business. OSB prices fell steeply in the first weeks of the third quarter before stabilizing in August and are down sequentially from record highs. However, compared to last year, higher prices added $225 million of revenue and EBITDA. On our last quarterly call, we guided to OSB revenue being about 10% below the second quarter or around $700 million, provided that OSB prices remained steady at the levels published the previous Friday by Random Lengths. As we now know, of course, prices continue to fall from that point before rebounding. By quarter end, the actual average weekly Random Lengths price for [ 7 16 ] sheeting was approximately $100 lower than it would have been as prices remained flat after our last call. And at roughly 1 billion square feet of quarterly capacity, the $100 price difference would imply a revenue difference of about $100 million, yielding an adjusted estimate of about $600 million in revenue, which it turns out is precisely the result in third quarter revenue. 
Price again swamps other factors in the OSB waterfall, but I will address the other components briefly. Volume was up in the quarter due to production at Peace Valley offsetting the onetime costs associated with its restart. OEE in the quarter was down compared to the prior year, partly due to resin substitutions and partly due to maintenance and production issues, resulting in a $4 million hit to EBITDA. The same inflationary pressures we discussed for Siding also impacted OSB with resin and freight inflation costing $15 million and $11 million in the quarter, respectively.
I wouldn't normally point this out, but the freight Variance is abnormally large this quarter, so I should note that whereas Siding is typically sold at delivered prices, freight costs in OSB are generally passed through. Therefore, the OSB freight cost increase in the quarter is offset within the price component with no net EBITDA impact. So OSB ended the quarter with $600 million in revenue, $381 million in EBITDA and another remarkable quarter of cash generation.
And while not shown in waterfall charts, EWP and LP South America had remarkable quarters as well, with strong demand and pricing more than offsetting increases in raw material costs, which brings me to a summary of cash flows in the quarter and a capital allocation update. Operating cash flow was a little over $500 million in the third quarter. After $68 million in capital spending, we returned $416 million to shareholders, comprising $399 million in share repurchases and $17 million in dividends, and we ended the quarter with cash balances essentially unchanged.
LP repurchased 6.8 million shares during the third quarter, ending the quarter with 90.2 million shares outstanding. As of yesterday, we have spent a further $156 million since quarter end to repurchase 2.5 million more shares. This brings the remaining balance of our $1 billion authorization to $157 million. And our current number of shares outstanding as of right now to slightly under $88 million.
Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share and authorized a further $500 million for ongoing share repurchases, bringing our total repurchase authorization as of today to a little over $650 million.
Slide 11 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter. We are lowering our full year CapEx guidance slightly to account for longer lead times and contractor availability issues. While Houlton remains on schedule, the completion of some of the smaller projects may unfortunately be pushed into early 2022. Raw materials and logistics, particularly flatbed freight, continue to exhibit tight supply and elevated prices. While we are currently able to procure all the resin and other raw materials that we need, inflationary pressures may dampen margins somewhat in the near term for all segments.
With respect to Siding. On the last call, we guided to revenue growth of 10% for the second half of the year and a full year EBITDA margin of about 25%. Despite the business growing in the third quarter twice the rate necessary to hit that guidance, I'm reiterating both aspects of that guidance today. And here's why: While the price growth experienced in the third quarter is certainly sustainable, similar volume growth in the fourth quarter is unlikely simply because the much-needed maintenance projects, especially the press rebuild at Swan Valley have temporarily lowered production. 
The EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter would probably have been similar to that of the third quarter, with price increases once again offsetting raw material inflation, if not for 2 factors. The first is the lower production capacity. The lost volume has a high variable margin of around 50%. And the second is the cost of other investments we're making for future growth, increased selling and marketing, the Houlton conversion, the Swan press rebuild and other critical maintenance and growth projects designed to derisk and debottleneck operations will add roughly $25 million of discretionary costs in the fourth quarter. 
Although these actions will result in an EBITDA lower than both the third quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, the resulting full year EBITDA margin still meets our long-term target of 25%, which was set at that level precisely because of the need to make periodic investments such as these. Now we're confident that these actions position the business very well for additional growth in 2022, particularly when Houlton comes online.
OSB is somewhat simpler with volume increases from Peace Valley, partially offsetting sequentially lower OSB prices. Provided the quarter-to-date average OSB price hold throughout the fourth quarter, the resulting OSB revenue will be down about 30% sequentially from the third quarter. 
So in conclusion, given the usual caveats about sudden changes in demand, unexpected changes in raw material price or availability or other unforeseeable factors, the resulting EBITDA for the fourth quarter should be somewhat above $200 million. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Also in South America, I'm trying to get a sense as to how much of that you think is step change and reflective of the growth and changes in that business versus cyclical? And then somewhat relatedly, because this is sort of not the siding and not the OSB. So Neil is taking over Entekra, which is interesting, obviously, around the Siding business. And what does that potentially say, if anything, about what you think Entekra potentially can become in time? And maybe if you can give us some help on that."
286119,1684947439,2421598,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Sure. let me start with South America. Really proud of the business improvement, really over the last 3 years, but particularly this year. Mark, there's no question, some of that margin is aided by the pricing, the world wide price always be the price, lo",688,"Sure. let me start with South America. Really proud of the business improvement, really over the last 3 years, but particularly this year. Mark, there's no question, some of that margin is aided by the pricing, the world wide price always be the price, lowest being North America. You can imagine that imports to South America diminish from North America when we had the kind of pricing environment we had up here this year, which allows us to push price down there. I do think there is a ratchet up in performance in South America, but they will -- I do believe there will be some pricing moderation as we see the decline in pricing or experienced the decline in pricing in North America, but the magnitude of price increase and the magnitude of price decrease in South America historically has been a lot less volatile than what we've seen in North America.
But I do think we should expect some moderation of margin down there. Now there is a component of that margin improvement, though, that is sustainable and that's operational OEE aspect of the business. That -- historically, that has been our poorest OEE division if you type crude siding in North American OSB's divisions or segments. They've made really good movement over the past year, and there's a lot of room for future improvement. And then we also have a pretty aggressive for the scale of that business, capital reinvestment strategy down there. We're primarily focused on improved machine reliability. 
And so there's room for us to continue to improve South America from a cost standpoint. And then I guess there's a little bit of latency on how pricing kind of gets into equilibrium. And I don't think we'll know that for a quarter or 2 in South America, but we'll obviously continue to report out on that. 
On Entekra. Entekra is very strategic to us. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made in that business over this past year, but I think that they're speaking of step change, Mark, there's a step change needed. I believe we have validated market acceptance. I've said that on this call before, but we really have to bring a level of confidence in to just the overall operations of that business and the delivery of the value proposition. 
So we made a couple of moves in the quarter. We -- one that we mentioned on the call, we did that one of our very experienced plant managers into the Badesto facility is now the plant manager. And then as we talked about, we're moving Neil over there to be President. So we see this as a very significant strategic opportunity for us. We think the timing is right to really put some concentrated resources on it. Obviously, Neil has a great track record over his tenure in Siding of growing that business and building a really strong team that was capable of doing that. And we want to kind of lift and place him over in Entekra to see the same kind of rapid business improvement. 
And then we're very blessed to have a strong bench. Jason spent portions of his career associated with, particularly, with the sales side of our Siding business. So I feel really good about Jason's ability to continue the good performance in Siding as well. So -- but it does -- I guess the nature of your question, what does this say about Entekra. It says that we see it as a huge opportunity, and we're really getting serious about getting a manufacturing competency so that we can continue to grow that business. 
We'll probably -- we'll have revenue in the business of around $100 million this year of Entekra. We're close to breakeven EBITDA, particularly in the second half of the year. So I mean, $100 million from $0, 18 months ago, does show that the revenue generation capacity of this business. And -- so we're excited about turning that into a growth engine that is creating value. And that's Neil's job is to get that done as quickly as possible."

There's 2 components to the growth in sales and marketing expense in siding and one of them is that we cut it pretty severely Q2 of last year. So some of that is just a recovery back to somewhat of a normal run rate that we had been on. we, obviously, cut at Q2 of last year thinking that would not be experiencing the reality of what the COVID impact on housing, but also just to calibrate us all, the Prefinished strategy, the ExpertFinish strategy is one -- is very different from selling into new home construction. 
Ultimately, the decision is made on siding choice in the home with a home homeowner deeply involved in that. So it's a bit more of a consumer sale. And so our marketing expense is primarily focused about building brand identity around Prefinished -- our ExpertFinish brand, supporting, repair and remodel, contractor base around making that sale and just getting that exposure and placement that we need to be a national presence as far as Prefinish Siding. 
So it is at a step historically with what we've done from a marketing percentage or marketing dollar standpoint, but very consistent with what is required in order to have an effective prepare and remodel present in siding. 
Now what part of your question was -- well, I think the nature of that question, John, was that we're oversold now, so is now the time to be spending it, we think so. It does take a little while to build the kind of brand credibility and with the investments we're making around capacity expansion, we do want to be ahead of that a little bit on the marketing side so that when Houlton comes up, particularly on the East Coast, a big repair and remodel market. And then Sagola, following that, we've got some momentum on the sales and marketing side, the marketing side, in particular, to support that extra capacity. 
It's a judgment game, honestly, around how and when the magnitude of that marketing spend. But I feel like we do have a credible -- a very credible team that knows how to spend those dollars wisely. So I'm confident of that, that any mistake would be maybe we get ahead of it a little bit. But I do feel like it's a minimal investment compared to the size of the capacity expansion capital and makes a lot of sense, given our recent history of sales growth and our ability to support that kind of level of spend in support of the brand."

I would say, obviously, given the pricing moderation, the last 3 months or so, there's been some -- some return to quasi-normal inventory levels. I would still characterize them as lean, if you look historically, but certainly not as lean as it was 6 months ago. And so as we go into the winter, there's typically or historically a low between Thanksgiving and say, January -- the new year around building -- if building remain -- if new construction, multifamily construction stays strong, I could see the supply chain remaining on the lean side of normal. If we get a slowdown in construction over that period of time, which would typically be weather-related, if it happens, we could see more of a return to a normal inventory situation by the time we get to the new year. 
I don't see any scenario where the channel gets heavy with inventory, though. I think -- I just think there's too much catch-up to do given how we started this year for that to happen. And I think housing demand is too strong as well. But certainly, more -- there's more inventory available in the channel than there was 6 months ago, but I would just still call it on the lean side."

Before I turn the call over to Brad and Alan, I'm happy to announce that we published an environmental product declaration for SmartSide last week. We have known for years that SmartSide performs very well and looks great. As the EPD demonstrates, it is also classified as carbon negative, making it exceptionally sustainable, especially when compared to alternative siding substrates. LP is also expected to publish its first ESG report later in November, including SASB disclosures. Sustainability is a core value at LP, and we're excited to share our story. The SmartSide EPD is available on LP's website, and our ESG report will be published soon.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the third quarter of 2021. Despite a significant OSB price correction in the quarter and ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges, LP delivered its second best quarter ever. Siding sales grew at 19%, LP South America and EWP set all-time quarterly records, and the OSB business continued to generate impressive cash flows. Entekra, our California-based off-site advanced framing system business was gross profit positive in the quarter and continues to gain customer acceptance and operational momentum. 
Demand for LP's products remain robust, and our capacity expansion projects at Houlton and Peace Valley are on schedule. We also strengthened our strategic relationships with key customers, including being named Partner of the Year in our category by The Home Depot. 
As you will see on Slide 5 of the presentation, sales for Siding Solutions increased by 19%. Another record quarter made possible by strong demand and exceptional performance by the Siding operations team. Siding efficiently produced and shipped over 430 million square feet and more importantly, they did so safely without a single recordable injury in the quarter. The fastest-growing components of the Siding portfolio are innovative products like ExpertFinish prefinished siding, smooth siding and shakes. 
We shipped more than 4x the volume of those products compared to Q3 of last year. These newer products contributed significantly to the segment's price growth in the quarter. OSB sales were up over $230 million from last year, but down sequentially as OSB prices corrected early in the quarter. Since reaching the recent low in August, random lengths OSB prices have steadily increased, supported by consistently strong demand. The Engineered Wood Products segment had another record quarter with twice their sales revenue and more than 4x the EBITDA of the same quarter last year.
South America also had a very strong quarter with more stable OSB prices than seen in North America. Compared to Q3 of last year, sales in South America increased almost 70% and EBITDA more than tripled. As we have seen recently, LP South America is capable of significant cash flow generation, and we are reinvesting that cash in South America to grow capacity and improve OEE in order to stay ahead of steadily growing demand. 
The Siding conversion project at Houlton remains on schedule, with production expected to begin in the first quarter of next year. The mill has discontinued production of Laminated Strand Lumber and OSB production will cease this week to begin the last phases of the conversion process. 
Inflationary pressures have impacted the Houlton project somewhat, particularly the price of steel, but the long-term nature of material and labor contracts for the project have blended these inflationary pressures somewhat. I want to thank the team there for keeping the conversion process safe and on schedule. The Peace Valley restart has also gone exceptionally well.
I'm grateful to the local mill leadership as well as the OSB operations and support functions for a safe and efficient restart. The mill is ahead of its planned ramp-up curve and produced just over 100 million square feet in Q3.
With [ housing starts ] consensus, higher now than when we announced the restart, there's no question that the market needs the mills output. Peace Valley will also contribute to our Structural Solutions strategy as a significant producer of TechShield radiant barrier as we work to transform our portfolio away from commodity OSB to hire more constructural solutions.
The resulting financial performance for Q3 is summarized on Page 6 of the presentation. LPs businesses generated a combined $1.2 billion in sales, $522 million in EBITDA and $3.87 in earnings per share. We returned over $400 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, all of it from free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.18 per share dividend. And as Alan will detail authorized a further $500 million for share repurchases.
Supply chain interruptions and inflationary pressures are presenting headwinds. While we have benefited from higher OSB prices, some of those gains are now being offset by higher prices and tight availability for resins and freight where we have seen meaningful price increases. We are working to minimize these impacts by partnering with our suppliers, balancing costs and risks with agile inventory management and seeking alternate sources of supply where possible.
I am proud of and confident in our strategic sourcing and operations teams as they navigate these challenges. I want to talk about how we are responding to these inflationary pressures. When faced with raw material scarcity, we have consistently allocated limited resources to the most strategic applications. Because our OSB business has maintained the flexibility to use various resin types, we've been able to ship MDI resins to siding in order to maintain production, product quality and growth. 
For freight, flatbed trucks are in tight supply. We have the ability to convert shipments from truck to rail, and we have our own small trucking fleet, both of which contributed to record siding shipments in the quarter. We can't predict the duration of the supply chain challenges, but our teams will continue to work diligently to minimize their impact.
Before I turn the call over to Alan to review our financial performance in more detail, I want to announce 2 changes to LP's executive leadership team. First, Neil Sherman, who joined LP in 1994 and has served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP Siding business since January of 2017, will transition to lead Entekra as its President. Neil has done a tremendous job of growing LP Siding business, and he is exactly the kind of leader Entekra needs to reach its potential as an innovative and disruptive building technology.
Second, Jason Ringblom, who joined LP in 2004 and has served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP's OSB and EWP businesses since January 2017 will succeed Neil as EVP and General Manager of the Siding business. Jason has been instrumental in transforming LP's OSB business, increasing its operational agility and efficiency while shifting the focus from commodity products to value-added Structural Solutions. Jason is rejoining the Siding business, where he previously held a leadership position with our sales team. So he's very familiar with the SmartSide customer values and value proposition. Neil and Jason's leadership of Siding and OSB has been critically important to LP's ongoing strategic transformation.
I am extremely grateful for their contributions, and I am confident they will continue to deliver outstanding results in their new roles. Both of them have built world-class teams that lead and execute their business strategies. And I know neither team will skip a beat during this transition. Both Jason and Neil will remain in their current roles for a brief transition period until we appoint a new EVP and General Manager for OSB and EWP, a process that we hope to complete soon.
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for the third quarter as well as an update on our capital allocation strategy and our outlook for Q4 and the full year."

Before I dive into the financial results for the quarter, I'd like to add my personal thanks and congratulations to both Neil and Jason. LP's results for the past several quarters, even years are due in no small part to their leadership, and I'm confident they'll be equally impactful in their new roles.  
As Brad said, the third quarter of 2021 was LP's second best quarter ever. Page 7 of today's presentation summarizes these results compared to the third quarter of last year. Revenue increased by 53% from almost $800 million last year to $1.2 billion this year. Just over half of this increase, $225 million was the result of higher OSB prices. Siding added $49 million to which EWP, South America and Entekra collectively added a further $148 million in revenue. EBITDA increased by 90% year-over-year from $273 million to $522 million. OSB prices and Siding growth added $225 million and $31 million, respectively. South America and EWP added a further $60 million.  
However, inflation in wages, raw materials and freight costs increased by $58 million compared to last year's deflationary environment and costs for the Houlton conversion and the Peace Valley restart totaled $10 million in the quarter.  
The waterfall on Slide 8 adds year-over-year revenue and EBITDA detail for the Siding segment. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 19%, with both volume and price increasing by 9% year-over-year. The Siding team shipped 432 million square feet of SmartSide in the third quarter made possible by a remarkably efficient production and shipping in response to unrelenting demand. And quite frankly, shipments of 432 million square feet in a quarter is more than we thought possible prior to the additional capacity of Houlton coming online next year.
On the cost side, we have accelerated our investments in selling and marketing after sharply curtailing them last year during COVID. We intend to continue investing at this rate in the fourth quarter and beyond to drive demand creation, particularly for ExpertFinish, in anticipation of the Houlton startup. OEE improved to 89% for a net transformation impact of $33 million in EBITDA. Inflation of raw materials, mostly resin and paper, added $18 million of costs and freight costs increased by $10 million.
After running our mills at near maximum capacity for more than a year, we completed some necessary sustaining maintenance projects at a total cost of $7 million in the quarter. One such project that began at quarter end and is now almost complete, is a press rebuild at our siding mill in Swan Valley, Manitoba, the impact of which will mostly be felt in the fourth quarter. We also incurred $3 million of conversion costs at Houlton. The resulting EBITDA of $73 million is therefore down $3 million from 2020, bringing the quarterly EBITDA margin to 23% or 27% on a year-to-date basis.
The chart on Slide 9 show that revenue for Siding Solutions continues to grow faster than single-family housing starts on a trailing 12-month basis, with Siding revenue growing by 33%, while starts increased by 23%. The pie charts show continued growth in innovative Siding products like ExpertFinish, smooth siding, shakes and corners. For the third quarter, these new higher value-added products made up 10% of Siding volume, 15% of Siding revenue and contributed 3 points of the 9% price increases for the segment.
Slide 10 shows the quarter in more detail for our OSB business. OSB prices fell steeply in the first weeks of the third quarter before stabilizing in August and are down sequentially from record highs. However, compared to last year, higher prices added $225 million of revenue and EBITDA. On our last quarterly call, we guided to OSB revenue being about 10% below the second quarter or around $700 million, provided that OSB prices remained steady at the levels published the previous Friday by Random Lengths. As we now know, of course, prices continue to fall from that point before rebounding. By quarter end, the actual average weekly Random Lengths price for 7/16 sheathing was approximately $100 lower than it would have been had prices remained flat after our last call. And at roughly 1 billion square feet of quarterly capacity, the $100 price difference would imply a revenue difference of about $100 million, yielding an adjusted estimate of about $600 million in revenue, which it turns out is precisely the result in third quarter revenue. 
Price again swamps other factors in the OSB waterfall, but I will address the other components briefly. Volume was up in the quarter due to production at Peace Valley offsetting the onetime costs associated with its restart. OEE in the quarter was down compared to the prior year, partly due to resin substitutions and partly due to maintenance and production issues, resulting in a $4 million hit to EBITDA. The same inflationary pressures we discussed for Siding also impacted OSB with resin and freight inflation costing $15 million and $11 million in the quarter, respectively.
I wouldn't normally point this out, but the freight Variance is abnormally large this quarter, so I should note that whereas Siding is typically sold at delivered prices, freight costs in OSB are generally passed through. Therefore, the OSB freight cost increase in the quarter is offset within the price component with no net EBITDA impact. So OSB ended the quarter with $600 million in revenue, $381 million in EBITDA and another remarkable quarter of cash generation.
And while not shown in waterfall charts, EWP and LP South America had remarkable quarters as well, with strong demand and pricing more than offsetting increases in raw material costs, which brings me to a summary of cash flows in the quarter and a capital allocation update. Operating cash flow was a little over $500 million in the third quarter. After $68 million in capital spending, we returned $416 million to shareholders, comprising $399 million in share repurchases and $17 million in dividends, and we ended the quarter with cash balances essentially unchanged.
LP repurchased 6.8 million shares during the third quarter, ending the quarter with 90.2 million shares outstanding. As of yesterday, we have spent a further $156 million since quarter end to repurchase 2.5 million more shares. This brings the remaining balance of our $1 billion authorization to $157 million. And our current number of shares outstanding as of right now to slightly under $88 million.
Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share and authorized a further $500 million for ongoing share repurchases, bringing our total repurchase authorization as of today to a little over $650 million.
Slide 11 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter. We are lowering our full year CapEx guidance slightly to account for longer lead times and contractor availability issues. While Houlton remains on schedule, the completion of some of the smaller projects may unfortunately be pushed into early 2022. Raw materials and logistics, particularly flatbed freight, continue to exhibit tight supply and elevated prices. While we are currently able to procure all the resin and other raw materials that we need, inflationary pressures may dampen margins somewhat in the near term for all segments.
With respect to Siding, on the last call, we guided to revenue growth of 10% for the second half of the year and a full year EBITDA margin of about 25%. Despite the business growing in the third quarter at twice the rate necessary to hit that guidance, I'm reiterating both aspects of that guidance today. And here's why: while the price growth experienced in the third quarter is certainly sustainable, similar volume growth in the fourth quarter is unlikely simply because the much-needed maintenance projects, especially the press rebuild at Swan Valley, have temporarily lowered production. 
The EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter would probably have been similar to that of the third quarter, with price increases once again offsetting raw material inflation, if not for 2 factors. The first is the lower production capacity. The lost volume has a high variable margin of around 50%. And the second is the cost of other investments we're making for future growth, increased selling and marketing, the Houlton conversion, the Swan press rebuild and other critical maintenance and growth projects designed to derisk and debottleneck operations will add roughly $25 million of discretionary costs in the fourth quarter. 
Although these actions will result in an EBITDA lower than both the third quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, the resulting full year EBITDA margin still meets our long-term target of 25%, which was set at that level precisely because of the need to make periodic investments such as these. Now we're confident that these actions position the business very well for additional growth in 2022, particularly when Houlton comes online.
OSB is somewhat simpler with volume increases from Peace Valley, partially offsetting sequentially lower OSB prices. Provided the quarter-to-date average OSB price holds throughout the fourth quarter, the resulting OSB revenue will be down about 30% sequentially from the third quarter. 
So in conclusion, given the usual caveats about sudden changes in demand, unexpected changes in raw material price or availability or other unforeseeable factors, the resulting EBITDA for the fourth quarter should be somewhat above $200 million. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Mark, there's no question, some of that margin is aided by the pricing, the world wide price of OSB -- the price of OSB in North America. You can imagine that imports to South America diminished from North America when we had the kind of pricing environment we had up here this year, which allows us to push price down there. I do think there is a ratchet up in performance in South America, but there will -- I do believe there will be some pricing moderation as we see the decline in pricing or experienced the decline in pricing in North America. But the magnitude of price increase and the magnitude of price decrease in South America historically has been a lot less volatile than what we've seen in North America.
But I do think we should expect some moderation of margin down there. Now there is a component of that margin improvement, though, that is sustainable and that's operational OEE aspect of the business. That -- historically, that has been our poorest OEE division if you type -- include Siding in North American OSB as divisions or segments. They've made really good movement over the past year, and there's a lot of room for future improvement. And then we also have a pretty aggressive for the scale of that business, capital reinvestment strategy down there. We're primarily focused on improved machine reliability. 
And so there's room for us to continue to improve South America from a cost standpoint. And then I guess there's a little bit of latency on how pricing kind of gets into equilibrium. And I don't think we'll know that for a quarter or 2 in South America, but we'll obviously continue to report out on that. 
On Entekra -- Entekra is very strategic to us. I really am pleased with the progress we've made in that business over this past year, but I think that they're speaking of step change, Mark, there's a step change needed. I believe we have validated market acceptance. I've said that on this call before, but we really have to bring a level of confidence in to just the overall operations of that business and the delivery of the value proposition. 
So we made a couple moves in the quarter. We -- one that we mentioned on the call, we did put one of our very experienced plant managers into the Modesto facility and is now the plant manager. And then as we talked about, we're moving Neil over there to be President. So we see this as a very significant strategic opportunity for us. We think the timing is right to really put some concentrated resources on it. Obviously, Neil has a great track record over his tenure in Siding of growing that business, of building a really strong team that was capable of doing that. And we want to kind of lift and place him over in Entekra to see the same kind of rapid business improvement. 
And then we're very blessed to have a strong bench. Jason has spent portions of his career associated with, particularly, with the sales side of our Siding business. So I feel really good about Jason's ability to continue the good performance in Siding as well. So -- but it does -- I guess the nature of your question is what does this say about Entekra. It says that we see it as a huge opportunity, and we're really getting serious about getting a manufacturing competency so that we can continue to grow that business. 
We'll probably -- we'll have revenue in the business of around $100 million this year of Entekra. We're close to breakeven EBITDA, particularly in the second half of the year. So I mean, $100 million from $0, 18 months ago, does show that the revenue generation capacity of this business. And -- so we're excited about turning that into a growth engine that is creating value. And that's Neil's job is to get that done as quickly as possible."

There's 2 components to the growth in sales and marketing expense in Siding and one of them is that we cut it pretty severely Q2 of last year. So some of that is just a recovery back to somewhat of a normal run rate that we had been on. We, obviously, cut it Q2 of last year thinking that would not be experiencing the reality of what the COVID impact on housing, but also just to calibrate us all, the prefinished strategy, the ExpertFinish strategy is one -- is very different from selling into new home construction. 
Ultimately, the decision is made on siding choice in the home with the home homeowner deeply involved in that. So it's a bit more of a consumer sale. And so our marketing expense is primarily focused about building brand identity around prefinished -- our ExpertFinish brand, supporting, repair and remodel, contractor base around making that sale and just getting that exposure and placement that we need to be a national presence as far as prefinish siding. 
So it is out of step historically with what we've done from a marketing percentage or marketing dollar standpoint, but very consistent with what is required in order to have an effective repair and remodel present in siding. 
Now part of your question was, well if you're -- I think the nature of that question, John, was if -- you're oversold now, so is now the time to be spending it? We think so. It does take a little while to build the kind of brand credibility. And with the investments we're making around capacity expansion, we do want to be ahead of that a little bit on the marketing side so that when Houlton comes up, particularly on the East Coast, a big repair and remodel market. And then Sagola following that, we've got some momentum on the sales and marketing side -- the marketing side, in particular, to support that extra capacity. 
It's a judgment game, honestly, around how and when the magnitude of that marketing spend. But I feel like we do have a credible -- a very credible team that knows how to spend those dollars wisely. So I'm confident of that, that any mistake would be maybe we'd get ahead of it a little bit. But I do feel like it's a minimal investment compared to the size of the capacity expansion capital and makes a lot of sense, given our recent history of sales growth and our ability to support that kind of level of spend in support of the brand."

The appendix of the presentation also contains some necessary reconciliations that are further supplemented by this morning's 8-K filing. Rather than reading these statements, I incorporate them herein by reference.
Before I turn the call over to Brad and Alan, I'm happy to announce that we published an environmental product declaration for SmartSide last week. We have known for years that SmartSide performs very well and looks great. As the EPD demonstrates, it is also classified as carbon negative, making it exceptionally sustainable, especially when compared to alternative siding substrates. LP is also expected to publish its first ESG report later in November, including SASB disclosures. Sustainability is a core value at LP, and we're excited to share our story. The SmartSide EPD is available on LP's website, and our ESG report will be published soon.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss LP's results for the third quarter of 2021. Despite a significant OSB price correction in the quarter and ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges, LP delivered its second best quarter ever. Siding sales grew at 19%, LP South America and EWP set all-time quarterly records, and the OSB business continued to generate impressive cash flows. Entekra, our California-based off-site advanced framing system business was gross profit positive in the quarter and continues to gain customer acceptance and operational momentum. 
Demand for LP's products remain robust, and our capacity expansion projects at Houlton and Peace Valley are on schedule. We also strengthened our strategic relationships with key customers, including being named Partner of the Year in our category by The Home Depot. 
As you will see on Slide 5 of the presentation, sales for Siding Solutions increased by 19%. Another record quarter made possible by strong demand and exceptional performance by the Siding operations team. Siding efficiently produced and shipped over 430 million square feet and more importantly, they did so safely without a single recordable injury in the quarter. The fastest-growing components of the Siding portfolio are innovative products like ExpertFinish prefinished siding, smooth siding and shakes. 
We shipped more than 4x the volume of those products compared to Q3 of last year. These newer products contributed significantly to the segment's price growth in the quarter. OSB sales were up over $230 million from last year, but down sequentially as OSB prices corrected early in the quarter. Since reaching the recent low in August, random lengths OSB prices have steadily increased, supported by consistently strong demand. The Engineered Wood Products segment had another record quarter with twice their sales revenue and more than 4x the EBITDA of the same quarter last year.
South America also had a very strong quarter with more stable OSB prices than seen in North America. Compared to Q3 of last year, sales in South America increased almost 70% and EBITDA more than tripled. As we have seen recently, LP South America is capable of significant cash flow generation, and we are reinvesting that cash in South America to grow capacity and improve OEE in order to stay ahead of steadily growing demand. 
The Siding conversion project at Houlton remains on schedule, with production expected to begin in the first quarter of next year. The mill has discontinued production of Laminated Strand Lumber and OSB production will cease this week to begin the last phases of the conversion process. 
Inflationary pressures have impacted the Houlton project somewhat, particularly the price of steel, but the long-term nature of material and labor contracts for the project have blended these inflationary pressures somewhat. I want to thank the team there for keeping the conversion process safe and on schedule. The Peace Valley restart has also gone exceptionally well.
I'm grateful to the local mill leadership as well as the OSB operations and support functions for a safe and efficient restart. The mill is ahead of its planned ramp-up curve and produced just over 100 million square feet in Q3.
With [ housing starts ] consensus, higher now than when we announced the restart, there's no question that the market needs the mills output. Peace Valley will also contribute to our Structural Solutions strategy as a significant producer of TechShield radiant barrier as we work to transform our portfolio away from commodity OSB to hire more constructural solutions.
The resulting financial performance for Q3 is summarized on Page 6 of the presentation. LPs businesses generated a combined $1.2 billion in sales, $522 million in EBITDA and $3.87 in earnings per share. We returned over $400 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, all of it from free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.18 per share dividend. And as Alan will detail authorized a further $500 million for share repurchases.
Supply chain interruptions and inflationary pressures are presenting headwinds. While we have benefited from higher OSB prices, some of those gains are now being offset by higher prices and tight availability for resins and freight where we have seen meaningful price increases. We are working to minimize these impacts by partnering with our suppliers, balancing costs and risks with agile inventory management and seeking alternate sources of supply where possible.
I am proud of and confident in our strategic sourcing and operations teams as they navigate these challenges. I want to talk about how we are responding to these inflationary pressures. When faced with raw material scarcity, we have consistently allocated limited resources to the most strategic applications. Because our OSB business has maintained the flexibility to use various resin types, we've been able to ship MDI resins to siding in order to maintain production, product quality and growth. 
For freight, flatbed trucks are in tight supply. We have the ability to convert shipments from truck to rail, and we have our own small trucking fleet, both of which contributed to record siding shipments in the quarter. We can't predict the duration of these supply chain challenges, but our teams will continue to work diligently to minimize their impact.
Before I turn the call over to Alan to review our financial performance in more detail, I want to announce 2 changes to LP's executive leadership team. First, Neil Sherman, who joined LP in 1994 and has served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP Siding business since January of 2017, will transition to lead Entekra as its President. Neil has done a tremendous job of growing LP Siding business, and he is exactly the kind of leader Entekra needs to reach its potential as an innovative and disruptive building technology.
Second, Jason Ringblom, who joined LP in 2004 and has served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of LP's OSB and EWP businesses since January 2017 will succeed Neil as EVP and General Manager of the Siding business. Jason has been instrumental in transforming LP's OSB business, increasing its operational agility and efficiency while shifting the focus from commodity products to value-added Structural Solutions. Jason is rejoining the Siding business, where he previously held a leadership position with our sales team. So he's very familiar with the SmartSide customer values and value proposition. Neil and Jason's leadership of Siding and OSB has been critically important to LP's ongoing strategic transformation.
I am extremely grateful for their contributions, and I am confident they will continue to deliver outstanding results in their new roles. Both of them have built world-class teams that lead and execute their business strategies. And I know neither team will skip a beat during this transition. Both Jason and Neil will remain in their current roles for a brief transition period until we appoint a new EVP and General Manager for OSB and EWP, a process that we hope to complete soon.
With that, I will turn the call over to Alan for a more detailed discussion of LP's financial results for the third quarter as well as an update on our capital allocation strategy and our outlook for Q4 and the full year."

Before I dive into the financial results for the quarter, I'd like to add my personal thanks and congratulations to both Neil and Jason. LP's results for the past several quarters, even years are due in no small part to their leadership, and I'm confident they'll be equally impactful in their new roles.  
As Brad said, the third quarter of 2021 was LP's second best quarter ever. Page 7 of today's presentation summarizes these results compared to the third quarter of last year. Revenue increased by 53% from almost $800 million last year to $1.2 billion this year. Just over half of this increase, $225 million was the result of higher OSB prices. Siding added $49 million to which EWP, South America and Entekra collectively added a further $148 million in revenue. EBITDA increased by 90% year-over-year from $273 million to $522 million. OSB prices and Siding growth added $225 million and $31 million, respectively. South America and EWP added a further $60 million.  
However, inflation in wages, raw materials and freight costs increased by $58 million compared to last year's deflationary environment and costs for the Houlton conversion and the Peace Valley restart totaled $10 million in the quarter.  
The waterfall on Slide 8 adds year-over-year revenue and EBITDA detail for the Siding segment. Siding Solutions revenue grew by 19%, with both volume and price increasing by 9% year-over-year. The Siding team shipped 432 million square feet of SmartSide in the third quarter made possible by a remarkably efficient production and shipping in response to unrelenting demand. And quite frankly, shipments of 432 million square feet in a quarter is more than we thought possible prior to the additional capacity of Houlton coming online next year.
On the cost side, we have accelerated our investments in selling and marketing after sharply curtailing them last year during COVID. We intend to continue investing at this rate in the fourth quarter and beyond to drive demand creation, particularly for ExpertFinish, in anticipation of the Houlton startup. OEE improved to 89% for a net transformation impact of $33 million in EBITDA. Inflation of raw materials, mostly resin and paper, added $18 million of costs and freight costs increased by $10 million.
After running our mills at near maximum capacity for more than a year, we completed some necessary sustaining maintenance projects at a total cost of $7 million in the quarter. One such project that began at quarter end and is now almost complete, is a press rebuild at our siding mill in Swan Valley, Manitoba, the impact of which will mostly be felt in the fourth quarter. We also incurred $3 million of conversion costs at Houlton. The resulting EBITDA of $73 million is therefore down $3 million from 2020, bringing the quarterly EBITDA margin to 23% or 27% on a year-to-date basis.
The chart on Slide 9 show that revenue for Siding Solutions continues to grow faster than single-family housing starts on a trailing 12-month basis, with Siding revenue growing by 33%, while starts increased by 23%. The pie charts show continued growth in innovative Siding products like ExpertFinish, smooth siding, shakes and corners. For the third quarter, these new higher value-added products made up 10% of Siding volume, 15% of Siding revenue and contributed 3 points of the 9% price increases for the segment.
Slide 10 shows the quarter in more detail for our OSB business. OSB prices fell steeply in the first weeks of the third quarter before stabilizing in August and are down sequentially from record highs. However, compared to last year, higher prices added $225 million of revenue and EBITDA. On our last quarterly call, we guided to OSB revenue being about 10% below the second quarter or around $700 million, provided that OSB prices remained steady at the levels published the previous Friday by Random Lengths. As we now know, of course, prices continue to fall from that point before rebounding. By quarter end, the actual average weekly Random Lengths price for 7/16 sheathing was approximately $100 lower than it would have been had prices remained flat after our last call. And at roughly 1 billion square feet of quarterly capacity, the $100 price difference would imply a revenue difference of about $100 million, yielding an adjusted estimate of about $600 million in revenue, which it turns out is precisely the result in third quarter revenue. 
Price again swamps other factors in the OSB waterfall, but I will address the other components briefly. Volume was up in the quarter due to production at Peace Valley offsetting the onetime costs associated with its restart. OEE in the quarter was down compared to the prior year, partly due to resin substitutions and partly due to maintenance and production issues, resulting in a $4 million hit to EBITDA. The same inflationary pressures we discussed for Siding also impacted OSB with resin and freight inflation costing $15 million and $11 million in the quarter, respectively.
I wouldn't normally point this out, but the freight Variance is abnormally large this quarter, so I should note that whereas Siding is typically sold at delivered prices, freight costs in OSB are generally passed through. Therefore, the OSB freight cost increase in the quarter is offset within the price component with no net EBITDA impact. So OSB ended the quarter with $600 million in revenue, $381 million in EBITDA and another remarkable quarter of cash generation.
And while not shown in waterfall charts, EWP and LP South America had remarkable quarters as well, with strong demand and pricing more than offsetting increases in raw material costs, which brings me to a summary of cash flows in the quarter and a capital allocation update. Operating cash flow was a little over $500 million in the third quarter. After $68 million in capital spending, we returned $416 million to shareholders, comprising $399 million in share repurchases and $17 million in dividends, and we ended the quarter with cash balances essentially unchanged.
LP repurchased 6.8 million shares during the third quarter, ending the quarter with 90.2 million shares outstanding. As of yesterday, we have spent a further $156 million since quarter end to repurchase 2.5 million more shares. This brings the remaining balance of our $1 billion authorization to $157 million. And our current number of shares outstanding as of right now to slightly under $88 million.
Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share and authorized a further $500 million for ongoing share repurchases, bringing our total repurchase authorization as of today to a little over $650 million.
Slide 11 shows updated guidance for full year capital investment as well as revenue and EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter. We are lowering our full year CapEx guidance slightly to account for longer lead times and contractor availability issues. While Houlton remains on schedule, the completion of some of the smaller projects may unfortunately be pushed into early 2022. Raw materials and logistics, particularly flatbed freight, continue to exhibit tight supply and elevated prices. While we are currently able to procure all the resin and other raw materials that we need, inflationary pressures may dampen margins somewhat in the near term for all segments.
With respect to Siding, on the last call, we guided to revenue growth of 10% for the second half of the year and a full year EBITDA margin of about 25%. Despite the business growing in the third quarter at twice the rate necessary to hit that guidance, I'm reiterating both aspects of that guidance today. And here's why: while the price growth experienced in the third quarter is certainly sustainable, similar volume growth in the fourth quarter is unlikely simply because the much-needed maintenance projects, especially the press rebuild at Swan Valley, have temporarily lowered production. 
The EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter would probably have been similar to that of the third quarter, with price increases once again offsetting raw material inflation, if not for 2 factors. The first is the lower production capacity. The lost volume has a high variable margin of around 50%. And the second is the cost of other investments we're making for future growth, increased selling and marketing, the Houlton conversion, the Swan press rebuild and other critical maintenance and growth projects designed to derisk and debottleneck operations will add roughly $25 million of discretionary costs in the fourth quarter. 
Although these actions will result in an EBITDA lower than both the third quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, the resulting full year EBITDA margin still meets our long-term target of 25%, which was set at that level precisely because of the need to make periodic investments such as these. Now we're confident that these actions position the business very well for additional growth in 2022, particularly when Houlton comes online.
OSB is somewhat simpler with volume increases from Peace Valley, partially offsetting sequentially lower OSB prices. Provided the quarter-to-date average OSB price holds throughout the fourth quarter, the resulting OSB revenue will be down about 30% sequentially from the third quarter. 
So in conclusion, given the usual caveats about sudden changes in demand, unexpected changes in raw material price or availability or other unforeseeable factors, the resulting EBITDA for the fourth quarter should be somewhat above $200 million. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Really proud of the business improvement, really over the last 3 years, but particularly this year. Mark, there's no question, some of that margin is aided by the pricing, the world wide price of OSB -- the price of OSB in North America. You can imagine that imports to South America diminished from North America when we had the kind of pricing environment we had up here this year, which allows us to push price down there. I do think there is a ratchet up in performance in South America, but there will -- I do believe there will be some pricing moderation as we see the decline in pricing or experienced the decline in pricing in North America. But the magnitude of price increase and the magnitude of price decrease in South America historically has been a lot less volatile than what we've seen in North America.
But I do think we should expect some moderation of margin down there. Now there is a component of that margin improvement, though, that is sustainable and that's operational OEE aspect of the business. That -- historically, that has been our poorest OEE division if you type -- include Siding in North American OSB as divisions or segments. They've made really good movement over the past year, and there's a lot of room for future improvement. And then we also have a pretty aggressive for the scale of that business, capital reinvestment strategy down there. We're primarily focused on improved machine reliability. 
And so there's room for us to continue to improve South America from a cost standpoint. And then I guess there's a little bit of latency on how pricing kind of gets into equilibrium. And I don't think we'll know that for a quarter or 2 in South America, but we'll obviously continue to report out on that. 
On Entekra -- Entekra is very strategic to us. I really am pleased with the progress we've made in that business over this past year, but I think that they're speaking of step change, Mark, there's a step change needed. I believe we have validated market acceptance. I've said that on this call before, but we really have to bring a level of confidence in to just the overall operations of that business and the delivery of the value proposition. 
So we made a couple moves in the quarter. We -- one that we mentioned on the call, we did put one of our very experienced plant managers into the Modesto facility and is now the plant manager. And then as we talked about, we're moving Neil over there to be President. So we see this as a very significant strategic opportunity for us. We think the timing is right to really put some concentrated resources on it. Obviously, Neil has a great track record over his tenure in Siding of growing that business, of building a really strong team that was capable of doing that. And we want to kind of lift and place him over in Entekra to see the same kind of rapid business improvement. 
And then we're very blessed to have a strong bench. Jason has spent portions of his career associated with, particularly, with the sales side of our Siding business. So I feel really good about Jason's ability to continue the good performance in Siding as well. So -- but it does -- I guess the nature of your question is what does this say about Entekra. It says that we see it as a huge opportunity, and we're really getting serious about getting a manufacturing competency so that we can continue to grow that business. 
We'll probably -- we'll have revenue in the business of around $100 million this year of Entekra. We're close to breakeven EBITDA, particularly in the second half of the year. So I mean, $100 million from $0, 18 months ago, does show that the revenue generation capacity of this business. And -- so we're excited about turning that into a growth engine that is creating value. And that's Neil's job is to get that done as quickly as possible."

There's 2 components to the growth in sales and marketing expense in Siding and one of them is that we cut it pretty severely Q2 of last year. So some of that is just a recovery back to somewhat of a normal run rate that we had been on. We, obviously, cut it Q2 of last year thinking that would not be experiencing the reality of what the COVID impact on housing, but also just to calibrate us all, the prefinished strategy, the ExpertFinish strategy is one -- is very different from selling into new home construction. 
Ultimately, the decision is made on siding choice in the home with the home homeowner deeply involved in that. So it's a bit more of a consumer sale. And so our marketing expense is primarily focused about building brand identity around prefinished -- our ExpertFinish brand, supporting, repair and remodel, contractor base around making that sale and just getting that exposure and placement that we need to be a national presence as far as prefinish siding. 
So it is out of step historically with what we've done from a marketing percentage or marketing dollar standpoint, but very consistent with what is required in order to have an effective repair and remodel present in siding. 
Now part of your question was, well if you're -- I think the nature of that question, John, was if -- you're oversold now, so is now the time to be spending it? We think so. It does take a little while to build the kind of brand credibility. And with the investments we're making around capacity expansion, we do want to be ahead of that a little bit on the marketing side so that when Houlton comes up, particularly on the East Coast, a big repair and remodel market. And then Sagola following that, we've got some momentum on the sales and marketing side -- the marketing side, in particular, to support that extra capacity. 
It's a judgment game, honestly, around how and when the magnitude of that marketing spend. But I feel like we do have a credible -- a very credible team that knows how to spend those dollars wisely. So I'm confident of that, that any mistake would be maybe we'd get ahead of it a little bit. But I do feel like it's a minimal investment compared to the size of the capacity expansion capital and makes a lot of sense, given our recent history of sales growth and our ability to support that kind of level of spend in support of the brand."

If we get a slowdown in construction over that period of time, which would typically be weather-related, if it happens, we could see more of a return to a normal inventory situation by the time we get to the new year. 
I don't see any scenario where the channel gets heavy with inventory, though. I think -- I just think there's too much catch-up to do given how we started this year for that to happen.
