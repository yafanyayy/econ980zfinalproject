I will provide comments on the tremendous progress we made on several strategic priorities during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the start of 2021. But first, let me give my appreciation to our employees and partners around the world who rose to the occasion day after day in the face of extraordinary circumstances. 2020 presented us with the challenges on the global health pandemic social and political unrest and the worst economic conditions in many years. Despite these challenges, our teams remain focused on health and safety, delivering for our customers, strengthening the financial position of the company and continuing to drive our strategic priorities forward. It is because of our commitment of our employees that today we are able to announce the strong financial results as well as significant progress on critical milestones to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company equipped for growth and value creation. 
Starting on Slide 2, on February 1, we announced the completion of the merger of our N&B business with IFF, creating an $11 billion industry-leading company in the Food & beverage, home and personal care, and health and wellness markets. The new IFF will have unmatched capabilities to deliver for customers with leading positions in markets such as nutrition, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. The combination of these complementary portfolios puts IFF at the forefront of highly valued consumer ingredients companies that work closely with customers to meet the growing demand in areas such as all-natural, clean label and sustainability. The combined management team has planned and prepared for this integration, and they are committed to delivering for all stakeholders. They are already executing on a playbook to capture both the cost and revenue synergies enabled by the combination. I am now on the IFF board, and I look forward to coming into the lead director role this spring to continue overseeing the transformation of IFF. 
This transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. Earlier this month, we received about 7.3 billion in cash, which enables us to further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our long-term debt and gives us the flexibility to continue generating shareholder value. 
As you know, we separated the N&B business through a split-off transaction in which DuPont shareholders were given the option to tender their DuPont shares in exchange for shares in IFF at a ratio of 0.718 shares of IFF for every share of DuPont. The exchange offer was fully subscribed, and all shares that were tendered were retired by DuPont resulting in a reduction of 197 million shares or approximately 27% of our outstanding shares. This was a very efficient process for DuPont to get shares out of the market with 0 cash outlay. In closing, customers are excited about the potential this strategic combination can deliver in terms of being a partner of choice, R&D capability and innovation. 
Additionally, our N&B colleagues are energized by the opportunities before them, and we wish them continued success as they embark on this exciting new journey. 
Slide 3 highlights the impact of other actions we took throughout 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet and position the company to continue generating shareholder value through a disciplined financial policy. As Lori and I came into our roles in February of last year, and with initial indications of a global pandemic soon thereafter, we quickly implemented actions to improve working capital and tension capital expenditures across each business and function. 
We achieved an 850 million improvement in working capital and reduced capital expenditures to $1 billion, a reduction of nearly 300 million from our initial targets for the year. Combined, this action enables free cash flow conversion of more than 150% for the year. These actions, combined with proceeds from noncore divestitures, enabled us to close the year with 0 commercial paper balances, a reduction of more than $1.8 billion. We expect to further reduce our debt balances by using 5 billion of the cash received from the IFF deal. We have already retired our $3 billion term loan and plan to redeem the 2 billion notes in May. 
We closed the year with greater than 2.5 billion of available cash, and as I mentioned, we expect to have $2.3 billion of cash remaining from the IFF transaction. Combined with the continued strong cash generation and further proceeds from noncore divestitures, we are heading into 2021 in a very favorable liquidity position with no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2023. 
As we look to uses of our available cash in 2021, our financial policy will remain disciplined and balance maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing the company through investments in CapEx and R&D, acting on strategic M&A targets and returning value to our shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating, and are pleased that we have a stable rating from all the major agencies. We also look to continue our CapEx at about 5% of sales, and R&D spending at about 4% of sales for 2021. 
With regards to dividends, we intend to maintain our current quarterly per share dividend of $0.30 per share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%, and we will work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings. 
Finally, share repurchases remain an important component of our financial policy, and we intend to resume buybacks utilizing our existing plan, which still provides authorization up to $1 billion. We are also actively evaluating a couple of acquisition targets, which will enable even further acceleration of growth in key end markets. As we move through the year, we will redeploy our excess capital in ways which maximize shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 4, we also recently signed agreements to sell our Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses, and we expect these transactions to close by mid-2021. Combined with the sale of the Biomaterials business, We anticipate more than $900 million in pretax proceeds from noncore divestitures this year. 
Our priority of active portfolio management has focused our portfolio and generated significant cash for the company. Since June 2019, we have divested or signed agreements to divest 9 businesses in addition to the separation of N&B generating over $2 billion in gross proceeds. Additionally, exiting these businesses removes a significant amount of cyclicality from the DuPont portfolio and eliminates much of the volatility that was often in our noncore results. 
With the agreements on Clean Tech and Solamet, we have divested a substantial portion of the noncore segment. We will wind down the noncore segment reporting in the first quarter of 2021 and report our results in 3 reportable segments going forward, as we announced last week. 
I'll ask Lori to provide more color on our new segments as well as detail on our financial performance, but let me close with a few comments on the settlement agreement that DuPont and Corteva reached with Chemours. I am pleased that we have reached an agreement that I believe is in the best interest of all 3 companies. For DuPont, there were a few key principles. First, it was important that any settlement agreement capped our share of any potential liabilities as a defined amount. We also have a long-term agreement with the building of an escrow account over the term to provide stakeholders of all 3 entities the confidence that the parties did agreement will be able to satisfy their respective obligations if they were to materialize in the future. The agreement we announced met these principles, and was a key step in reducing the uncertainty around potential legacy [indiscernible] liabilities. 
The other aspect of what we announced a few weeks ago was the settlement of the remaining Ohio multi-district PFOA litigation. Our portion of the settlement is $27 million. To be clear, we continue to believe any exposure for DuPont related to potential legacy PFOS liabilities is contained due to heritage DuPont's limited manufacture and use of PFOA, and the fact that we never made firefighting foam. Having agreement with Chemours and Corteva enables us to work together as we move forward. 
With that, let me turn it over to Lori."

With the completion of the N&B transaction on February 1 and the substantial progress we made on noncore divestitures, we announce our new segment reporting structure for DuPont going forward. We will be aligned around 3 busi",1291,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning. With the completion of the N&B transaction on February 1 and the substantial progress we made on noncore divestitures, we announce our new segment reporting structure for DuPont going forward. We will be aligned around 3 business reporting segments: Electronics & Industrial, Water & Protection and Mobility & Materials. 
Our new segment structure combines businesses with common financial characteristics, enabling clear line of sight and more effective allocation of resources across the company. Each business has a meaningful growth profile with the management team that understands how to best execute on its priorities and deliver for shareholders. 
We will move the following businesses to the newly named Electronics & Industrial segment: Calves, Best Bell, Medical Silicones and Molycoat, each previously reported in our T&I segment. We will move the Tasian Films joint venture, the Micro Circuit Materials business and the Tedlar business to our T&I segment, which will be remained Mobility & Materials. Each of these were previously reported in our noncore segment. Safety & Construction will be renamed Water & Protection to highlight our market-leading water business that we have grown both organically and inorganically over the past few years. 
As Ed mentioned, we will wrap up the noncore segment as part of our first core reporting. We will report the results of the Biomaterials, Clean Tech and Solamet businesses in our corporate segment until the divestitures are complete. 
I'll cover our fourth quarter results on Slide 6. As Ed did earlier, I'd like to acknowledge the significant efforts of our teams in delivering a strong fourth quarter, a capstone to what was an incredibly productive year. We set working capital and CapEx targets and challenged our teams to enable the reduction of commercial paper balances 0 at year-end to improve our leverage heading into 2021. Our teams delivered once again. 
Net sales of $5.3 billion were flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019 on an organic basis and ahead of expectations we had set at the start of the quarter. Demand for our technologies in smartphones and semiconductors remained robust through the quarter with no seasonal decline in smartphones as we typically see in the fourth quarter. 
Also contributing to the strong fourth quarter was further recovery in the automotive market. At the start of the quarter, industry benchmark suggested fourth quarter auto builds would be down low single digits. However, with over 23 million automobiles produced globally, the fourth quarter was the strongest production quarter of the year, up 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and up about 14% versus the third quarter of 2020. Our teams navigated a challenging raw material environment across the polymer space to deliver volume growth in line with auto build on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
The end markets within S&C were very similar to the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. Demand for our protective garments continued to be strong, with garment sales up nearly 50% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The aramid side of our safety business was up versus the third quarter on a sequential basis, but continues to see year-over-year declines in volume as a result of the pandemic impacting demand for aerospace, oil and gas, and other select industrial applications. 
Similarly, the environment in Shelter Solutions remained consistent with what we saw in the third quarter, with strength in do-it-yourself applications and continued recovery in residential construction offset by softer commercial construction demand. Shelter sales were up slightly on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. And demand for water filtration technologies remained strong across the world. However, in our fourth quarter results were impacted by the timing of some shipments at year-end, resulting primarily from orders associated with capital projects. We will capture this demand in our first quarter results and return to mid- to high single-digit growth. 
Likewise, results for the N&B segment were in line with our expectations with ongoing demand strength in probiotics and home and personal care markets, offset by the continued softness in biorefinery and microbial control. 
From an earnings perspective, we also delivered a strong quarter, driven by improved volumes and the delivery of approximately $130 million of nonmanufacturing cost savings, which enabled expanded EBITDA margins in each of our core segments in the quarter. Excluding approximately $160 million of discrete gains in the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered operating leverage with mid-single-digit operating EBITDA growth. 
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 31.6% on strong volumes and cost reductions. T&I delivered 310 basis points of operating EBITDA expansion on higher volumes, tight cost control and lower raw material costs offset by year-over-year pricing pressure. Likewise, S&C drove operating margin expansion of 40 basis points through cost control and favorable product mix, more than offsetting the impact of lower volumes. 
N&B operating margins expanded 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2019 led by favorable product mix and nonmanufacturing cost control, more than offsetting raw material price increases, and costs associated with the planned slowdown of production across the N&B network to properly manage working capital. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.95 per share was flat with the prior year. Savings from both structural and temporary cost reductions and benefits from a lower tax rate were offset by pricing headwinds and a headwind of approximately $0.17 associated with the prior year discrete items. We also delivered robust free cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by controlled CapEx and working capital improvements. We closed the year with CapEx on target at $1 billion and approximately $850 million in working capital improvement, well above our target of $500 million for the year. 
Looking forward over the medium term, we continue to believe we have additional opportunity to improve our working capital turnover, primarily through better supply chain management through the use of data analytics. 
Slide 7 provides our financial outlook for both the first quarter and full year 2021.Our guidance reflects DuPont on the new basics, excluding N&B as it will be reflected as discontinued operations when we report our results. We have provided recast first quarter and full year 2020 results, excluding N&B for comparison purposes. Later this month, we will release fully recast segment results for 2018 and and all quarters in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the segment realignment, the elimination of the noncore segment and reflecting N&B as discontinued operations. Our guidance also includes a full year results for the 3 noncore businesses we have signed agreements to sell, and we will reset expectations as they close. 
For the full year, we expect net sales of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint and operating EBITDA of $3.83 billion to $3.93 billion, an increase of 13% at the midpoint. We expect operating EBITDA margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points driven by the impact of improved volumes and the remaining benefits of our structural cost actions we put in place last year. These gains will be partially offset by anticipated return of some 2020 temporary cost reductions. Adjusted EPS of $3.30 to $3.45, an increase of 68% at the midpoint versus 2020 adjusted EPS of $2.01 per share reflects stronger segment earnings and lower interest expense, which is enabled by the paydown of our debt balances, including commercial paper. Our adjusted EPS also reflects the reduced share count resulting from the exchange offer that closed on January 29 in connection with the separation of N&B. As a reminder, this took out about 197 million DuPont shares. This results in a weighted average share count for the year of 555 million which excludes the benefit of any future buybacks. 
With that, let me turn it over to Leland to open the Q&A."

So we feel like we're going to have very good results organically as we move forward in the new configuration. 
The way we're looking at M&A, I'd say, look, there's 2 targets that we're presently working on. I don't know if we'll be able to consummate them or not. We're not going to stretch to get them. We're going to make sure the numbers work for us, and we're going to make sure the numbers work on the cost synergy side, not taking into account revenue synergies even though the couple that we're working on do have revenue synergies. So we'll see how that plays out. We're actively in that right now. They're right down the middle of the plate in a couple of areas that we already participate in. We're not going to do anything on the M&A side that's a new segment or anything like that. We feel like there's some good consolidation opportunities where we have our strengths and right where we have great relationships with customers. So that's how we're looking at it. 
And we -- as we highlighted, we are -- even though we just took 27% of our shares out of the market not using any cash, we do have still $1 billion open on our authorization. So we're going to get back in the market and start repurchasing shares. We have a Board meeting coming up in the next month. And that will be a topic that we will have with the Board, a share buyback versus mix of M&A that we're planning on doing during the year."

And quite frankly, the whole electronics segment is running full tilt as Lori had mentioned. Even the smartphone demand where we have additional content now because of 5G, that did not even soften up in the fourth quarter and usually seasonally that even declined. 
So seeing -- we're pumping out as much as we can, but definitely, there's some slight slowdown, but the car production is still hot and heavy. You can look at the 650,000 unit reduction. And hopefully, that works its way. Those issues work its way through during the first quarter. So we're seeing a little bit there. But again, I think our forecast is very solid for what we're going to do in the electronics business in the semi. 
We're also seeing some headwinds on raw materials in the T&I business, which also somewhat relates to the auto business. So we lost a little bit of volume in the fourth quarter, and we'll lose a little bit of volume in the first quarter because of those constraints. But again, our forecast still is very solid, and we're pretty much running full tilt there also."

And so we were down about 4% in Q4. We're looking at about 2% in Q1. So there is some sequential improvement there. However, we still do expect to be down year-over-year just given that we were still in a bit of a nylon run in the first quarter of 2020. So as we go through the year, as Ed has mentioned, the pricing environment in nylon is constructive. We do have an awesome team that takes advantage of price. So we do expect, as we get to the full year, that you could see positive price momentum as reported for the full year basis. 
Keep in mind, though, there are some raw material headwinds that Ed had mentioned that we're dealing with. So some of that price most likely will be offset by escalating raws, especially as oil price is expected to tick up. There are some raw material headwinds. We will offset, but they could eat into some of the price appreciation that we would see."

Is there anything you can do to solidify that view? And the reason I asked is, in the past, DuPont's supported the initiative to have the PFAS grouping regulated under Circla and under the old Superfund base, Circla allocated costs according to the ability to pay, not necessarily to the contribution to the problem. And thus, is that a potential concern for you with regard to broadening this potential cleanup liability?"

We have been supportive. We've testified in front of Congress that if you designate it as a hazardous substance, we're totally in agreement with that.

We've testified in front of Congress that if you designate it as a hazardous substance, we're totally in agreement with that. We'd rather have a national standard than every state doing their own thing. But remember, under the circular, the superfund designation It's very narrow who is responsible for it. I mean it's where you disposed of the material. And the party responsible either had to be the site owner or the past site owner when it occurred, or the person that arranged to transport it through that location. That is the definition under the Circla which is very narrow. You have to be one of the players that did that. 
DuPont, by the way, we have 4 sites where we used it as a manufacturing agent. And we disposed of it on our own sites with, by the way, approval to do that. One of our sites is 800 acres, one of them was 1,500 acres, and that's why we had so much ground. That's where the disposals occurred. So we're very contained where we did it. 
There's already cleanup going on with government authorities approving what we're doing, and that's been ongoing for quite a few years. And so -- and we never obviously disposed the firefighting foam anywhere in a dump or anything because we didn't make it. So I think -- look, as the facts keep coming out, it will get narrow and narrow here. And then we'll, as I've said before, and I don't want to get into too much detail, it's a little bit proprietary, but we'll look at a way to hopefully contain the firefighting foam issue so our investors understand the limited or no liability that sits there based on what we did as a company. 
And by the way, we're very focused on it. As you can see, we said there was a 3-pronged approach. We just did 2 of the pieces with the announcements we made with the agreement between the 3 companies and settling the rest of the Ohio MDL for really very little in the scheme of things. And so now we'll focus on this firefighting foam piece of it. 
Remember also, we have been sued in states. We don't even have anything in the state. The state of Arizona, the state of New Hampshire, we don't even have a facility there. We didn't do anything there. So the facts will keep coming out here, and then hopefully we'll get resolution, and hopefully something by the end of 2021."

We just had a little bit around a capital project delay and as I had mentioned, logistics. 
As far as visibility is concerned, we have back-end loaded order patterns. And so a lot of the sales go into large capital projects that tend to be pushed to the back end of the quarter.

I will provide comments on the tremendous progress we made on several strategic priorities during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the start of 2021. But first, let me give my appreciation to our employees and partners around the world who rose to the occasion day after day in the face of extraordinary circumstances. 
2020 presented us with the challenges on the global health pandemic, social and political unrest, and the worst economic conditions in many years. Despite these challenges, our teams remained focused on health and safety, delivering for our customers, strengthening the financial position of the company, and continuing to drive our strategic priorities forward. It is because of our commitment of our employees that today we are able to announce the strong financial results as well as significant progress on critical milestones to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company equipped for growth and value creation. 
Starting on Slide 2, on February 1, we announced the completion of the merger of our N&B business with IFF, creating an $11 billion industry-leading company in the Food & Beverage, home and personal care, and health and wellness markets. The new IFF will have unmatched capabilities to deliver for customers with leading positions in markets such as nutrition, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. 
The combination of these complementary portfolios puts IFF at the forefront of highly valued consumer ingredients companies that work closely with customers to meet the growing demand in areas such as all-natural, clean label and sustainability. 
The combined management team has planned and prepared for this integration, and they are committed to delivering for all stakeholders. They are already executing on a playbook to capture both the cost and revenue synergies enabled by the combination. I am now on the IFF board, and I look forward to coming into the lead director role this spring to continue overseeing the transformation of IFF. 
This transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. Earlier this month, we received about 7.3 billion in cash, which enables us to further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our long-term debt and gives us the flexibility to continue generating shareholder value. 
As you know, we separated the N&B business through a split-off transaction in which DuPont shareholders were given the option to tender their DuPont shares in exchange for shares in IFF at a ratio of 0.718 shares of IFF for every share of DuPont. The exchange offer was fully subscribed, and all shares that were tendered were retired by DuPont resulting in a reduction of 197 million shares or approximately 27% of our outstanding shares. This was a very efficient process for DuPont to get shares out of the market with 0 cash outlay. In closing, customers are excited about the potential this strategic combination can deliver in terms of being a partner of choice, R&D capability and innovation. 
Additionally, our N&B colleagues are energized by the opportunities before them, and we wish them continued success as they embark on this exciting new journey. 
Slide 3 highlights the impact of other actions we took throughout 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet and position the company to continue generating shareholder value through a disciplined financial policy. 
As Lori and I came into our roles in February of last year, and with the initial indications of a global pandemic soon thereafter, we quickly implemented actions to improve working capital and tension capital expenditures across each business and function. 
We achieved an 850 million improvement in working capital and reduced capital expenditures to $1 billion, a reduction of nearly $300 million from our initial targets for the year. Combined, these actions enables free cash flow conversion of more than 150% for the year. These actions, combined with proceeds from noncore divestitures, enabled us to close the year with 0 commercial paper balances, a reduction of more than $1.8 billion. We expect to further reduce our debt balances by using 5 billion of the cash received from the IFF deal. We have already retired our $3 billion term loan and plan to redeem the 2 billion notes in May. 
We closed the year with greater than 2.5 billion of available cash, and as I mentioned, we expect to have $2.3 billion of cash remaining from the IFF transaction. Combined with the continued strong cash generation and further proceeds from noncore divestitures, we are heading into 2021 in a very favorable liquidity position with no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2023. 
As we look to uses of our available cash in 2021, our financial policy will remain disciplined and balanced maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing the company through investments in CapEx and R&D, acting on strategic M&A targets and returning value to our shareholders. 
We remain committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating, and are pleased that we have a stable rating from all the major agencies. We also look to continue our CapEx at about 5% of sales, and R&D spending at about 4% of sales for 2021. 
With regards to dividends, we intend to maintain our current quarterly per share dividend of $0.30 per share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%, and we will work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings. 
Finally, share repurchases remain an important component of our financial policy, and we intend to resume buybacks utilizing our existing plan, which still provides authorization up to $1 billion. We are also actively evaluating a couple of acquisition targets, which will enable even further acceleration of growth in key end markets. As we move through the year, we will redeploy our excess capital in ways which maximize shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 4, we also recently signed agreements to sell our Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses, and we expect these transactions to close by mid-2021. Combined with the sale of the Biomaterials business, we anticipate more than $900 million in pretax proceeds from noncore divestitures this year. 
Our priority of active portfolio management has focused our portfolio and generated significant cash for the company. Since June 2019, we have divested or signed agreements to divest 9 businesses in addition to the separation of N&B generating over $2 billion in gross proceeds. Additionally, exiting these businesses removes a significant amount of cyclicality from the DuPont portfolio and eliminates much of the volatility that was often in our noncore results. 
With the agreements on Clean Tech and Solamet, we have divested a substantial portion of the noncore segment. We will wind down the noncore segment reporting in the first quarter of 2021 and report our results in 3 reportable segments going forward, as we announced last week. 
I'll ask Lori to provide more color on our new segments as well as detail on our financial performance, but let me close with a few comments on the settlement agreement that DuPont and Corteva reached with Chemours. I am pleased that we have reached an agreement that I believe is in the best interest of all 3 companies. For DuPont, there were a few key principles. First, it was important that any settlement agreement capped our share of any potential liabilities at a defined amount. We also have a long-term agreement with the building of an escrow account over the term to provide stakeholders of all 3 entities the confidence that the parties did agreement will be able to satisfy their respective obligations if they were to materialize in the future. The agreement we announced met these principles, and was a key step in reducing the uncertainty around potential legacy PFOS liabilities. 
The other aspect of what we announced a few weeks ago was the settlement of the remaining Ohio multi-district PFOA litigation. Our portion to this settlement is $27 million. To be clear, we continue to believe any exposure for DuPont related to potential legacy PFOS liabilities is contained due to heritage DuPont's limited manufacture and use of PFOA, and the fact that we never made firefighting foam. Having agreement with Chemours and Corteva enables us to work together as we move forward. 
With that, let me turn it over to Lori."

With the completion of the N&B transaction on February 1 and the substantial progress we made on noncore divestitures, we announced our new segment reporting structure for DuPont going forward. We will be aligned around 3 bus",1289,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning. With the completion of the N&B transaction on February 1 and the substantial progress we made on noncore divestitures, we announced our new segment reporting structure for DuPont going forward. We will be aligned around 3 business reporting segments: Electronics & Industrial, Water & Protection and Mobility & Materials. 
Our new segment structure combines businesses with common financial characteristics, enabling clear line of sight and more effective allocation of resources across the company. Each business has a meaningful growth profile with the management team that understands how to best execute on its priorities and deliver for shareholders. 
We will move the following businesses to the newly named Electronics & Industrial segment: Kalrez, Vespel, Medical Silicones and MOLYKOTE, each previously reported in our T&I segment. We will move the Teijin Films joint venture, the Micro Circuit Materials business and the Tedlar business to our T&I segment, which will be remained Mobility & Materials. Each of these were previously reported in our noncore segment. 
Safety & Construction will be renamed Water & Protection to highlight our market-leading water business that we have grown both organically and inorganically over the past few years. 
As Ed mentioned, we will wrap up the noncore segment as part of our first core reporting. We will report the results of the Biomaterials, Clean Tech and Solamet businesses in our corporate segment until the divestitures are complete. 
I'll cover our fourth quarter results on Slide 6. As Ed did earlier, I'd like to acknowledge the significant efforts of our teams in delivering a strong fourth quarter, a capstone to what was an incredibly productive year. We set working capital and CapEx targets and challenged our teams to enable the reduction of commercial paper balances 0 at year-end to improve our leverage heading into 2021. Our teams delivered once again. 
Net sales of $5.3 billion were flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019 on an organic basis and ahead of expectations we had set at the start of the quarter. Demand for our technologies in smartphones and semiconductors remained robust through the quarter with no seasonal decline in smartphones as we typically see in the fourth quarter. 
Also contributing to the strong fourth quarter was further recovery in the automotive market. At the start of the quarter, industry benchmark suggested fourth quarter auto builds would be down low single digits. However, with over 23 million automobiles produced globally, the fourth quarter was the strongest production quarter of the year, up 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and up about 14% versus the third quarter of 2020. 
Our teams navigated a challenging raw materials environment across the polymer space to deliver volume growth in line with auto build on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
The end markets within S&C were very similar to the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. Demand for our protective garments continued to be strong, with garment sales up nearly 50% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The aramid side of our safety business was up versus the third quarter on a sequential basis, but continues to see year-over-year declines in volume as a result of the pandemic impacting demand for aerospace, oil and gas, and other select industrial applications. 
Similarly, the environment in Shelter Solutions remained consistent with what we saw in the third quarter, with strength in do-it-yourself applications and continued recovery in residential construction offset by softer commercial construction demand. 
Shelter sales were up slightly on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. And demand for water filtration technologies remained strong across the world. However, in our fourth quarter results were impacted by the timing of some shipments at year-end, resulting primarily from orders associated with capital projects. We will capture this demand in our first quarter results and return to mid- to high single-digit growth. 
Likewise, results for the N&B segment were in line with our expectations with ongoing demand strength in probiotics and home and personal care markets, offset by the continued softness in biorefinery and microbial control. 
From an earnings perspective, we also delivered a strong quarter, driven by improved volumes and the delivery of approximately $130 million of nonmanufacturing cost savings, which enabled expanded EBITDA margins in each of our core segments in the quarter. Excluding approximately $160 million of discrete gains in the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered operating leverage with mid-single-digit operating EBITDA growth. 
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 31.6% on strong volumes and cost reductions. T&I delivered 310 basis points of operating EBITDA expansion on higher volumes, tight cost control and lower raw material costs offset by year-over-year pricing pressure. Likewise, S&C drove operating margin expansion of 40 basis points through cost control and favorable product mix, more than offsetting the impact of lower volumes. 
N&B operating margins expanded 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2019 led by favorable product mix and nonmanufacturing cost control, more than offsetting raw material price increases, and costs associated with the planned slowdown of production across the N&B network to properly manage working capital. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.95 per share was flat with the prior year. Savings from both structural and temporary cost reductions and benefits from a lower tax rate were offset by pricing headwinds and a headwind of approximately $0.17 associated with the prior year discrete items. 
We also delivered robust free cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by controlled CapEx and working capital improvements. We closed the year with CapEx on target at $1 billion and approximately $850 million in working capital improvement, well above our target of $500 million for the year. 
Looking forward over the medium term, we continue to believe we have additional opportunity to improve our working capital turnover, primarily through better supply chain management through the use of data analytics. 
Slide 7 provides our financial outlook for both the first quarter and full year 2021.Our guidance reflects DuPont on the new basics, excluding N&B as it will be reflected as discontinued operations when we report our results. 
We have provided recast first quarter and full year 2020 results, excluding N&B for comparison purposes. Later this month, we will release fully recast segment results for 2018 and all quarters in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the segment realignment, the elimination of the noncore segment and reflecting N&B as discontinued operations. Our guidance also includes a full year results for the 3 noncore businesses we have signed agreements to sell, and we will reset expectations as they close. 
For the full year, we expect net sales of $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint and operating EBITDA of $3.83 billion to $3.93 billion, an increase of 13% at the midpoint.
We expect operating EBITDA margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points driven by the impact of improved volumes and the remaining benefits of our structural cost actions we put in place last year. These gains will be partially offset by anticipated return of some 2020 temporary cost reductions. 
Adjusted EPS of $3.30 to $3.45, an increase of 68% at the midpoint versus 2020 adjusted EPS of $2.01 per share reflects stronger segment earnings and lower interest expense, which is enabled by the paydown of our debt balances, including commercial paper. 
Our adjusted EPS also reflects the reduced share count resulting from the exchange offer that closed on January 29 in connection with the separation of N&B. 
As a reminder, this took out about 197 million DuPont shares. This results in a weighted average share count for the year of 555 million which excludes the benefit of any future buybacks. 
With that, let me turn it over to Leland to open the Q&A."

So we feel like we're going to have very good results organically as we move forward in the new configuration. 
The way we're looking at M&A, I'd say, look, there's 2 targets that we're presently working on. I don't know if we'll be able to consummate them or not. We're not going to stretch to get them. We're going to make sure the numbers work for us, and we're going to make sure the numbers work on the cost synergy side, not taking into account revenue synergies even though the couple that we're working on do have revenue synergies. 
So we'll see how that plays out. We're actively in that right now. They're right down the middle of the plate in a couple of areas that we already participate in. We're not going to do anything on the M&A side that's a new segment or anything like that. We feel like there's some good consolidation opportunities right where we have our strengths and right where we have great relationships with customers. So that's how we're looking at it. 
And we -- as we highlighted, we are -- even though we just took 27% of our shares out of the market not using any cash, we do have still $1 billion open on our authorization. So we're going to get back in the market and start repurchasing shares. We have a Board meeting coming up in the next month. And that will be a topic that we will have with the Board, a share buyback versus mix of M&A that we're planning on doing during the year."

And quite frankly, the whole electronics segment is running full tilt as Lori had mentioned. Even the smartphone demand where we have additional content now because of 5G that did not even soften up in the fourth quarter and usually seasonally that even declined. 
So seeing -- we're pumping out as much as we can, but definitely, there's some slight slowdown, but the car production is still hot and heavy. You can look at the 650,000 unit reduction. And hopefully, that works its way. Those issues work its way through during the first quarter. So we're seeing a little bit there. But again, I think our forecast is very solid for what we're going to do in the electronics business in the semi. 
We're also seeing some headwinds on raw materials in the T&I business, which also somewhat relates to the auto business. So we lost a little bit of volume in the fourth quarter, and we'll lose a little bit of volume in the first quarter because of those constraints. But again, our forecast still is very solid, and we're pretty much running full tilt there also."

But on the -- specifically to your question on pricing, things have firmed up very well.

So as we go through the year, as Ed has mentioned, the pricing environment in nylon is constructive. We do have an awesome team that takes advantage of price. So we do expect, as we get to the full year that you could see positive price momentum as reported for the full year basis. 
Keep in mind, though, there are some raw material headwinds that Ed had mentioned that we're dealing with.

Is there anything you can do to solidify that view? And the reason I ask is, in the past, DuPont's supported the initiative to have the PFAS grouping regulated under CERCLA and under the old Superfund base, CERCLA allocated costs according to the ability to pay, not necessarily to the contribution to the problem. And thus, is that a potential concern for you with regard to broadening this potential cleanup liability?"

We have been supportive. We've testified in front of Congress that if you designate it as a hazardous substance, we're totally in agreement with that.

We've testified in front of Congress that if you designate it as a hazardous substance, we're totally in agreement with that. We'd rather have a national standard than every state doing their own thing. 
But remember, under the circular, the Superfund designation, it's very narrow who is responsible for it. I mean it's where you disposed of the material. And the party responsible either had to be the site owner or the past site owner when it occurred, or the person that arranged to transport it through that location. That is the definition under the CERCLA which is very narrow. You have to be one of the players that did that. 
DuPont, by the way, we have 4 sites where we used it as a manufacturing agent. And we disposed of it on our own sites with, by the way, approval to do that. One of our sites is 800 acres, one of them was 1,500 acres, and that's why we had so much ground. That's where the disposals occurred. So we're very contained where we did it. 
There's already cleanup going on with government authorities approving what we're doing, and that's been ongoing for quite a few years. And so -- and we never obviously disposed the firefighting foam anywhere in a dump or anything because we didn't make it. 
So I think -- look, as the facts keep coming out, it will get narrow and narrow here. And then we'll, as I've said before, and I don't want to get into too much detail, it's a little bit proprietary, but we'll look at a way to hopefully contain the firefighting foam issue, so our investors understand the limited or no liability that sits there based on what we did as a company. 
And by the way, we're very focused on it. As you can see, we said there was a 3-pronged approach. We just did 2 of the pieces with the announcements we made with the agreement between the 3 companies and settling the rest of the Ohio MDL for really very little in the scheme of things. And so now we'll focus on this firefighting foam piece of it. 
Remember also, we have been sued in states. We don't even have anything in the state. The state of Arizona, the state of New Hampshire, we don't even have a facility there. We didn't do anything there. So the facts will keep coming out here, and then hopefully we'll get resolution, and hopefully something by the end of 2021."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on the strong start that we had to 2021, including the advancement of a number of strategic priorities to make DuPont a more multi-industrial company, equipped for growth and value creation. But first, let me acknowledge the tremendous dedication and determination of our teams around the world as we continue to manage the extraordinary circumstances of this pandemic. The health and well-being of our people remains our top priority. The principles and protocols we've implemented globally and locally to help to protect our people and ensure business continuity as countries face multiple waves of infection and lockdowns. As an innovation-led company, we believe in science and we're encouraging all employees to get vaccinated. And where possible, we're working with public health authorities to facilitate access and distribution. 
Starting on Slide 2, I will note that one of our priorities for generating value is constant operating performance and financial results, this when we announced strong top line and earnings results for the first quarter, both above our expectations. Lori will take you through the details in a moment. I'd like to highlight the 7% organic revenue growth [indiscernible] of our teams to navigate through a challenging environment while facing escalating raw material and logistics costs as well as global supply constraints of key raw materials, most notably in our M&M segment. 
With strong order trends continuing and confidence that our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details regarding this increase shortly. 
In addition to our financial results, we advanced a number of our strategic priorities during the quarter. First, as previously announced, we completed the merger of our Nutrition and Biosciences business with IFF, creating an industry-leading company in food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. As you know, this transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. 
As part of the transaction, we received $7.3 billion cash from IFF and retired slightly more than 197 million coupon shares or about 27% of our outstanding shares at the time with no cash outlay. We strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by paying down our $3 billion term loan, and we will redeem $2 billion of our long-term debt later this month. As a reminder, our next debt maturity will not be due until the fourth quarter of 2023. 
In line with our balanced approach, we returned about $660 million of capital to shareholders during the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Under our existing share buyback program, we executed $500 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. As a reminder, we have about $500 million of repurchase authorization remaining under that program, which we intend to utilize by June 1 of this year. 
Earlier this quarter, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share buyback program, which expires on June 30, 2022. We plan to be opportunistic under the new program as we move throughout the year. 
With respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter as we previously mentioned. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%. And we intend to work with our Board to increase our dividend manually as we grow our earnings. In March, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Layer Performance Materials for $2.3 billion. When completed, a planned acquisition of Layer advance DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. The Layer business will complement our Internet Solutions business within E&I, and it will add critical capabilities and market-leading offerings in thermal management and electromagnetic shielding, which are essential to emerging electronic applications. Our E&I team, along with our customers, are excited for this opportunity. 
We recently received regulatory approval for the transaction in Germany and Brazil and cleared ASR in the U.S. last month. As previously indicated, we expect the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. Finally, we announced previously that we have signed definitive agreements to sell our Biomaterials, Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses. We anticipate receiving more than $900 million in gross proceeds from those divestitures, and we expect those transactions to close in the second half of this year. 
Before turning it over to Lori to go through the details of the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide some context regarding what we saw during the quarter in our key end markets that we serve. Combined, the electronics and automotive markets account for nearly half of our revenues. Electronics continues to perform very well, and auto is recovering nicely from its 2020 lows. 
Within electronics, demand continues to be broad-based as the ramp-up of advanced technology nodes and a need for more memory to servers and data centers has accelerated. The server market, which is a large consumer of semiconductor chips and serve board chemistries, continues to show strength and is expected to remain robust as Internet network traffic continues to grow. Furthermore, the deployment of 5G infrastructure by leading telecom companies in preparation for the next-generation of ultra-high-speed data transmission should help sustained demand for premium smartphones, which is further enhanced by our favorable content play. 
With respect to the automotive end market, demand is well above the low of 2020 but not get back to 2019 levels, which sold 22.9 million vehicles produced in the first quarter and nearly 90 million units for the year. The lack of stable supply of critical components, mainly semiconductors, impact of the ability of the OEMs to produce more vehicles and rebuild inventories during the quarter. It is where we participate in the value chain within M&M, I think it's important to note that our first quarter engineering polymers volumes were not materially affected by the chip shortages as our demand from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers was not lessened as a result of the chip shortage. However, our ability to supply customers was affected by supply constraints of key raw materials, predominantly in our nylon and polyester product lines. This supply situation is gradually improving while we anticipate several critical products will continue to constrain our production through the end of the second quarter. 
We expect that annual lost sales as a result of all material constraints will be captured in the second half of the year. Additionally, we believe that the automotive market will remain strong for the balance of the year as OEMs look to meet robust demand as well as replace global inventories, which are currently below historical averages. 
Moving on to the water and construction end markets. Collectively, these 2 markets account for approximately 20% of our total company sales. Versus first quarter of 2019, demand for advanced water filtration and purification has strengthened, driven by solid growth in Asia Pacific. Strong new residential and commercial water markets as well as industrial and desalination segments has shown growth. 
For construction, North America residential and do-it-yourself markets are up versus first quarter 2019. And while demand within the commercial construction segment has improved from the lows experienced in 2020, it is not back to 2019 levels. 
Lastly, demand within our industrial end markets versus 2019 levels is mixed. Within the electrical infrastructure and private protective garment markets, demand is at or above 2019 levels. However, demand in end markets such as aerospace and oil and gas is still below 2019 levels, but it's improved since the lowest of the second and third quarter of last year. 
Sequentially, our sales into aero and oil and gas were up over 40%. Our diversified portfolio of products and technologies will serve us as the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic. We are continuing to invest at competitive levels in R&D and innovation to further solidify our strong market positions and maintain our position as the partner of choice for our customers in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it over to Lori to walk you through the details of our first quarter financial performance."

Let me cover our first quarter financial results on Slide 4. As I said earlier, I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of our employees throughout the pandemic and our team and navigating through supply chain and logistics [indiscernible] this quarter to deliver following results. Net sales of $4 billion were up 8% versus the first quarter of 2020, up 7% on an organic basis. Overall sales growth was driven by strong volume, up 7% versus first quarter of last year, with volume increases in all 3 reporting segments. Currency provided a 3% tailwind in the quarter led by the euro. Portfolio was a 2% headwind, primarily due to the sale of the [indiscernible] business last year. 
Sales were up in all 3 segments with C&I, M&M and W&P reflecting organic growth of 14%, 8% and 1%, respectively. On a regional basis, organic sales were up 20% in Asia Pacific, our largest region from a sales perspective, with strong results in all 3 reporting segments. Partially offsetting gains in Asia Pacific were organic sales decline in the U.S. and Canada and EMEA of 4% and 2%, respectively. The declines in U.S. and Canada and EMEA were driven by softness for fibers, specifically continued hotness in aerospace and highly [indiscernible] in defense as well as auto builds, which were down in these regions. 
I'll provide more color on our segment top line results on the next slide. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.05 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.99 per share, up 15% and 90%, respectively. Volume gains as well as benefit from prior year cost initiatives and currency drove 160 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and 1.9x operating leverage. Incremental margins for the quarter were 46%. I will walk you through the ETF later call in a moment. 
Our total company gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, flat on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin improvement in E&I and M&M on higher volume and manufacturing productivity is offset by margin decline in W&P, resulting from higher unit rates versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower production volumes of aramid fibers. Gross margin expanded about 280 basis points sequentially with margin improvement in all 3 segments. 
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 33.9% and 420 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on strong volume growth and a onetime discrete gain related to an asset sale. Excluding the benefit of the asset sale, operating EBITDA margin would have been 31.7%, a year-over-year improvement of 240 basis points. 
M&M delivered operating EBITDA margins of 22.9% and 320 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on higher volumes and fitting from productivity actions. In W&P, operating EBITDA was flat versus the year ago period as [indiscernible] cost productivity were offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily higher unit rates, driven by lower production of aramid fibers and increased supply chain costs. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $378 million and $95 million, respectively. These amounts include 1 month of cash flow from our N&B business compared to 3 months of ETE cash flows in the prior year. In addition, cash flow and free cash flow conversion was negatively impacted by working capital headwind of about $300 million, led by higher accounts receivable balances, which were up in line with sales. For the year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion by greater than 90%. 
Slide 5 provides more details on the year-over-year changes in net sales. Leading the way for the quarter was E&I  with 15% volume growth, which had a record quarter. Volume gains were led by double-digit growth on robust demand for semiconductors across Asia. High fabrication utilization rates, driven by demand for new technologies in advance to, along with the ongoing shift in digital transformation drove strong top line growth. In addition, the share name from recent wins for CMP slurry and lithography materials improved results. 
In Interconnect Solutions, double-digit growth reserved by higher material content in premium next-generation carphones partially resulting from timing shifts that select OEM demand shifted earlier in the year to this year. Along with broader printed circuit board market recovery. Within Industrial Solutions, double-digit volume in, in display materials due to new time [indiscernible] more than offset continued weakness in aerospace. The end markets of W&P were generally consistent with our expectations. Sales gains we led by water solutions with double-digit volume growth, reflecting strong demand for our reverse [indiscernible] and ultra filtration technology, led by Asia. Shelter Solutions had low single-digit organic growth versus the year ago period, reflecting high single-digit organic growth in residential construction and retail channels for [indiscernible] health application, offset partially by softness in commercial construction market. 
Within Safety Solutions, [indiscernible] favorable currency and strengthening demand for aramid fibers in industrial and automotive end market was more than offset by continued madness in aerospace and year-over-year volume declines for [indiscernible] Lower [indiscernible] production volumes were a result of higher planned downtime in the quarter. 
Also contributing to strong first quarter top line growth was continued recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about 50% of our M&M segment from an end market perspective. The estimate of 1Q global auto mills were about 20.3 million units during the quarter, up approximately 14% versus the first quarter of last year. As a result, volume in our performance res business was up over 20% versus the year ago period. 
Another bright spot in M&M was improved demand for Micro Circuit Materials, which we aligned the M&M segment earlier this year. These specialized materials, along with adhesive growth, helped drive over 20% organic growth in Advanced Solutions in the year ago period. 
Demand in our engineering commerce business was strong. However, global supply constraints for key raw materials resulted new low single-digit volume decline. Our teams are experienced in navigating trading challenges and work diligently with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate the impact incurred as a result. Additionally, we expect to recover volume lost in the quarter due to these disruptions and nonmaterial constraints are [indiscernible] 
Turning to Slide 6. I mentioned that adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.91 was up 90% versus the prior year. The largest driver of our year-over-year growth was a significantly lower share count, mainly resulting from the N&B exchange offer. The lower share count provided a $0.16 benefit versus the prior year. Excluding the lower share count, adjusted EPS growth was still significant, up 56% versus the prior year. Higher segment earnings provided a $0.13 tailwind in the quarter versus the prior year along with benefits to this year with a lower base tax rate and reduced interest expense. Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.4% was lower than forecasted as a result of a few discrete tax benefits in the quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was significantly lower than last year, resulting from the absence of certain discrete tax headwinds incurred in the prior year. For the full year 2021, we now expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%, down slightly from the 21% to 23% that we previously estimated at the beginning of the year. 
Turning to Slide 7. I will provide some commentary on our balance sheet and cash position. I mentioned earlier that net working capital provided headwinds in free cash flow in the quarter. However, I would like to point out that net working capital productivity gains of about $600 million that we have made in the first quarter of last year, increasing net working capital for about $3.5 million at March 2020 to $2.9 million at March of 2021. Both of these were driving down cash to receivables and inventory. From that perspective, we have stated that we are committed to maintaining our current strong investment-grade credit profile. We started the year with $15.6 million in core debt. And as I mentioned, we paid down a $3 billion term loan in February, and we will pay down $2 billion of debt later this month. 
Moving on to cash. Our cash generated from operations last year put us in a strong cash position coming into this year, and that balance grew with a $7.3 [billion] special cash statement from the transaction with IFF. In addition, we expect to receive over $900 million in gross proceeds this year from the previously announced sale of the noncore businesses. Our current deployment plan for 2021 includes a balanced capital allocation approach. Along with our plans for internal investment this year, we plan to grow retargeted M&A in areas and secular growth and will fund the $2.3 million planned acquisition of NAR Performance Materials with cash on hand. 
We intent to continue to return cash to shareholders. Along with our dividend policy, we completed $500 million of share repurchases in the first quarter at an average price of about $73 per share and will remain opportunistic with our remaining share repurchase authorization throughout the rest of the year. 
On [indiscernible] our targeted maintained cash balance is about $1.5 [million] in real numbers perspective. Our net-net to EBITDA target would be at 2.75x. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed to talk about our financial outlook."

If I may, I don't think our normal cyclicality plays out this year because of what you just described. Very different dynamics this year. I'd say one of the biggest issues is really the inflation cost on all materials here and then the pricing actions that we can take. So that's a pretty big dynamic for all of us that you see reporting here. But probably, the first quarter, the cost deflation was very little. It was about $20 million. We expect in the second quarter that lists to about $90 million. And we expect the full year impact of raw material inflation to be about $300 million. So it kind of goes up to kind of $90 million to $100 million second quarter, holds there for the year, which gets you kind of the $300 million. So we've been have -- been a constructive price market speed, and we think we'll catch most of the second quarter inflation, but maybe not all of it as we have some contracts that are 30, 60 days. But we're very confident that we'll be able to cover the walls if you look at the year in total, that we'll be able to make that up. So we're expecting for total DuPont for our pricing to be up low single digits for the year. But clearly, more so in the M&M division where a lot them of all inflation is -- no price increase in electronics, simply because you don't get it there, you get a new product introductions that you get fed and some price increase in water and protections -- within water and safety business specifically. So I'd say that's a big dynamic there. And then from a kind of a revenue standpoint, I'd say the other big dynamic is because of the raw material constraints that we're seeing. When we did the fourth quarter call, Lori and I talked about a $60 million to $80 million miss in sales that we were expecting in the quarter. And then you had the freeze down in Texas. So we think it's -- we missed out about $100 million of sales in the quarter, which is $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA. We expect another $100 million in the second quarter, $100 million to $120 million of missed revenue. But like you're hearing from all the others, we're not going to lose the business. We will make it up as the the constraints kind of worked their way through because everyone was kind of dealing with the same issue here. So I'd say that's the large dynamics of sequentially and then going into the second half of the year. [indiscernible] end markets, Steve played out the way we thought they would. The ones we thought would be hot were hot. The ones we thought we saw, like commercial construction, residential oil and gas are all living nicely on the lows of last year, but not back to '19 levels. So we expect that to continue through the year also."

But I think they understand it, it's very important to me and to DuPont that this goes well, we go off in more than half the company is what we put into IFF. So it's extremely important to our shareholder base. So I think it's morally the right thing to do. Under the definition by in an independent director, there's absolutely no doubt about that. And it's very similar driven on the Corteva Board, the help and the transition there. I don't see this is any different than I think it's [indiscernible] to do."

So I don't see a material change in the actual EBITDA number kind of similar to the revenue conversation we had earlier. So I think a similar environment. As I mentioned earlier, from an end market perspective, we're generally that and even above 2019 in those cases, the full year guidance that we get out there has our revenue up 6% versus 2019. And the guy that we put, I think, was the EBITDA kind of low teens. And so we're generally back and then the markets that are weak are really just a handful. And they're more around the aerospace which is up off the bottom, it off of 2019 and commercial construction, which the aggregates don't make up a material portion of our portfolio."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on the strong start that we had to 2021, including the advancement of a number of strategic priorities to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company, equipped for growth and value creation. 
But first, let me acknowledge the tremendous dedication and determination of our teams around the world as we continue to manage the extraordinary circumstances of this pandemic. The health and well-being of our people remains our top priority. The principles and protocols we've implemented globally and locally to help to protect our people and ensure business continuity as countries face multiple waves of infection and lockdowns. As an innovation-led company, we believe in science and we're encouraging all employees to get vaccinated. And where possible, we're working with public health authorities to facilitate access and distribution.  
Starting on Slide 2, I will note that one of our priorities for generating value is consistent operating performance and financial results. This morning, we announced strong top line and earnings results for the first quarter, both above our expectations. Lori will take you through the details in a moment. But I'd like to highlight the 7% organic revenue growth that we reported, reflecting broad and strong demand in key markets such as semiconductors, smartphones, water, residential construction and automotive. This revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline, led to strong operating leverage and EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Our first quarter financial results reflect the agility of our teams to navigate through a challenging environment while facing escalating raw material and logistics costs as well as global supply constraints of key raw materials, most notably in our M&M segment.  
With strong order trend continuing and confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details regarding this increase shortly.  
In addition to our financial results, we advanced a number of our strategic priorities during the quarter. First, as previously announced, we completed the merger of our Nutrition & Biosciences business with IFF, creating an industry-leading company in the food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. As you know, this transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders.  
As part of the transaction, we received $7.3 billion cash from IFF and retired slightly more than 197 million coupon shares, or about 27% of our outstanding shares at the time with no cash outlay. We strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by paying down our $3 billion term loan, and we will redeem $2 billion of our long-term debt later this month. As a reminder, our next debt maturity will not be due until the fourth quarter of 2023.  
In line with our balanced approach, we returned about $660 million of capital to shareholders during the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Under our existing share buyback program, we executed $500 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. As a reminder, we have about $500 million of repurchase authorization remaining under that program, which we intend to utilize by June 1 of this year.  
Earlier this quarter, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share buyback program, which expires on June 30, 2022. We plan to be opportunistic under the new program as we move throughout the year.  
With respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35% and 45%. And we intend to work with our Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow our earnings. 
In March, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion. When completed, a planned acquisition of Laird advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. The Laird business will complement our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I, and it will add critical capabilities and market-leading offerings in thermal management and electromagnetic shielding, which are essential to emerging electronic applications. Our E&I team, along with our customers, are excited for this opportunity.  
We recently received regulatory approval for the transaction in Germany and Brazil and cleared HSR in the U.S. last month. As previously indicated, we expect the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. Finally, we announced previously that we have signed definitive agreements to sell our Biomaterials, Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses. We anticipate receiving more than $900 million in gross proceeds from those divestitures, and we expect those transactions to close in the second half of this year.  
Before turning it over to Lori to go through the details of the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide some context regarding what we saw during the quarter in our key end markets that we serve. Combined, the electronics and automotive markets account for nearly half of our revenues. Electronics continues to perform very well, and auto is recovering nicely from its 2020 lows.  
Within electronics, demand continues to be broad-based as the ramp-up of advanced technology nodes and a need for more memory to servers and data centers has accelerated. The server market, which is a large consumer of semiconductor chips and circuit board chemistries, continues to show strength and is expected to remain robust as Internet network traffic continues to grow. Furthermore, the deployment of 5G infrastructure by leading telecom companies in preparation for the next generation of ultra-high-speed data transmission should help sustain demand for premium smartphones, which is further enhanced by our favorable content play.  
With respect to the automotive end market, demand is well above the lows of 2020 but not yet back to 2019 levels, which sold 22.9 million vehicles produced in the first quarter and nearly 90 million units for the year. The lack of stable supply of critical components, mainly semiconductors, impacted the ability of the auto OEMs to produce more vehicles and rebuild inventories during the quarter. Even where we participate in the value chain within M&M, I think it's important to note that our first quarter Engineering Polymers volumes were not materially affected by the chip shortages as our demand from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers was not lessened as a result of the chip shortage. However, our ability to supply customers was affected by supply constraints of key raw materials, predominantly in our nylon and polyester product lines. This supply situation is gradually improving while we anticipate several critical products will continue to constrain our production through the end of the second quarter.  
We expect that annual sales as a result of raw material constraints will be captured in the second half of the year. Additionally, we believe that the automotive market will remain strong for the balance of the year as OEMs look to meet robust demand as well as replenish global inventories, which are currently below historical averages.  
Moving on to the water and construction end markets. Collectively, these 2 markets account for approximately 20% of our total company sales. Versus first quarter of 2019, demand for advanced water filtration and purification has strengthened, driven by solid growth in Asia Pacific. Strength in residential and commercial water markets as well as industrial and desalination segments [ has shown growth ].  
For construction, North America residential and do-it-yourself markets are up versus first quarter 2019. And while demand within the commercial construction segment has improved from the lows experienced in 2020, it is not back to 2019 levels.  
Lastly, demand within our industrial end markets versus 2019 levels is mixed. Within the electrical infrastructure and Tyvek protective garment markets, demand is at or above 2019 levels. However, demand in end markets such as aerospace and oil and gas is still below 2019 levels, but it's improved since the lows of the second and third quarter of last year.  
Sequentially, our sales in the aero and oil and gas were up over 40%. Our diversified portfolio of products and technologies will serve us as the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic. We are continuing to invest at competitive levels in R&D and innovation to further solidify our strong market positions and maintain our position as the partner of choice for our customers in 2021 and beyond.  
With that, let me turn it over to Lori to walk through the details of our first quarter financial performance."

As Ed said earlier, I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of our employees throughout the pandemic and our team in navigating through supply chain a",1586,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me cover our first quarter financial results on Slide 4. As Ed said earlier, I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of our employees throughout the pandemic and our team in navigating through supply chain and logistics headwind this quarter to deliver the following results. Net sales of $4 billion were up 8% versus the first quarter of 2020, up 7% on an organic basis. Overall sales growth was driven by strong volume, up 7% versus first quarter of last year, with volume increases in all 3 reporting segments. Currency provided a 3% tailwind in the quarter led by the euro. Portfolio was a 2% headwind, primarily due to the sale of the trichlorosilane business last year.  
Sales were up in all 3 segments, with E&I, M&M and W&P reflecting organic growth of 14%, 8% and 1%, respectively. On a regional basis, organic sales were up 20% in Asia Pacific, our largest region from a sales perspective, with strong results in all 3 reporting segments. Partially offsetting gains in Asia Pacific were organic sales decline in the U.S. and Canada and EMEA of 4% and 2%, respectively. The declines in U.S. and Canada and EMEA were driven by softness for aramid fibers, specifically continued softness in aerospace and timing delays in defense as well as auto builds, which were down in these regions.  
I'll provide more color on our segment top line results on the next slide. From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.05 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.91 per share, up 15% and 90%, respectively. Volume gains as well as benefit from prior year cost initiatives and currency drove 160 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and 1.9x operating leverage. Incremental margins for the quarter were 46%. I will walk you through the EPS later call in a moment.  
Our total company gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, flat on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin improvement in E&I and M&M on higher volume and manufacturing productivity was offset by a margin decline in W&P, resulting from higher unit rates versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower production volumes of aramid fibers. Gross margin expanded about 280 basis points sequentially, with margin improvement in all 3 segments.  
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 33.5% and 420 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on strong volume growth and a onetime discrete gain related to an asset sale. Excluding the benefit of the asset sale, operating EBITDA margin would have been 31.7%, a year-over-year improvement of 240 basis points.  
M&M delivered operating EBITDA margins of 22.9% and 320 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on higher volumes and savings from productivity actions. In W&P, operating EBITDA was flat versus the year ago period as sales gains and cost productivity actions were offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily higher unit rates, driven by lower production of aramid fibers and increased supply chain costs.  
For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $378 million and $95 million, respectively. These amounts include 1 month of cash flow from our N&B business compared to 3 months of N&B cash burn in the prior year. In addition, cash flow and free cash flow conversion was negatively impacted by a working capital headwind of about $300 million, led by higher accounts receivable balances, which were up in line with sales. For the year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of greater than 90%.  
Slide 5 provides more details on the year-over-year changes in net sales. Leading the way for the quarter was E&I with 15% volume growth, which had a record quarter. Volume gains were led by double-digit growth on robust demand for semiconductors across Asia. High fabrication utilization rates, driven by demand for new technologies and advanced nodes, along with the ongoing shift in digital transformation drove strong top line growth. In addition, share gains from recent wins for CMP slurry and lithography materials improved results.  
In Interconnect Solutions, double-digit growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones partially resulting from timing shifts that select OEM demand shifted earlier in the year this year, along with broader printed circuit board market recovery. 
Within Industrial Solutions, double-digit volume gains in display materials due to new time launches more than offset continued weakness in aerospace. The end markets within W&P were generally consistent with our expectations. Sales gains were led by Water Solutions with double-digit volume growth, reflecting strong demand for our reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration technology, led by Asia. Shelter Solutions had low single-digit organic growth versus the year ago period, reflecting high single-digit organic growth in residential construction and retail channels for do-it-yourself application, offset partially by softness in commercial construction market.  
Within Safety Solutions, pricing gains, favorable currency and strengthening demand for aramid fibers in industrial and automotive end market was more than offset by continued weakness in aerospace and year-over-year volume declines for Tyvek. Lower Tyvek production volumes were a result of higher planned downtime in the quarter.  
Also contributing to strong first quarter top line growth was continued recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about [ 60% ] of our M&M segment from an end market perspective. The most recent estimate of 1Q global auto builds were about 20.3 million units towards the quarter, up approximately 14% versus the first quarter of last year. As a result, volume in our Performance Resins business was up over 20% versus the year ago period.  
Another bright spot in M&M was improved demand for microcircuit materials, which we aligned to the M&M segment earlier this year. These specialized materials, along with adhesive growth, helped drive over 20% organic growth in Advanced Solutions growth in the year ago period.  
Demand in our Engineering Polymers business was strong. However, global supply constraints for key raw materials resulted in low single-digit volume decline. Our teams are experienced in navigating trading challenges and have worked diligently with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate the impact incurred as a result. Additionally, we expect to recover volume lost in the quarter due to these disruptions and raw material constraints [ part of this unit ]. 
Turning to Slide 6. I mentioned that adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.91 was up 90% versus the prior year. The largest driver of our year-over-year growth was a significantly lower share count, mainly resulting from the N&B exchange offer. The lower share count provided a $0.16 benefit versus the prior year. Excluding the lower share count, adjusted EPS growth was still significant, up 56% versus the prior year. Higher segment earnings provided a $0.13 tailwind in the quarter versus the prior year, along with benefits this year with a lower base tax rate and reduced interest expense. 
Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.4% was lower than forecasted as a result of a few discrete tax benefits in the quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was significantly lower than last year, resulting from the absence of certain discrete tax headwinds incurred in the prior year. For the full year 2021, we now expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%, down slightly from the 21% to 23% that we previously estimated at the beginning of the year.  
Turning to Slide 7. I will provide some commentary on our balance sheet and cash position. I mentioned earlier that net working capital provided headwinds in free cash flow in the quarter. However, I would like to point out that net working capital productivity gains of about $600 million that we have made in the first quarter of last year, increasing net working capital for about $3.5 billion at March 2020 to $2.9 billion at March of 2021. Both of these were driving down past due receivables and inventory. From a debt perspective, we have stated that we are committed to maintaining our current strong investment-grade credit profile. We started the year with $15.6 billion in current debt. And as Ed mentioned, we paid down our $3 billion term loan in February, and we will pay down $2 billion of debt later this month.  
Moving on to cash. Our cash generated from operations last year put us in a strong cash position coming into this year, and that balance grew with a $7.3 billion special cash payment from the transaction with IFF. In addition, we expect to receive over $900 million in gross proceeds this year from the previously announced sale of the noncore businesses. Our current deployment plan for 2021 includes a balanced capital allocation approach. Along with our plan for internal investment this year, we plan to grow through targeted M&A in areas of secular growth and will fund the $2.3 billion planned acquisition of Laird Performance Materials with cash on hand.  
We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders. Along with our dividend policy, we completed $500 million of share repurchases in the first quarter at an average price of about $73 per share and will remain opportunistic with our remaining share repurchase authorization throughout the rest of the year.  
On a go-forward basis, our target run and maintain cash balance is about $1.5 billion. And from a leverage perspective, our net debt-to-EBITDA target remains at 2.75x.  
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed to talk about our financial outlook."

I'll start, and maybe Lori wants to jump in. If I may, I don't think our normal cyclicality plays out this year because of what you just described. Very different dynamics this year. I'd say one of the biggest issues is really the inflation cost on a",518,"Yes. I'll start, and maybe Lori wants to jump in. If I may, I don't think our normal cyclicality plays out this year because of what you just described. Very different dynamics this year. I'd say one of the biggest issues is really the inflation cost on all materials here and then the pricing actions that we can take. So that's a pretty big dynamic for all of us that you see reporting here. But probably, the first quarter, the cost deflation was very little. It was about $20 million. We expect in the second quarter that lists to about $90 million. And we expect the full year impact of raw material inflation to be about $300 million. So it kind of goes up to kind of $90 million to $100 million in the second quarter, holds there for the year, which gets you kind of the $300 million. 
So we've been -- have been a constructive price market, Steve, and we think we'll catch most of the second quarter inflation, but maybe not all of it as we have some contracts that are 30, 60 days. But we're very confident that we'll be able to cover the walls. When you look at the year in total, that we'll be able to make that up. So we're expecting for total DuPont for our pricing to be up low single digits for the year. But clearly, more so in the M&M division where a lot of the world inflation is -- no price increase in electronics simply because you don't get it there, you get a new product introductions that you get fed and some price increase in Water & Protection, within water and safety business specifically. So I'd say that's a big dynamic there. 
And then from a kind of a revenue standpoint, I'd say the other big dynamic is because of the raw material constraints that we're seeing. When we did the fourth quarter call, Lori and I talked about a $60 million to $80 million miss in sales that we were expecting in the quarter. And then you had the freeze down in Texas. So we think it's -- we missed out about $100 million of sales in the quarter, which is $20 million to $25 million of EBITDA. We expect another $100 million in the second quarter, $100 million to $120 million missed revenue. But like you're hearing from all the others, we're not going to lose the business. We will make it up as the constraints kind of worked their way through because everyone was kind of dealing with the same issue here. 
So I'd say that's the large dynamics of sequentially and then going into the year, second half of the year. All the end markets, Steve, played out the way we thought they would. The ones we thought would be hot were hot. The ones we thought we saw, like commercial construction, residential oil and gas are all lifting nicely on the lows of last year, but not back to '19 levels. So we expect that to continue through the year also."

I think there's some of that going on, but everyone's getting allocated product at this point in time. So it's not like they're able to build an inventory base. 
I'll use DuPont as an example. Our inventory well of about $100 million, and it's in mostly in our M&M business, and we couldn't get it up on the other walls to get the product out the door. So we did plan on -- we're not double ordering. We just couldn't get it out the door to have a finished good. So again, in the scheme of our numbers, that's not a big deal.

So I don't see a material change in the actual EBITDA number kind of similar to the revenue conversation we had earlier, so I think a similar environment. 
As I've mentioned earlier, from an end market perspective, we're generally that and even above 2019 in those cases, the full year guidance that we had out there has our revenue up 6% versus 2019. And the guide that we put, I think, was the EBITDA kind of low teens. And so we're generally back and then the markets that are weak are really just a handful.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on another overall strong quarter, including continued advancement of our strategic priorities as a premier multi-industrial company aimed at growth and creating value for our shareholders. But first, let me acknowledge the continued determination of our teams as we navigate through
[Audio Gap]
 with strong order trends continuing and confidence in our team's ability to continue to navigate through raw material and supply chain challenges, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details on our updated guidance shortly. In addition to our financial results, we continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation during the quarter. In May, we further delevered our balance sheet by redeeming $2 billion of bonds, thereby reducing our gross financial debt to $10.6 billion at the end of the quarter. 
Since the end of last year, we have paid down a total of $5 billion of debt and do not have another debt maturity until the fourth quarter of 2023, which further solidifies our sound liquidity position. We also returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends. During the second quarter, we purchased a total of $640 million in shares, which includes completion of our previous share repurchase program and the start of repurchases under our new authorization announced last quarter, which expires on June 30, 2022. 
Through the first 6 months of the year, we repurchased approximately $1.1 billion in shares and plan to be opportunistic with our remaining authorization as we move throughout the year. And in July, we repurchased an additional $125 million of shares. With respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we intend to work with the Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings. 
Before I close, I'm pleased to note that in late June, we closed on the previously announced divestiture of our Solamet business for approximately $190 million. And on July 1, we completed the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials utilizing cash on hand. The Laird acquisition advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. 
Joining us today is the President of our Global E&I segment, John Kim. I am excited to have John on the call today, and I'll now turn it over to him to provide further detail on how this acquisition complements our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I."

It's a pleasure to be on today's call and to share more information about the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. It's an exciting transaction for DuPont that significantly advances our position in the electronics industry and accelerates the transformation of our Interconnect Solutions business into a total solutions provider. We've been following Laird for several years and have admired their capabilities as a leading provider of electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions and are excited to have added their capabilities and history of growth to our portfolio. As a reminder, Lair delivered $465 million of revenue with approximately 30% EBITDA margin in 2020. And E&I and Laird are both recognized for innovation, quality and reliability and have strong relationships across the electronics industry. This combination brings together DuPont's premier applied material science expertise with Laird's industry-leading application engineering capabilities. It also adds more content on many of the devices that we're already in. We have already begun the process of integrating Laird into our existing Interconnect Solutions business, providing opportunities to further optimize business structure, functional support and our global site network. We expect $60 million in run rate cost synergies by the end of year 3 with approximately 60% realized in the first 18 months. We expect to achieve cost synergies through a mix of G&A, procurement and site consolidation initiatives. 
On the next slide, I'll share some of the key benefits of this transaction and describe how the combination enhances DuPont's position as a leading electronic materials provider. The acquisition of Laird expands our position as an essential partner of choice for major OEMs. Laird serves a broad set of overlapping and complementary end markets across consumer electronics, telecommunications, automotive and other industrials with a similar geographic representation to the rest of the Interconnect Solutions business with a particularly strong presence in Asia. The second way it enhances our position is through innovation. This acquisition strategically aligns us to critical needs across thermal management, signal integrity, power management, miniaturization and high reliability. And it enables us to have early engagement with OEMs in both system design and material specification, creating both greater product differentiation and higher margins. 
The next benefit of the acquisition is that it broadens our portfolio of solutions. With Laird's unique multifunctional capabilities, we will leverage an expanded customer base, broad product portfolio, global scale and deep technical expertise to increase speed to market, create new efficiencies in the development of integrated and multifunctional solutions and provide high-value next-generation products that will deliver additional growth in the next several years. We believe customers will see immediate benefits as the combined E&I organization engages across value chains to address the increasingly complex challenges in the industry. Our combined organization will advance our leadership to help customers accelerate solutions necessary for the adoption of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, 5G communications, smart and autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things. We will be well positioned to capture growth in these key secular growth areas. In addition, we expect revenue synergies from cross-selling into complementary accounts and channels, new and faster product development for multifunctional solutions and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEMs. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to provide details on our second quarter financial performance."

I'll cover our second quarter financial performance, beginning on Slide 5. Our results for the quarter reflect the diversity and strength of our portfolio and our team's continued ability to execute in the face of escalating raw material costs and global supply chain and logistics headwinds. Net sales of $4.1 billion were up 26% versus second quarter of 2020, up 23% on an organic basis. The organic sales growth resulted from a 20% increase in volume and a 3% increase in price. Currency provided a 4% tailwind in the quarter, which was slightly offset by a 1% headwind as a result of noncore business divestitures in the prior year. 
Overall sales growth was broad-based with double-digit growth on an organic basis and all through reporting segments and across all regions. The most notable increase versus the year ago period within our M&M segment, reflecting visible change in the global automotive market, versus the prior year and disciplined pricing actions. I will provide additional color on our segment top line results on the next slide. 
From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.06 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.06 per share, up 53% and about 240%, respectively, since the year ago period. The earnings improvement resulted from volume gains, most notably reflecting recovery ongoing in key end markets adversely impacted by the pandemic and the absence of approximately $150 million in charges associated with temporary idling certain facilities, partially offset by the absence of a $64 million gain associated with a joint venture that has since been divested. 
Strong operating EBITDA leverage drove operating EBITDA margin expansion of 460 basis points. Incremental margins for the quarter were about 43%. Given the unique nature of 2020 and the discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year, it's important to evaluate our year-over-year operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis. Specifically, operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up about 40% versus last year after excluding the impact of the $150 million in idle mills incurred in the prior year, with about 240 basis points of margin expansion and operating leverage of 1.5x. 
Similarly, I continue to track our growth versus 2019 given the significant impact that the pandemic had in key end markets last year. In comparing our current second quarter results to a more normalized performance before the pandemic, all reported sales in the quarter were up 6% second quarter of 2019 and up 10% versus 
[Audio Gap] 
same period for our core sales. Operating EBITDA [indiscernible] 190 basis points of expansion, driven by broad-based volume gains. M&M delivered significant operating EBITDA improvement, driven by an overall recovery in automotive markets and the absence of approximately $130 million in charges associated with temporarily idling polymer capacity in the year ago period. Operating EBITDA margin for the quarter was 23%, reflecting volume growth and net pricing gains resulting from actions taken ahead escalating raw material costs. 
In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 4% versus the year ago period. Operating EBITDA margin and leverage were adversely impacted primarily by 2 key drivers: first, given contractual commitments with customers, local selling price increases lagged the headwind from raw materials and supply chain cost escalation. We expect this to resolve in the second half as price increases start to kick in. Second, production volumes for Tyvek protective garments were at peak levels in the year ago period given the company's response to the pandemic. This enabled us to minimize manufacturing changeovers to other Tyvek grades resulting in an overall increase in production rates. As Tyvek output shifted from protective garments to multiple other applications, the resulting increase in expected changeovers in the current quarter decreased production rates, leading to lower volumes. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $440 million and $224 million, respectively. While these amounts have improved since the first quarter, cash flow and conversion are not where we need them to be. The headwinds we face are related to increased working capital levels and capital spending in excess of D&A as we advance critical capacity expansion projects. 
With respect to working capital, we saw an increase in inventories due to our efforts to create a more stable supply chain for our customers given the strong demand environment and numerous raw material and logistics constraints. In the second half of the year, we expect higher cash flow and converting rates as the global supply chain and logistics environment stabilizes. 
Slide 6 provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. Starting with E&I. Organic sales were up 17% on 17% volume growth with double-digit volume growth increases in all regions. Volume gains were led by mid-20s percent growth in Industrial Solutions, reflecting broad-based demand strength across most product lines, but most notably for OLED displays for new phones and television launches, medical silicones in health care and [indiscernible] within electronics. 
Interconnect Solutions also delivered organic growth over 20% and with high-teens volume growth. The volume growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones, partially resulting from timing shifts as select OEM demand shifted from the second half this year, along with some share gains for printed circuit board. 
Semiconductor Technologies continues to benefit from strong electronics demand and advancements in key growth areas such as 5G, high-performance computing and electric vehicles. During the quarter, new technology ramps in advanced nodes within logic and foundry and higher demand for memory in servers and data centers drove double-digit volume growth. 
Continued recovery of key end markets within W&P, drove organic growth of 11%, driven by volume increases. Sales gains were led by recovery in construction within Shelter Solutions reporting organic sales growth of more than 30%, which reflects continued strength in North American residential construction for products like styrofoam and Tyvek [indiscernible] and in retail channels for do-it-yourself applications. 
Commercial construction recorded higher sales in the quarter for Corian surfaces as global demand continues to improve. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were up high single digits, reflecting strong volume improvement for aramid fibers in industrial, oil and gas and automotive end markets. As previously noted, lower production volumes for Tyvek reduced overall safety volume. 
In Water Solutions, broad-based demand for water technologies remains strong. However, logistics challenges, primarily in our ultrafiltration business, impacted our ability to supply, resulting in a low single-digit decline versus the year ago period. We expect organic sales growth for the year for Water Solutions to be in the mid- to high-single digits. 
The most notable increase in top line improvement within our M&M segment, which had organic sales growth of over 50%. The improvement was driven by the continuing recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about 60% of the segment from an end market perspective and helped deliver strong volume growth across all 3 lines of business. 
Local pricing gains of 13% also contributed to organic sales growth, reflecting our actions taken to offset raw material costs and higher metals pricing in the Advanced Solutions business. Excluding metals pricing, local price was up about 8%. 
Within Engineering Polymers, global supply constraints of key raw materials continues to improve but are expected to remain tight through the end of the year. We continue to expect to recover lost volume related to these disruptions as the raw material constraints are alleviated. 
Turning to Slide 7. I mentioned earlier that adjusted EPS of $1.06 per share was up over 240% from $0.31 per share in the year ago period. Higher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit totaling over $0.40. This net benefit resulted mainly from higher volumes and the absence of idle mills recorded in the prior year, offset slightly by portfolio changes, which includes the absence of the gain recorded in the prior year in corporate. Also providing a significant benefit to adjusted EPS versus last year was an approximate $0.30 per share benefit due to a lower share count. Benefit from lower interest expense in the current quarter as a result of our recent delevering actions was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to last year. Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.8% was higher than the year ago period due to the absence of certain discrete gains benefiting the prior year rate. For full year 2021, we currently expect our base tax rate to be closer to the lower end of our expected range of 21% to 22%. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed."

Let me discuss our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the third quarter and full year 2021. We are raising our full year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Along with the underlying improvement that we are expecting compared to our previous estimates, our revised guide also reflects the acquisition of Laird and the divestiture of the Solamet business. In addition, this morning, we announced the change in how we will treat intangible amortization expense beginning in the third quarter for purposes of determining adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.5 billion and operating EBIT to be about $4.235 billion. Also, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $4.27 per share at the midpoint of the range provided, which reflects about $0.23 underlying raise to our original estimate, a $0.10 benefit from the portfolio changes and about $0.27 full year benefit related to the amortization reporting change. For the third quarter 2021, we expect net sales to be about $4.2 billion, operating EBITDA to be about $1.07 billion and adjusted EPS to be about $1.12 per share, all at the midpoints of the ranges provided. 
Before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to provide some highlights on our commitment to ESG and while we sustainably grow and operate our businesses for the long term. In June, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which reflects our first full year progress against the 2030 goals that we set in 2019. Our report highlights more than 50 examples of how our teams are addressing the environmental and social needs of our customers and communities. Some of the highlights from this report are reflected on Slide 9. 
ESG is fundamental to our core long-term strategy, which is why the Board of Directors and I made the decision to incorporate the progress on our sustainability goals into our incentive compensation program beginning this year. As an innovation leader, we believe our biggest lever to affect economic, environmental and social progress is through working directly with our customers. Today, our R&D investment is focused on the intersection of key market trends and the needs of sustainable development. One example of how we are doing this is in the area of addressing the global need for clean water. Our Water Solutions business recently launched its B-free technology. This pretreatment solution enables a significant improvement in the reliability of reverse osmosis desalination plants. 
Another example is within advanced mobility. The broad adoption of electric vehicles is fundamental in addressing climate change. Through leveraging our broad portfolio of expertise in battery assembly and thermal management for electric vehicles, our DuPont M&M collaborated team with General Motors to develop an advanced adhesive solution for use in electric vehicles. In June, as a result of our close collaboration, GM recognized the DuPont team with the GM Supplier of the Year Award. The power of customer partnerships to drive sustainability is a key element to our long-term growth strategy, and I am confident that we will continue to deliver these types of wins in the future. 
With that, let me turn it to Leland to open the Q&A."

Part of it, as you had mentioned, is just from -- with this year's improvement is just from the stronger volume, resulting with higher yield for our facilities and higher results. But we're also driving improvement in reliability, enabling some digital tools across the organization and higher throughput throughout our organization with the 1 exception, as we had mentioned, within our Tyvek operation. So we did see gross margin deceleration there, really just a result of the fact that last year we were able to run only Tyvek medical grades in order to meet the pandemic response in this year. As that demand waned, we returned to other grades of Tyvek, results in more changeovers and therefore, some yield volume hits. But overall, we're on track with our commitments to get closer to that 40% range here over the next couple of years."

We now estimate it to be $400 million of a headwind. Again, as Lori had mentioned though, we will get price. It won't tie quarter-to-quarter here, but we'll get price to cover that. And you can see, obviously, we got nice price in M&M this quarter. We'll start getting price in W&P next quarter. We think we'll see some -- a little bit more escalation in roles in a few areas in W&P, which will hold the margins back maybe a little more than we would want going into third quarter, but again, still solid about where we were in the second quarter.

I think you could probably use Delaware as a blueprint. There's some other states that have wrapped us into legal issues where we absolutely didn't do anything at all.

So you see the Tier 1 fabs who are investing up in aggregate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 2 or 3 years, some in the U.S., some in Asian markets, some in Europe to expand and build capacity. Most of that capacity is going to be built to accommodate leading edge, both in the logic foundry side as well as on the memory side. We see that as extremely favorable to our business dynamics. When you make those investments at leading-edge foundries, then that increases the number of -- it increases the manufacturing complexity as well as the purity of the materials, all of which plays into the sweet spot of what we're able to provide for our customers. And our portfolio was broad enough that we're really touching every step of the manufacturing process for the wafer. So the partnerships that we have with the OEMs are strong. We continue to work together on qualifying materials for all of those next-generation, leading-edge solutions. And as we start to see the wafer start to come online, we've already seen some benefit this year to new wafer capacity.

But I think over time, the consistency of our results will prove out that we're a premier multi-industrial company. It takes some time. We've had 1.5 years of very consistent results. I think one thing we proved, because I heard -- Lori and I heard this a lot, especially from people that follow multi-industry companies is how would DuPont react in a downturn. And when the pandemic hit, I think our decremental margins were literally not the best, but best-in-class with the top-tier companies. Our top line, at the worst dropped 10%, and our decrementals come right in there. So I think we proved as a lot of people thought chemical company, you just kind of do a comment, you think we're going to drop pretty significantly in a downturn, and we did not. So I think that was a big proof point that through the cycle, we can perform very well. And obviously, we're performing very well with great incremental margins now on the upside as the revenue comes back. But if you really look at the pieces of the company, there's very little what you would call direct chemical commodity exposure in the company anymore. I mean, John, sitting here next to me. Look at our electronics business, it's a steady mid- to high-single growing industry, should be pretty consistent along the way. So I think over time, we'll get the valuation.

On the pricing question, so the typically, the electronics segment in general, we'd be about minus 1% a year based on the cost down and performance expectations of our customers. And where we really are able to capture price is on the next-generation products, and they tend to be fairly fast-cycle launches of new technology. So we typically get price on new technology -- A.nd then that technology pricing will erode over time, constantly replaced with the next generation of products where we get price. So in general, we see price kind of in the down 0.5% to maybe 1.5%. Share pricing is relatively flat. So we're actually holding price pretty well in this environment.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide comments on another overall strong quarter, including continued advancement of our strategic priorities as a premier multi-industrial company aimed at growth and creating value for our shareholders. But first, let me acknowledge the continued determination of our teams as we navigate through unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic. 
As a result of the principles and protocols that we adopted over the last year, we continue to operate safely and productively on site and remotely. We have encouraged all employees to get vaccinated, and where possible, we are working with local governments to facilitate access, including on-site vaccinations at some locations. Our Wilmington- based office locations have fully reopened, and I have to say it is great to be back in the office with our teams.
Starting on Slide 2. In line with our philosophy that consistent operating performance is a key factor in creating shareholder value, I am pleased to note that this morning, we announced another strong quarter with financial  results above expectations. Lori will take you through the specifics but in summary, broad-based organic growth was driven by continued strength in our key end markets, including ongoing recovery in those most impacted by the pandemic. Despite a challenging production environment with escalating raw material costs and continuous supply chain and logistics constraints, strong operating discipline and quick pricing actions resulted in about 460 basis points of margin expansion versus the year-ago period. 
With strong order trends continuing and confidence in our teams' ability to continue to navigate through raw material and supply chain challenges, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. I will provide more details on our updated guidance shortly. 
In addition to our financial results, we continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation during the quarter. In May, we further delevered our balance sheet by redeeming $2 billion of bonds, thereby reducing our gross financial debt to $10.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Since the end of last year, we have paid down a total of $5 billion of debt and do not have another debt maturity until the fourth quarter of 2023, which further solidifies our sound liquidity position. 
We also returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends. During the second quarter, we purchased a total of $640 million in shares, which includes completion of our previous share repurchase program and the start of repurchases under our new authorization announced last quarter, which expires on June 30, 2022. Through the first 6 months of the year, we repurchased approximately $1.1 billion in shares and plan to be opportunistic with our remaining authorization as we move throughout the year. And in July, we repurchased an additional $125 million of shares. 
With respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we intend to work with the Board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings.  
Before I close, I'm pleased to note that in late June, we closed on the previously announced divestiture of our Solamet business for approximately $190 million. And on July 1, we completed the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials utilizing cash on hand. The Laird acquisition advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials.  
Joining us today is the President of our Global E&I segment, Jon Kemp. I am excited to have Jon on the call today, and I'll now turn it over to him to provide further detail on how this acquisition complements our Interconnect Solutions business within E&I."

It's a pleasure to be on today's call and to share more information about the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. 
It's an exciting transaction for DuPont that significantly advances our position in the electronics industry and accelerates the transformation of our Interconnect Solutions business into a total solutions provider. We've been following Laird for several years and have admired their capabilities as a leading provider of electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions and are excited to have added their capabilities and history of growth to our portfolio. As a reminder, Laird delivered $465 million of revenue with approximately 30% EBITDA margin in 2020. 
E&I and Laird are both recognized for innovation, quality and reliability and have strong relationships across the electronics industry. This combination brings together DuPont's premier applied material science expertise with Laird's industry-leading application engineering capabilities. It also adds more content on many of the devices that we're already in. 
We have already begun the process of integrating Laird into our existing Interconnect Solutions business, providing opportunities to further optimize business structure, functional support and our global site network. We expect $60 million in run rate cost synergies by the end of year 3 with approximately 60% realized in the first 18 months. We expect to achieve cost synergies through a mix of G&A, procurement and site consolidation initiatives.  
On the next slide, I'll share some of the key benefits of this transaction and describe how the combination enhances DuPont's position as a leading electronic materials provider. The acquisition of Laird expands our position as an essential partner of choice for major OEMs. Laird serves a broad set of overlapping and complementary end markets across consumer electronics, telecommunications, automotive and other industrials with a similar geographic representation to the rest of the Interconnect Solutions business with a particularly strong presence in Asia. 
The second way it enhances our position is through innovation. This acquisition strategically aligns us to critical needs across thermal management, signal integrity, power management, miniaturization and high reliability. And it enables us to have early engagement with OEMs in both system design and material specification, creating both greater product differentiation and higher margins. The next benefit of the acquisition is that it broadens our portfolio of solutions. With Laird's unique multifunctional capabilities, we will leverage an expanded customer base, broad product portfolio, global scale and deep technical expertise to increase speed to market, create new efficiencies in the development of integrated and multifunctional solutions and provide high-value next-generation products that will deliver additional growth in the next several years.  
We believe customers will see immediate benefits as the combined E&I organization engages across value chains to address the increasingly complex challenges in the industry. Our combined organization will advance our leadership to help customers accelerate solutions necessary for the adoption of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, 5G communications, smart and autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things. We will be well positioned to capture growth in these key secular growth areas. In addition, we expect revenue synergies from cross-selling into complementary accounts and channels, new and faster product development for multifunctional solutions and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEMs.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to provide details on our second quarter financial performance."

I'll cover our second quarter financial performance, beginning on Slide 5. Our results for the quarter reflect the diversity and strength of our portfolio and our teams' continued ability to execute in the face of escalating raw material costs and global supply chain and logistics headwinds. 
Net sales of $4.1 billion were up 26% versus second quarter of 2020, up 23% on an organic basis. The organic sales growth resulted from a 20% increase in volume and a 3% increase in price. Currency provided a 4% tailwind in the quarter, which was slightly offset by a 1% headwind as a result of noncore business divestitures in the prior year.  
Overall sales growth was broad-based with double-digit growth on an organic basis in all 3 reporting segments and across all regions. The most notable increase versus the year-ago period was in our M&M segment, reflecting the sizable change in the global automotive market versus the prior year and disciplined pricing actions. I will provide additional color on our segment top line results on the next slide.  
From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.06 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.06 per share, up 53% and about 240%, respectively, versus the year-ago period. The earnings improvement resulted from volume gains most notably reflecting ongoing recovery in key end markets adversely impacted by the pandemic and the absence of approximately $150 million in charges associated with temporary idling certain facilities, partially offset by the absence of a $64 million gain associated with a joint venture that has since been divested.  
Strong operating EBITDA leverage drove operating EBITDA margin expansion of 460 basis points. Incremental margins for the quarter were about 43%. Given the unique nature of 2020 and the discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year, it's important to evaluate our year-over-year operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis. Specifically, operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up about 40% versus last year after excluding the impact of the $150 million in idle mills incurred in the prior year, with about 240 basis points of margin expansion and operating leverage of 1.5x.  
Similarly, I continue to track our growth versus 2019 given the significant impact that the pandemic had in key end markets last year. In comparing our current second quarter results to a more normalized performance before the pandemic, all reported sales in the quarter were up 6% versus the second quarter of 2019 and up 10% versus that same period for our core sales. Operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up 15% versus second quarter of 2019 or 1.5x leverage. 
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 32%, with 190 basis points of expansion driven by broad-based volume gains. M&M delivered significant operating EBITDA improvement, driven by an overall recovery in automotive markets and the absence of approximately $130 million in charges associated with temporarily idling polymer capacity in the year-ago period. Operating EBITDA margin for the quarter was 23%, reflecting volume growth and net pricing gains resulting from actions taken ahead of escalating raw material costs.  
In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 4% versus the year-ago period. Operating EBITDA margin and leverage were adversely impacted primarily by 2 key drivers. First, given contractual commitments with customers, local selling price increases lagged the headwind from raw materials and supply chain cost escalation. We expect this to resolve in the second half as price increases start to kick in. 
Second, production volumes for Tyvek protective garments were at peak levels in the year-ago period given the company's response to the pandemic. This enabled us to minimize manufacturing changeovers to other Tyvek grades, resulting in an overall increase to production rates. As Tyvek output shifted from protective garments to multiple other applications, the resulting increase in expected changeovers in the current quarter decreased production rates, leading to lower volumes.  
For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $440 million and $224 million, respectively. While these amounts have improved since the first quarter, cash flow and conversion are not where we need them to be. The headwinds we faced are related to increased working capital levels and capital spending in excess of D&A as we advance critical capacity expansion projects. With respect to working capital, we saw an increase in inventories due to our efforts to create a more stable supply chain for our customers given the strong demand environment and numerous raw material and logistics constraints. In the second half of the year, we expect higher cash flow and conversion rate as the global supply chain and logistic environment stabilizes.  
Slide 6 provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. Starting with E&I. Organic sales were up 17% on 17% volume growth with double-digit volume growth increases in all regions. Volume gains were led by mid-20s percent growth in Industrial Solutions, reflecting broad-based demand strength across most product lines but most notably for OLED displays for new phones and television launches, medical silicones in health care and Kalrez seals within electronics.  
Interconnect Solutions also delivered organic growth over 20% with high-teens volume growth. The volume growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones, partially resulting from timing shifts as select OEM demand shifted from the second half this year, along with some share gains for printed circuit board.  
Semiconductor Technologies continues to benefit from strong electronics demand and advancements in key growth areas such as 5G, high-performance computing and electric vehicles. During the quarter, new technology ramps in advanced nodes within logic and foundry and higher demand for memory in servers and data centers drove double-digit volume growth.  
Continued recovery of key end markets within W&P drove organic growth of 11%, driven by volume increases. Sales gains were led by recovery in construction with Shelter Solutions reporting organic sales growth of more than 30%, which reflects continued strength in North American residential construction for products like Styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap and in retail channels for do-it-yourself applications. Commercial construction recorded higher sales in the quarter for Corian surfaces as global demand continues to improve. 
Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were up high single digits, reflecting strong volume improvement for aramid fibers in industrial, oil and gas and automotive end markets. As previously noted, lower production volumes for Tyvek reduced overall safety volume. In Water Solutions, broad-based demand for water technologies remained strong. However, logistics challenges primarily in our Ultrafiltration business impacted our ability to supply, resulting in a low single-digit volume decline versus the year-ago period. We expect organic sales growth for the year for Water Solutions to be in the mid- to high single digits.  
The most notable increase in top line improvement  was in our M&M segment, which had organic sales growth of over 50%. The improvement was driven by the continuing recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about 60% of the segment from an end market perspective and helped deliver strong volume growth across all 3 lines of business. Local pricing gains of 13% also contributed to organic sales growth, reflecting our actions taken to offset raw material costs and higher metals pricing in the Advanced Solutions business. Excluding metals pricing, local price was up about 8%.  
Within Engineering Polymers, global supply constraints of key raw materials continues to improve but are expected to remain tight through the end of the year. We continue to expect to recover lost volume related to these disruptions as the raw material constraints are alleviated.  
Turning to Slide 7. I mentioned earlier that adjusted EPS of $1.06 per share was up over 240% from $0.31 per share in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit totaling over $0.40. This net benefit resulted mainly from higher volumes and the absence of idle mills recorded in the prior year, offset slightly by portfolio changes, which includes the absence of the gain recorded in the prior year in corporate. Also providing a significant benefit to adjusted EPS versus last year was an approximate $0.30 per share benefit due to a lower share count.  
Benefit from lower interest expense in the current quarter as a result of our recent delevering actions was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to last year. Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.8% was higher than the year-ago period due to the absence of certain discrete gains benefiting the prior year rate. For full year 2021, we currently expect our base tax rate to be closer to the lower end of our expected range of 21% to 22%.  
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Ed."

Let me discuss our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the third quarter and full year 2021. We are raising our full year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Along with the underlying improvement that we are expecting compared to our previous estimates, our revised guide also reflects the acquisition of Laird and the divestiture of the Solamet business. In addition, this morning, we announced the change in how we will treat intangible amortization expense beginning in the third quarter for purposes of determining adjusted EPS. 
At the midpoint of the range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.5 billion and operating EBITDA to be about $4.235 billion. Also, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $4.27 per share at the midpoint of the range provided, which reflects about $0.23 underlying raise to our original estimate, a $0.10 benefit from the portfolio changes and about $0.27 full year benefit related to the amortization reporting change. For the third quarter 2021, we expect net sales to be about $4.2 billion, operating EBITDA to be about $1.07 billion and adjusted EPS to be about $1.12 per share, all at the midpoints of the ranges provided. 
Before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to provide some highlights on our commitment to ESG and what we are doing to sustainably grow and operate our businesses for the long term. In June, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which reflects our first full year progress against the 2030 goals that we set in 2019. Our report highlights more than 50 examples of how our teams are addressing the environmental and social needs of our customers and communities. Some of the highlights from this report are reflected on Slide 9.  
ESG is fundamental to our core long-term strategy, which is why the Board of Directors and I made the decision to incorporate the progress on our sustainability goals into our incentive compensation program beginning this year. As an innovation leader, we believe our biggest lever to affect economic, environmental and social progress is through working directly with our customers. Today, our R&D investment is focused on the intersection of key market trends and the needs of sustainable development. One example of how we are doing this is in the area of addressing the global need for clean water. Our Water Solutions business recently launched its B-Free technology. This pretreatment solution enables a significant improvement in the reliability of reverse osmosis desalination plants.  
Another example is within advanced mobility. The broad adoption of electric vehicles is fundamental in addressing climate change. Through leveraging our broad portfolio of expertise in battery assembly and thermal management for electric vehicles, our DuPont M&M collaborated team with General Motors to develop an advanced adhesive solution for use in electric vehicles. In June, as a result of our close collaboration, GM recognized the DuPont team with the GM Supplier of the Year award. The power of customer partnerships to drive sustainability is a key element to our long-term growth strategy, and I am confident that we will continue to deliver these types of wins in the future.  
With that, let me turn it to Leland to open the Q&A."

We've mentioned in the past that we see a few hundred basis points of improvement in gross margin, getting closer to that 40% range over the next few years. So we continue to execute against that commitment. 
Part of it, as you had mentioned, is just from -- with this year's improvement is just from the stronger volume, resulting with higher yield for our facilities and higher results. But we're also driving improvement in reliability, enabling some digital tools across the organization and higher throughput throughout our organization with the one exception, as we had mentioned, within our Tyvek operation. So we did see gross margin deceleration there really just a result of the fact that last year, we were able to run only Tyvek medical grades in order to be able to meet the pandemic response. And this year, as that demand waned, we returned to other grades of Tyvek, resulting in more changeovers and therefore, some yield and volume hits. But overall, we're on track with our commitments to get closer to that 40% range here over the next couple of years."

So in the first half of the year, we definitely saw some acceleration of orders from smartphone customers really as a result of a couple of factors.

And then you had a lot of folks just trying to secure supply reliability in the face of some of the raw materials and logistics challenges. So in general, we think smartphones are going to grow about 10% over the course of the year, not quite as steep as seasonal curve of maybe what we've seen in the last couple of years. So the curve has flattened, but general demand continues to be strong."

And probably on the raw side, we've taken in inventory. And in many cases, we're waiting for glass fibers to do our compounding and finish it, but we wanted the supply in-house just because of all the challenges out there in the supply chain. So we purposely have allowed that to build some. All the inventory, by the way, is good, and we'll ship that out.  
So our free cash flow conversion in the first half is not what we would normally run as a company obviously. We will clearly improve fairly significantly in the second half of the year.

And maybe you could just speak to any update to the broader PFAS settlement strategy you have and whether we should be anticipating further state-by-state settlements or -- particularly states where maybe you don't have manufacturing capabilities. I thought the idea was just to concentrate on where you did. But just broad update on what you're thinking."

So look, Delaware ended up costing us $12.5 million. And remember, Delaware was one of the ones, I would say, where we manufactured because our big plant is literally right across the Delaware River, and the State of Delaware actually owns and controls the Delaware River Basin in that area. So look, I think the good news is we have a really good agreement between the 3 companies, Chemours, Corteva and DuPont, so we're holding hands and working together really well. And I think the Delaware one was a great example of that. 
So we have a few other states where we did have manufacturing locations. Let me just say, obviously, we're in conversations. I think you could probably use Delaware as a blueprint. There's some other states that have wrapped us into legal issues where we absolutely didn't do anything at all. I would point out Vermont as one of them. We have nothing there, nothing even close to being there. 
So each one is a little bit of a different strategy, but we're very focused on trying to resolve more and more of those issues. And I think Delaware was a first step. You can kind of see what we're up to."

Most of them have generally resolved themselves with the exception of glass fiber, which goes into a significant amount of our polymers. And so we'll see how the glass fiber market continues to evolve. But as we see it right now, we don't see the full $200 million in the second half.

And when we think about the semiconductor market, clearly, really strong investment trends by all of the leading OEMs in multiple regions. So you see the Tier 1 fabs who are investing up, in aggregate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 2 or 3 years, some in the U.S., some in Asian markets, some in Europe, to expand and build capacity. Most of that capacity is going to be built to accommodate leading edge, both in the logic foundry side as well as on the memory side. 
We see that as extremely favorable to our business dynamics. When you make those investments at leading-edge foundries, then that increases the number of -- it increases the manufacturing complexity as well as the purity of the materials, all of which plays into the sweet spot of what we're able to provide for our customers. And our portfolio was broad enough that we're really touching every step of the manufacturing process for the wafer. 
So the partnerships that we have with the OEMs are strong. We continue to work together on qualifying materials for all of those next-generation, leading-edge solutions. And as we start to see the wafer starts come online, we've already seen some benefit this year from new wafer capacity. We'll continue to see wafer capacity ramp up over the next couple of years as some of those investments start to come online. And we're really well positioned to capitalize on those trends."

We're created a little more like a Dow or a Lyondell, obviously, at a higher multiple. But I think over time, the consistency of our results will prove out that we're a premier multi-industrial company. It takes some time. We've had 1.5 years of very consistent results. 
I think one thing we proved, because I heard -- Lori and I heard this a lot, especially from people that follow multi-industry companies, is how would DuPont react in a downturn. And when the pandemic hit, I think our decremental margins were literally not the best, but best in class with the top-tier companies. Our top line, in the worst, dropped 10%; and our decrementals, somewhere right in there. So I think we proved -- because a lot of people thought chemical company, you just kind of do a general comment. You think we're going to drop pretty significantly in a downturn and we did not. So I think that was a big proof point that through the cycle, we can perform very well. And obviously, we're performing very well with great incremental margins now on the upside as the revenue comes back. 
But if you really look at the pieces of the company, there's very little of what you would call direct chemical commodity exposure in the company anymore. Jon's sitting here next to me. Look at our electronics business. It's a steady mid- to high-single growing industry. It should be pretty consistent along the way. 
So I think over time, we'll get the valuation. I think where our multiple sits versus the better multi-industry companies, I think we got a lot of runway in front of us. So I think consistency going forward will prove the day."

When I talk about market share, obviously, each fab and each customer is different, and I want to stay away from customer-specific comments. But in general, our portfolio is weighted more towards the advanced nodes and probably a little bit more on the logic side versus the memory side, although we definitely participate broadly across both segments of the market. 
On the pricing question, so we typically -- the electronics segment in general, we'd be about minus 1% a year based on the cost down and performance expectations of our customers. And where we really are able to capture price is on the next-generation products, and they tend to be fairly fast-cycle launches of new technology. So we typically get price on new technology. And then that technology pricing will erode over time, constantly replaced with the next generation of products where we get price. 
So in general, we see price kind of in the down 0.5% to maybe 1.5%. This year, pricing is relatively flat. So we're actually holding price pretty well in this environment. And I think as Lori alluded to earlier, we'll continue to see positive price -- kind of flat to positive price for the rest of the year."

In addition to our excellent quarterly results, I am pleased [ we have ] the opportunity today to talk about 2 significant strategic news we are making to further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I will provide a brief overview of these announcements before Lori walks you through earnings, and then I'll be back to go into more depth on our announcements today. 
Our teams delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance ranges for sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS, highlighted by the actions we took to implement price increases to stay ahead of raw material inflation. 
In the quarter, we delivered a neutral price/cost impact for the company, which is a proof point in effectively managing the levers within our control to deliver strong results. Market demand in nearly every one of our end markets was strong, and our supply chain organization executed well in a challenging environment to deliver for our customers. Organic growth was up high single to double digits in every segment in the quarter. 
I am pleased by the quick actions our teams took to position us to continue managing the supply chain challenges and raw material cost pressures effectively as we head into the fourth quarter. As Lori will cover in a few minutes, we expect to fully offset raw material price headwinds again in the fourth quarter. 
As I mentioned, we also announced 2 strategic transactions this morning. The acquisition of Rogers Corporation and our intent to divest a substantial portion of our Mobility & Materials segment will significantly strengthen DuPont's position in our core high-growth, high-margin markets with a focus on electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. In addition to focusing the portfolio, strategic these actions will accelerate our top line growth, operating EBITDA margins and significantly improve our earnings stability. The combined transactions will allow us to benchmark extremely well against best-in-class multi-industrial peers, thereby resulting in long-term value creation. 
I will cover the details of the Rogers and M&M transactions in a moment but, first, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year."

As Ed mentioned, customer demand across almost all of our end markets remained strong in the third quarter. We saw continued improvement in many of the industrial end markets adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as global economies continued their recovery. 
Organic growth in the quarter was up 16% versus 2020. We delivered net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our third quarter guidance. In addition, we had strong cash flow generation and returned $657 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through $500 million in share repurchases and $157 million in dividends. We now have $875 million in share repurchases remaining under our existing authorization which expires next June, and we expect to complete the full year 2021 with about $2 billion in share repurchases, which is at the high end of the range that we provided earlier this year. 
Net sales of $4.3 billion were up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020, up 16% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 10% volume improvement and 6% pricing gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to offset inflationary pressure. Excluding the impact of metals, price was up about 5% during the quarter. A 1% portfolio tailwind reflects the net impact of strong top line results related to our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials and headwinds from the noncore divestitures. Currency provided a 1% tailwind in the quarter. 
Overall sales growth was broad-based and reflects high single to low double-digit volume growth in all 3 of our reporting segments. Double-digit organic growth within Asia Pacific, Europe and North America reflects continued strong demand in our key end markets. 
From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.09 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.15 per share, up 20% and about 90%, respectively, versus the year ago period. 
The earnings improvement was driven by strong volumes across all 3 reporting segments and earnings uplift from the Laird Performance Materials acquisition. 
The swift pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year in the face of raw material inflation continued to benefit our operating results. For the total company, our selling price increases during the quarter again offset raw material inflation. Gross margin was up about 160 basis points versus last year, reflecting increases in both M&M and E&I. Operating EBITDA margin of 25.5% was in line with our third quarter guidance expectations and reflects 50 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. Incremental margins were about 28% during the third quarter versus last year. However, if you exclude the impact of price and cost, our operating EBITDA margin for the quarter would have been nearly 27% and incremental margin would have been over 40%, reflecting very strong underlying operating performance. 
I have also mentioned previously that we track our operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis versus 2019 given the unique nature of 2020 and certain discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year. In comparing our third quarter results to pre-pandemic levels, sales for our core businesses were up 15% versus 2019, with operating EBITDA leverage at 1.4x on an underlying basis despite the global challenges around supply chain pressures and raw material inflation. 
From a segment earnings perspective, E&I delivered 13% operating EBITDA improvement on strong volume and better-than-expected results from Laird as we continue to integrate this business with our current electronics offering. The year-over-year comparison includes a headwind resulting from a technology sale in the prior year. Adjusting for this item, operating EBITDA was up about 20%, with margins essentially flat between both periods. 
In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 12% versus the year ago period on volume growth, primarily reflecting recovery in industrial end markets for aramid fibers and the absence of charges related to temporarily idle facility in the prior year. 
We were proactive in implementing pricing actions during the quarter in W&P. However, these actions were more than offset by raw material inflation and logistics costs, which resulted in headwinds to margins and operating leverage. We expect sequential price improvement as we continue to implement increases in response to raw material inflation. 
M&M delivered 75% improvement in operating EBITDA or about 2.5x operating leverage compared to the year ago period. The improvement reflects higher volumes across all end markets, net pricing gains in response to raw material inflation and the absence of charges related to temporarily idle facilities in the prior year. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $842 million and capital expenditures of $208 million resulted in free cash flow of $634 million. Free cash flow conversion of 112% was up significantly compared to the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 4, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. 
Strong customer demand across almost all of our end markets, including the continued recovery in many industrial end markets and the efforts of our supply chain organization drove organic sales growth of 16% during the third quarter. 
In E&I, volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment, led by double-digit volume gains in both Industrial Solutions and Semiconductor Technologies. The sales growth in Industrial Solutions reflects strong demand across all product lines, but most notably in [indiscernible] displays for new film and television [indiscernible], medical silicones in health care and [indiscernible] within electronics along with a continued recovery in aerospace. 
Semiconductor Technologies continues to benefit from robust demand driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced new technology and growth in electronic megatrends. We expect these strong demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales decline in the mid-single digits reflects the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium, next-generation smartphones to the first half of this year, along with softness in automotive end markets due to the semi chip shortage. We expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter. However, we do expect organic growth of ICS to be up mid-single digits on a full year basis. 
For W&P, 11% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of 9% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar aramid fibers within Safety Solutions, which was up double digits on an organic basis. 
For Shelter Solutions, continued recovery in commercial construction led by demand for [indiscernible] services contributed to high single-digit organic growth. In addition, we saw continued strength in North American residential construction market for products including Styrofoam and Tyvek [indiscernible] and the retail channel for do-it-yourself applications. 
Organic sales for Water Solutions were up low single digits during the quarter as global demand for clean water technology remained strong. However, logistics challenges do remain and have impacted our ability to meet demand. Pricing gains for W&P during the quarter reflect actions taken to mitigate raw material inflation, mainly within shelter and safety. 
M&M top line results reflect another strong quarter with organic sales growth of 28% on a 16% price increase and 12% volume improvement and included double-digit organic growth in each of Engineering Polymers, Performance Resins and Advanced Solutions. 
Throughout the year, our M&M segment has been the most significantly impacted by raw material inflation. As such, the 16% price increase reflects the continued actions we have been taking to offset these higher raw material costs and also reflects higher metals pricing in our Advanced Solutions business. Excluding the metals impact, price was up about 12% during the quarter. 
Looking ahead, while our global supply constraints of key raw materials have improved in M&M compared to earlier in the year and auto demand remained strong among consumers, we do expect softness in the fourth quarter as the global chip shortage continues. 
Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up about 90% from $0.61 per share in the year ago period. Higher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit to EPS of about $0.20 per share, driven by higher volumes and strong results from Laird. As I mentioned, we were price-cost neutral during the quarter given the pricing actions we have been taking to offset raw material inflation. Our lower share count continues to provide a benefit to adjusted EPS, specifically a $0.33 benefit for the third quarter. Benefits from lower interest expense in the current quarter from delevering actions earlier in the year was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to the last year. For full year 2021, we expect our base tax rate to be about 21%. 
Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our outlook and guidance for the full year 2021. We expect strong underlying demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in almost all of our end markets and have seen signs of these trends in the month of October. However, we are starting to see the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage impacts our downstream customers' ability to produce, which is creating some deceleration in order patterns, primarily in automotive end markets, where IHS [indiscernible] estimates for the second half have been cut by 17%. 
Due primarily to the softness attributable to the semiconductor chip shortage, we are lowering the midpoint and narrowing the range of our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS compared to our previous estimates. 
At the midpoint of the ranges provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.37 billion, down from the midpoint of our previous estimate of $16.5 billion. 
Similarly, we now expect operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS to be about $4.15 billion and $4.20 per share, respectively. 
This is not a demand or market share issue or our inability to continue to pass on prices or effectively manage our global supply chain. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have successfully executed on each of these. This is purely a result of the global semiconductor shortage which is impacting our customers' ability to produce and thereby pushing out demand. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Ed."

The announcement of an agreement to acquire",3443,"Thanks, Lori. I'm excited to share with you more detail on the 2 significant strategic news we announced this morning which will further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. The announcement of an agreement to acquire Rogers Corporation and our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment are substantial moves advancing our strategy to shift the portfolio towards higher-growth and higher-margin businesses while significantly enhancing the earnings stability of the company. 
The acquisition of Rogers will build on the Laird Performance Materials' acquisition that we closed July 1, adding another high-quality business that expands our leading market position across highly attractive end markets. 
Rogers is a market leader in each of their primary product categories and brings a world-class organization with differentiated technology, innovation capabilities, technical expertise and deep customer relationships, the same value proposition that differentiates our DuPont businesses. 
Rogers operates in end markets where we have already established leading positions, such as consumer and mobile electronics, and in others that are adjacent to our businesses, such as 5G infrastructure and electric vehicles, enabling us to offer an even more attractive total value proposition to a broader base of customers and creating the opportunity to compound growth over time given complementary products and markets. 
While M&M has been the market leader in high-performance thermoplastics serving automotive, electronics, industrial and consumer markets, we believe DuPont is no longer the best owner for this asset. By separating M&M from the rest of the portfolio, we are better positioning the business to expand on its leadership position in these markets and continue to tackle some of the industry's most critical challenges, such as vehicle safety and fuel efficiency. 
We will leverage existing tax attributes to complete a highly efficient cash sale of the M&M business, providing ample funding to finance the Rogers acquisition as well as further M&A and share repurchases while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. We have a few key targets, which like Laird and Rogers, we have been spending for a few years that would be excellent additions to our portfolio. 
Following the completion of the intended Rogers acquisition and the planned divestiture of M&M, DuPont will focus on key emerging technologies and have enhanced top line growth. Our participation in the auto markets going forward is much more connected to high-margin, advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends like hybrid and electric vehicles as well as advanced driver systems. A large portion of our order exposure will be aligned to EVs and ADAS, both of which are growing at a significant pace. This improved balance in our end markets will drive further consistency in our results and allow us to deliver best-in-class results among our multi-industrial peers. Strengthening our position in clean energy and electric vehicles, combined with our existing positions in water, safety and production technologies will continue to advance our customer sustainability priorities. 
Slide 8 shows the modeling we have done for the company, assuming the completion of both the M&M divestiture and the Rogers acquisition, including full achievement of the planned cost synergies. As you can see, pro forma DuPont will benchmark well above our top multi-industrial peers on both organic growth and EBITDA margin and in line with this high-performing peer set on cyclicality which we measure as peak to trough earnings volatility. 
Our historical sales growth for the new portfolio will improve by 40 basis points to 3.8%, which is nearly 2x the growth rate of the top peers. This growth is driven by our exposure to high-growth end markets. For example, the semiconductor materials market is expected to grow at 4% to 6% per year which is evidenced by the significant investments in new fabs we are seeing in all regions of the world. Our $2 billion Semiconductor Technologies business, which holds leading positions in materials for both wafer production and packaging is positioned to outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points. Likewise, our $1.4 billion water business operates in markets that are expected to grow high single digits driven by the global response to concerns such as water scarcity and circularity. 
The acquisition we are making also increases our exposures in high-growth markets such as EV, which is a market growing at 30% per year. Rogers' high-performance elastomers, specialty busbars and thermal substrates complement our existing materials such as gap fillers, adhesives and Nomex papers. 
In the new portfolio, the strength in these businesses will accelerate the performance. In 2020, our top line for the core business declined about 5%, which was a solid result compared to our top multi-industrial peers which were down about 8%. Our new portfolio would have declined less than 3% during the worst of the recession in recent years, a substantial differential versus the peer set. 
We have taken several actions to drive top quartile EBITDA margins at DuPont. The M&M and Rogers transactions will deliver an additional 140 basis points of margin improvement on a 2021 basis, putting us well above our top multi-industrial peers. The new portfolio is a collection of specialty businesses underpinned by innovation, customer relationships and manufacturing excellence, a combination that supports robust, sustainable margins. 
I'm also excited about the consistency these transactions will bring to our results. Strong ties to secular growth drivers will limit the earnings volatility of the company throughout the cycle. You can see the earnings volatility of the DuPont portfolio was significant from 2019 to 2020, primarily associated with the M&M segment. The same is true as we look back further where the cyclicality in the portfolio was driven by M&M. Looking forward, our portfolio have minimal exposure to commodity feedstocks and, as a result, our cyclicality will significantly improve by 700 basis points to be in line with the top tiers. 
In addition to comparing to our top multi-industrial peer set, we also looked at how the new portfolio will benchmark against the entire set of 24 multi-industrial companies. The results are the same: we will benchmark well above the median of the entire multi-industrial group on both gross and margin and in line on cyclicality. 
With a more clearly defined portfolio and by improving the top line growth, EBITDA margins and cyclicality of the company to be well above our peer set, I am confident the quality of our businesses will be recognized which will translate into a valuation comparable to top peers. 
Getting DuPont to this point has been a multiyear journey, with decisiveness aligned with our value creation levers of active portfolio management, a best-in-class operating model and disciplined capital allocation. 
Slide 9 shows the actions we have taken to transform the DuPont portfolio to a combination of world-class businesses centered in long-term, secular, high-growth areas. Our strategy is intentional and included strategic decisions to shift the company to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses with less cyclicality, while also pursuing acquisitions to strengthen our leadership position and innovation capabilities in the secular growth areas of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. 
Our portfolio transformation started with the identification of noncore businesses, where our innovation, technical expertise and close customer relationships no longer drove a competitive advantage within the DuPont portfolio. We have been successful at identifying great owners for a majority of these businesses and our work continues. 
We expect to close the sale of the Clean Tech business before the end of the year for around $510 million. 
Earlier this year, we finalized the separation of the N&B business and an RMT transaction with IFF, creating a powerhouse in the food, beverage, health and biosciences markets. Separation of N&B provided a lift to the top line growth and operating EBITDA margins at the DuPont portfolio as N&B was at the low end of the portfolio on both measures. This was an unmatched opportunity to advance the DuPont strategy, including the receipt of $7.3 billion in tax-free proceeds, which we redeployed to create shareholder value and position N&B and IFF for future success. 
Today's announcement of our intent to divest a significant portion of the M&M segment is the next step to advance our transformational strategy by increasing the resiliency and earnings stability of our portfolio. Throughout, we have carefully assessed acquisition targets which can strengthen our leadership positions in the secular areas of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. As I have said before, we are strategic in our approach and only pursue targets that can be justified financially and that operate in our existing markets to minimize integration and execution risks. We prefer acquisitions that provide a significant synergy opportunity, similar to what we saw with the water acquisitions we completed in late 2019, the Laird acquisition earlier this year and the intended acquisition of Rogers. We also only pursue targets where innovation and our technical capabilities set us apart, which is the case for both Laird and Rogers. 
Our transformation strategy has also been underpinned by operational improvements. We have made fundamental changes in the way DuPont is ran. We have the full P&L accountability into the businesses by moving oversight of manufacturing, operations and R&D under our business presidents. We spend approximately 4% of sales on R&D, and we no longer operate a central R&D function. Instead, we have empowered our businesses to allocate R&D dollars to the projects that are most critical to their growth and then hold them accountable for delivering results. The same is true for capital spending, the majority of which has been focused on capacity-constrained areas. 
Throughout our transformation, the strength of our balance sheet has been and remains a priority. Following the N&B separation, we delevered our balance sheet to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio and credit rating that provides us flexibility. 
We also continue to control our costs at both our manufacturing facilities as well as in our corporate functions. We have been prudent in taking cost out of our G&A line and today have a best-in-class cost structure. The work in our manufacturing facilities is ongoing through continuous productivity and asset reliability improvements using new digital tools, which is an integral part of our operating plants today. 
The combination of focusing the portfolio and operational improvements have been part of our strategy to unlock shareholder value and strengthen the company. The M&M and Rogers announcements are significant strategic steps in our transformation. 
I'll move to Slide 10 to provide more details on the Rogers agreement. Our modeling of Rogers is based on our 2022 estimated EBITDA of $270 million, which we are highly confident the business will achieve based on a thorough diligence process, including a detailed review of their projections and assumptions. 
The purchase price of about $5.2 billion represents a 19x EBITDA multiple based on 2022 estimates before synergies. The multiple is expected to be below 14x after cost synergies. We are highly confident in the synergy number of approximately $115 million and our ability to achieve most of the forecasted synergies by the end of 2023, within 18 months of closing. 
We expect Rogers to be accretive to top line growth, operating EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS upon closing. We expect sizable revenue synergies from the combination of E&I, Laird and Rogers. But consistent with how we justify old deals, we have not assumed any revenue synergies in our modeling. 
And we expect closing to take approximately 6 months, putting us in the second quarter of 2022 Because the Rogers transaction will close before we expect the M&M divestiture close, in funding the acquisition, we expect to prioritize prepayable debt which can be retired upon receipt of the M&A proceeds to return our leverage to more normal levels. 
Slide 11 provides more detail on the synergy opportunities. DuPont is in a unique position to extract value from this combination through the synergy opportunity that comes not only from having one of the largest electronic material businesses in the industry but also from the acquisition of Laird that we completed a few months ago. 
We looked across all 3 organizations to determine where there were synergy opportunities. As is the case in many of our transactions, where we combine businesses, we have complementary product offerings in similar segments. We expect significant synergies in procurement spend as well as G&A costs. Because Rogers is a public company, we will also realize savings associated with folding them into our structure. 
Our anticipated Rogers cost synergies of $115 million, combined with the cost synergies we anticipate from the Laird acquisition, total approximately 6% of the combined revenue of our Interconnect Solutions business, Laird and Rogers, which is a very achievable synergy target. As I mentioned, we expect to achieve most of these synergies with 18 months of closing. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll provide more detail on the business. Rogers Corporation is a $950 million business with broad end market exposure. We expect Rogers' top line to grow in the high single digits, accelerated by leading positions in the rapidly growing categories of electric vehicles and advanced driver systems. The benefits of the planned synergies will deliver uplift to the EBITDA margins across all 3 businesses. 
Rogers has 2 operating segments with leading positions in each. The first segment is Advanced Electronic Solutions, which includes the high-frequency circuit or laminates business and the power electronics business. Rogers' second segment is Elastomeric Material Solutions. The high-frequency circuit or laminates business complements our existing printed circuit board business within Interconnect Solutions. This is approximately a $300 million business that manufactures copper clad laminates for high-frequency circuits using ADAS radars, 4G/5G base stations and military communications. 
Also included in the Advanced Electronic Solutions segment is the Power Electronics business, which includes both ceramic substrates and specialty busbars for high-power conversion used in applications such as electric motors for trains, ships, automobiles and wind turbines. Specialty busbars are used instead of cable bar systems and high power conversion applications when highly stable and reliable power conversion is critical. This is about a $250 million business today but poised for significant growth with exposure to next-generation technologies, including battery applications for hybrid and electric vehicles. 
The second segment is the Elastomeric Materials Solutions segment, approximately a $400 million business which manufactures precision phones and silicon materials with high reliability and high purity for cushioning, sealing, impact protection and vibration management across the number of growing end markets. This segment also has high exposure to electric vehicles for battery applications. 
On Slide 13, you can see the significant offerings in the combined entity through the examples of the electric vehicle, 5G infrastructure, consumer electronics and clean energy. The increased opportunity in electric and autonomous vehicles from the combination of Laird and Rogers adds to DuPont's existing material offerings into the electric vehicle. 
In a segment that is growing 30% per year, this is a tremendous opportunity to increase our share of wallet with offerings such as gap fillers, adhesives and Nomex paper from DuPont; high-performance elastomers, specialty bus bars and thermal substrates from Rogers; and electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions from Laird. 
Likewise, Laird and Rogers expand our offering in consumer electronics, where DuPont is already a leading material supplier through all 3 businesses within the E&I segment: Semiconductor Technologies, Interconnect Solutions and Industrial Solutions. 
EMI shielding, thermal interface materials and multifunctional solutions from Laird as well as high-performance elastomers from Rogers will make us an even more complete material supplier to leading OEMs. The combined application engineering and design expertise will be unmatched in the industry. 
We are very excited about the technical skills that will transfer to DuPont through both of these acquisitions which will enable the businesses to continue working with customers to solve their most critical challenges using our combined portfolio of advanced technologies, a hallmark of all 3 companies. Customers in these industries demand this level of sophisticated innovation and partnership. 
You can see how the acquisition of Laird and Rogers supports our strategy to expand our presence in high-growth secular end markets and creates opportunity for compounding growth across related products and markets. 
Slide 14 shows the combination of the Laird acquisition and the Rogers acquisition is highly complementary and can expand our addressable markets within key electronics segments by 50%. The addition of Laird and Rogers provides an entry way into markets such as clean energy, wireless infrastructure and defense electronics, where we previously had little exposure but will now have distinct competitive advantages. We see further opportunities for growth by leveraging the DuPont technologies across these additional electronics markets. 
The timing could not be better to enter these markets. The world is making significant investments in 5G infrastructure, clean energy and hybrid and electric vehicles, to name a few. These investments are leading to rapid growth in these areas. Rogers has been making significant investments in these areas and has a rich pipeline of offerings that will support the next-generation technologies. The acquisition creates an exciting opportunity to capture this growth, which we think will be compounded by leverage of the combined E&I, Laird and Rogers platforms. 
Moving to the intended M&M divestiture on Slide 15. At DuPont, we have a proven history of adapting the best owner mindset for each of our businesses. We constantly scrutinize our portfolio to ensure fit with our business objectives and to create as much long-term value as possible for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
By announcing that we have initiated a process to divest the majority of our M&M segment, we are committing to do just that: finding the right owner for a tremendous asset. The business to be sold predominantly includes the Engineering Polymers and Performance Resins lines of business. Approximately $700 million of current year revenue, M&M segment is not included in the scope of the divestiture and includes the automotive, adhesives and multi-based businesses, which align nicely with our offering for EVs and industrial technologies. 
The portfolio to be divested is expected to generate revenue this year of about $4.2 billion and about $1 billion of EBITDA. M&M is an industry-leading combination of high-quality businesses with best-in-class technology and application development, deep customer relationships, brands and manufacturing excellence. The business is well positioned to capitalize on the continued transition to hybrid electric vehicles and other emerging megatrends. The business is also poised to outperform its peers through the cycle, with a lean G&A structure, efficient manufacturing processes and a reliable supply chain of key raw materials. 
We expect that the divestiture process will move quickly. In fact, we will launch a marketing process in the coming days. We have considered multiple deal structures as part of the strategic review. We believe a transaction that maximizes the net cash proceeds to DuPont will enable us to build on our core areas of strength, like the Laird Rogers transaction, and create significant value for our shareholders. I look forward to updating you as our process advances. 
I'll wrap up with a few comments on why I'm excited about their future at DuPont on Slide 16. With the completion of the Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture, DuPont will be building around our core foundational pillars, including electronics, water protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. Each of these areas is experiencing rapid growth as a result of significant secular tailwinds with long-term growth drivers. From high-frequency connectivity in the most advanced technologies to water scarcity in some of the most remote parts of the world, the technical demands of our customers are high and we have a unique, advanced technologies to partner with them to solve these global challenges. 
The actions we have already taken, along with those we announced today, enable us to strengthen our leadership position in each of the markets we serve. I am confident this will lead to significant opportunities for employees and unmatched solutions for our customers. 
We are also creating an opportunity for significant value creation for our shareholders. As I mentioned previously, the combined transaction enhanced our financial profile through higher growth, higher margins and significantly more stability. We will be positioned to outperform throughout the cycle. These are indicators of a strong, healthy and vibrant company, and I'm confident we will benchmark with the best of our multi-industrial peers. 
Our capital allocation will remain balanced, returning value to our shareholders through a consistent dividend, that we expect to grow with earnings and share repurchases. As well as a strong balance sheet have been and will continue to be priorities for DuPont. 
We will also continue to invest in our business to grow organically and support their growth through select and targeted M&A. 
With that, let me turn it to Pat to open to Q&A."

And one of the great things about the sale of this, it's really extremely tax efficient for us, which makes it very attractive. The tax leakage on this deal will be mid-single digits to high-single digits. So it's pretty incredible that we're able to accomplish that. So I'm highly confident it's going to sell. 
I would say -- and by the way, I would say, just [indiscernible] for your thinking that we close a deal like that around October of next year, by the way, I also am highly confident, which is kind of surprising, [ in everyone ] some of the parts of DuPont, M&M is by far the lowest multiple in the company, and yet we will sell it for more than the multiple that DuPont trade at today. 
I would also say, if you just benchmark DSM's coming to market, I think a lot of you guys and analysts have it going for at least 11x. Our asset is a way better asset, it's better on growth, it's better on margins. It's much more global, bigger.

So we're highly confident. We've been scoping this out for a long time. 
One of the nice things here, I guess I say nice, is it's a public company. So all those costs go away which are pretty significant obviously. And that just happens. Then a big chunk of it is G&A and functional costs, streamlining it into our structure. We get some procurement savings also. Then we've got some facility consolidations. We've got sales offices all overlapping each other globally, as an example. 
So we've scoped it out in a lot of detail. Obviously, we'll get more detail once we can sit down even more with the team. 
And I would also add, we had just closed on the Laird deal July 1, and we had announced $60 million of synergies with Laird. And the team is now at $63 million, and that's literally line by line, who's doing it? When are we getting it? What's the payback? So we have line of sight.

So that's pretty much how we modeled it out and said we'll probably see it here in the fourth quarter. And as you all know, consumer demand is there. Auto builds are supposed to be up 11% next year. So We should be in good shape in 2022. But I think we'll probably take a little bit of a hit here in the fourth quarter, and that's what we guided to. There's no softness anywhere else in the portfolio. As you can tell, every one of our subsegments is up nicely except for 1. Out of 9 segments, 8 of them were up nicely. And the only 1 that wasn't was related to the smartphone market, and we knew that, we already highlighted that to everybody because the demand came earlier in the year to tee up for the production of the phones. And we knew the second half of the year to be softer and it will be fine again next year. So demand is perfect everywhere else.

We're actively working it, I'm comfortable we're going to get there. And we'll clean that issue up for the company. So that's number one. 
Number two, spinning E&I out, you've really got to go through the analysis of what that trades for, and I agree, it would trade higher. But what will now DuPont trade at on a bigger EBITDA base with what we put together here and we're taking up our top line growth rate, we're taking up our EBITDA margins, we're taking out the cyclicality in the portfolio, there's no way that doesn't benchmark well against some of these premier companies that we've used. So if you get some multiple uplift in DuPont, it kind of negates the multiple uplift from E&I, which is a smaller EBITDA base. 
I'd also say I get asked a lot about, because I've done a fair amount of RMT stuff, I always get asked that there is no partner for E&I. It's the business, there's nothing that matches up in size, even pre the Laird deal, by the way, that makes sense. And it would be pieces of E&I, which would leave just a partial business in DuPont and take the rest of that out. 
And then by the way, the beauty here, again, remember, the tax leakage is literally mid-single digits to high single digits depending on what price we get for it. That's a rare situation to be in. So it makes a lot of sense for us to do M&M."

If you use just a -- if you pull out kind of 2 spec",385,"Yes. David, maybe I'll give you kind of 2 quick examples here. When you look at it, Rogers really adds complementary materials and components that really build on DuPont's position in the industry today. If you use just a -- if you pull out kind of 2 specific application areas, around 5G and applications and smartphones, wireless infrastructure, military, defense, electronics and automotive radar systems, DuPont's the leader in flexible laminates. And Laird has the EMI shielding and the thermal management solutions. Rogers is the market leader in rigid PCB substrates. And so with that enhanced offering, not only can you cross-sell customers and expand your share of wallet with a global customer base, but one of the things we're really excited about, and we're already starting to see this with the Laird integration process, by the way, is engaging with customers to co-design and help address some of their most challenging needs. 
To give you one specific example there. Everybody is trying to make electronic devices smaller. And one of the ways you get smaller is to use hybrid rigid flex construction on the circuit board. And now we've got a market-leading flex circuit business, a market-leading rigid business, and those complex hybrid rigid flex substrates become a lot easier to work with our customers and they're already asking for it. 
If you switch over to the electric vehicle space, we've got quite a bit of content in automotive electronics today. But we really didn't have a lot of exposure prior to Laird or Rogers into things like the automotive -- the ADAS systems or the battery. And Laird brought the EMI shielding with some of the absorbers, a great position in ADAS systems. Rogers built on that with their high-frequency laminates. And then what we're really excited about is the opportunity that they have with the specialty busbars and the specialty foam, performance foams, to really address some of the critical needs in the battery packs and power assembly, power electronics parts of the electric vehicles. 
So you put all that together with our adhesives business, with the rest of our automotive electronics and we'll really be a preferred partner with both the Tier 1 auto OEMs as well as the OEMs themselves to design the hybrid and electric vehicles in the future."

When you look at it, it's really kind of different based on the individual product lines and the different divisions of the business. When you look at the high-frequency laminates business, the primary competitors there are companies like [ Sahi Glass, AGC ], who did a couple of acquisitions in the last couple of years to build up their portfolio in that space. You've got some -- Panasonic is there. So primarily Japan-based competitors. And then you've got some local folks in China who are doing some of that as well, largely because of some of the geopolitical situation. All of that is kind of outside and we're kind of back in the rearview mirror now. And the company is really well positioned in continuing to grow that. 
On the ceramic bus bar, ceramic substrates and specialty bus bars, that's a pretty fragmented business. You've got companies out there like [ DNCA, Ferrotech ] [indiscernible] and multiple others. It's a fairly fragmented landscape. What differentiates this technology is really the quality of the ceramic thermal substrates and the synergy that's created with silicon carbide power modules, especially for electric vehicles. 
And so when you combine that with -- similarly with the specialty bus bars, it's going to replace things like the wire harness that's in a power system. As Ed alluded to in his prepared remarks, the quality there is really what allows the step-up in the growth acceleration really driven by electric vehicles. 
On the elastomer side, it's companies like Saint-Gobain who really -- Woodbridge, Niadanko are kind of a few names there. 
Across the board in each of these kind of 3 businesses, Rogers, it has a leading market share. They're among the leaders. They're winning in the market. They've got a great pipeline of opportunities especially on the automotive, the advanced mobility side, with EV and ADAS. They're working with all the power electronic OEMs. And a lot of those are, by the way, are E&I customers as well. So we'll have great relationships across the industry to be able to deliver some of those growth synergies and the upside. 
On a historical growth rate, they've kind of been growing mid-single digits. And with the step-up from automotive opportunities in electric vehicles, which are markets that are growing anywhere from mid-teens and ADAS systems to 30% to 30% on the EV side, they'll see a nice growth acceleration as those start to scale over the next few years."

And we're able to catch up a little bit last quarter with our customers in orders we couldn't ship in the first and second quarter. 
But we're looking right now at additional surcharges on freight because that has continued to go up, especially ocean freight and all that. So I don't think we'll probably go are going to do some here. We actually have a meeting in the next couple of days where we're going to do a surcharge instead of a price increase on the actual product itself.

And it's always to our existing end customers and it also expands some markets where we think we can leverage our products, as Jon said, into these other markets. 
So it's just -- it's a very high-quality asset. Again, we've watched it for years and seriously for 3 years. And the beauty about this, the 13.6x, we feel like they, with the funnel they have, they're on the cusp of some real secular growth areas that we're getting in on early with them. 
By the way, we feel like we did that with Laird and we were already seeing it in the performance of Laird. They're nicely outperforming what we said we have literally bought Laird now. If you just use the numbers they're running at this year, we bought Laird at 10x. I think when we announced it, we said it was 11x. And the performance we're going to end the year out of Laird has already brought that down to 10x. So -- and that, again, a very high-quality asset we got at a great price. We think we're right at that point with Rogers, with the secular growth areas on ADAS is growing 15%, EVs are growing 30%, just to name the auto industry, and Rogers is very well positioned there. And these things are just beginning to really ramp."

What we're -- what we're facing right now is really just the semiconductor shortage impacting the OEMs that are pushing lower demand back to us.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  
In addition to our excellent quarterly results, I am pleased by the opportunity today to talk about 2 significant strategic news we are making to further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I will provide a brief overview of these announcements before Lori walks you through earnings, and then I'll be back to go into more depth on our announcements today.  
Our teams delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance ranges for sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS, highlighted by the actions we took to implement price increases to stay ahead of raw material inflation.
In the quarter, we delivered a neutral price/cost impact for the company, which is a proof point in effectively managing the levers within our control to deliver strong results. Market demand in nearly every one of our end markets was strong, and our supply chain organization executed well in a challenging environment to deliver for our customers. Organic growth was up high single to double digits in every segment in the quarter.  
I am pleased by the quick actions our teams took to position us to continue managing the supply chain challenges and raw material cost pressures effectively as we head into the fourth quarter. As Lori will cover in a few minutes, we expect to fully offset raw material price headwinds again in the fourth quarter.
As I mentioned, we also announced 2 strategic transactions this morning, the acquisition of Rogers Corporation and our intent to divest a substantial portion of our Mobility & Materials segment, will significantly strengthen DuPont's position in our core high-growth, high-margin markets with a focus on electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive.
In addition to focusing the portfolio, these strategic actions will accelerate our top line growth, operating EBITDA margins and significantly improve our earnings stability. The combined transactions will allow us to benchmark extremely well against best-in-class multi-industrial peers, thereby resulting in long-term value creation.  
I will cover the details of the Rogers and M&M transactions in a moment, but, first, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year."

As Ed mentioned, customer demand across almost all of our end markets remained strong in the third quarter. We saw continued improvement in many of the industrial end markets adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as global economies continue their recovery.
Organic growth in the quarter was up 16% versus 2020. We delivered net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our third quarter guidance. In addition, we had strong cash flow generation and returned $657 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through $500 million in share repurchases and $157 million in dividends. We now have $875 million in share repurchases remaining under our existing authorization, which expires next June, and we expect to complete the full year 2021 with about $2 billion in share repurchases, which is at the high end of the range that we provided earlier this year.
Net sales of $4.3 billion were up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020, up 16% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 10% volume improvement and 6% pricing gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to offset inflationary pressure. Excluding the impact of metals, price was up about 5% during the quarter. A 1% portfolio tailwind reflects the net impact of strong top line results related to our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials and headwinds from the noncore divestitures. Currency provided a 1% tailwind in the quarter.
Overall sales growth was broad-based and reflects high single to low double-digit volume growth in all 3 of our reporting segments. Double-digit organic growth within Asia Pacific, Europe and North America reflects continued strong demand in our key end markets.
From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.09 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.15 per share, up 20% and about 90%, respectively, versus the year ago period. The earnings improvement was driven by strong volumes across all 3 reporting segments and earnings uplift from the Laird Performance Materials acquisition.
The swift pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year in the face of raw material inflation continued to benefit our operating results. For the total company, our selling price increases during the quarter again offset raw material inflation. Gross margin was up about 160 basis points versus last year, reflecting increases in both M&M and E&I. Operating EBITDA margin of 25.5% was in line with our third quarter guidance expectations and reflects 50 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. Incremental margins were about 28% during the third quarter versus last year. However, if you exclude the impact of price and cost, our operating EBITDA margin for the quarter would have been nearly 27% and incremental margin would have been over 40%, reflecting very strong underlying operating performance.
I have also mentioned previously that we track our operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis versus 2019 given the unique nature of 2020 and certain discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year. In comparing our third quarter results to pre-pandemic levels, sales for our core businesses were up 15% versus 2019, with operating EBITDA leverage at 1.4x on an underlying basis despite the global challenges around supply chain pressures and raw material inflation.
From a segment earnings perspective, E&I delivered 13% operating EBITDA improvement on strong volume and better-than-expected results from Laird as we continue to integrate this business with our current electronics offering. The year-over-year comparison includes a headwind resulting from a technology sale in the prior year. Adjusting for this item, operating EBITDA was up about 20%, with margins essentially flat between both periods.
In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 12% versus the year ago period on volume growth, primarily reflecting recovery in industrial end markets for aramid fibers and the absence of charges related to temporarily idle facilities in the prior year. We were proactive in implementing pricing actions during the quarter in W&P. However, these actions were more than offset by raw material inflation and logistics costs, which resulted in headwinds to margins and operating leverage. We expect sequential price improvement as we continue to implement increases in response to raw material inflation.
M&M delivered 75% improvement in operating EBITDA, or about 2.5x operating leverage compared to the year ago period. The improvement reflects higher volumes across all end markets, net pricing gains in response to raw material inflation and the absence of charges related to temporarily idle facilities in the prior year.
For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $842 million and capital expenditures of $208 million resulted in free cash flow of $634 million. Free cash flow conversion of 112% was up significantly compared to the second quarter.
Turning to Slide 4, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter. Strong customer demand across almost all of our end markets, including the continued recovery in many industrial end markets and the efforts of our supply chain organization drove organic sales growth of 16% during the third quarter. 
In E&I, volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment, led by double-digit volume gains in both Industrial Solutions and Semiconductors Technologies. The sales growth in Industrial Solutions reflects strong demand across all product lines, but most notably in OLED displays for new phone and television launches, medical silicones in health care and Kalrez seals within electronics, along with a continued recovery in aerospace.
Semiconductor Technologies continues to benefit from robust demand driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced new technology and growth in electronic megatrends, and we expect these strong demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter.  
Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales decline in the mid-single digits, reflects the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium, next-generation smartphones to the first half of this year, along with softness in automotive end markets due to the semi-chip shortage. We expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter; however, we do expect organic growth of ICS to be up mid-single digits on a full year basis.
For W&P, 11% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of 9% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar aramid fibers within Safety Solutions, which was up double digits on an organic basis.
For Shelter Solutions, continued recovery in commercial construction led by demand for Corian surfaces contribute to high single-digit organic growth. In addition, we saw continued strength in North American residential construction market for products including Styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap and the retail channel for do-it-yourself applications. 
Organic sales for Water Solutions were up low-single digits during the quarter as global demand for clean water technology remained strong. However, logistics challenges do remain and have impacted our ability to meet demand. Pricing gains for W&P during the quarter reflect actions taken to mitigate raw material inflation, mainly within shelter and safety.
M&M top line results reflect another strong quarter with organic sales growth of 28% on a 16% price increase and 12% volume improvement and included double-digit organic growth in each of Engineering Polymers, Performance Resins and Advanced Solutions. Throughout the year, our M&M segment has been the most significantly impacted by raw material inflation. As such, the 16% price increase reflects the continued actions we have been taking to offset these higher raw material costs and also reflects higher metals pricing in our Advanced Solutions business. Excluding the metals impact, price was up about 12% during the quarter.
Looking ahead, while our global supply constraints of key raw materials have improved in M&M compared to earlier in the year and auto demand remained strong among consumers, we do expect softness in the fourth quarter as the global chip shortage continues.
Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up about 90% from $0.61 per share in the year ago period. Higher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit to EPS of about $0.20 per share, driven by higher volumes and strong results from Laird. As I mentioned, we were price-cost neutral during the quarter given the pricing actions we have been taking to offset raw material inflation. Our lower share count continues to provide a benefit to adjusted EPS, specifically a $0.33 benefit for the third quarter. Benefits from lower interest expense in the current quarter from delevering actions earlier in the year was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to the last year. For full year 2021, we expect our base tax rate to be about 21%.  
Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our outlook and guidance for the full year 2021. We expect strong underlying demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in almost all of our end markets and have seen signs of these trends in the month of October. However, we are starting to see the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage impacts our downstream customers' ability to produce, which is creating some deceleration in order patterns, primarily in automotive end markets, where IHS [indiscernible] estimates for the second half have been cut by 17%.
Due primarily to the softness attributable to the semiconductor chip shortage, we are lowering the midpoint and narrowing the range of our full year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS compared to our previous estimates.  
At the midpoint of the ranges provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.37 billion, down from the midpoint of our previous estimate of $16.5 billion. Similarly, we now expect operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS to be about $4.15 billion and $4.20 per share, respectively.  
This is not a demand or market share issue or our inability to continue to pass on prices or effectively manage our global supply chain. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we have successfully executed on each of these. This is purely a result of the global semiconductor shortage, which is impacting our customers' ability to produce and thereby pushing out demand.
With that, let me turn it back over to Ed."

The announcement of an agreement to acquir",3440,"Thanks, Lori. I'm excited to share with you more detail on the 2 significant strategic news we announced this morning, which will further strengthen our portfolio and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. The announcement of an agreement to acquire Rogers Corporation and our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment are substantial moves, advancing our strategy to shift the portfolio towards higher-growth and higher-margin businesses, while significantly enhancing the earnings stability of the company.  
The acquisition of Rogers will build on the Laird Performance Materials' acquisition that we closed July 1, adding another high-quality business that expands our leading market position across highly attractive end markets. Rogers is a market leader in each of their primary product categories and brings a world-class organization with differentiated technology, innovation capabilities, technical expertise and deep customer relationships, the same value proposition that differentiates our DuPont businesses.
Rogers operates in end markets, where we have already established leading positions, such as consumer and mobile electronics, and in others that are adjacent to our businesses, such as 5G infrastructure and electric vehicles, enabling us to offer an even more attractive total value proposition to a broader base of customers and creating the opportunity to compound growth over time given complementary products and markets.  
While M&M has been the market leader in high-performance thermoplastics serving automotive, electronics, industrial and consumer markets, we believe DuPont is no longer the best owner for this asset. By separating M&M from the rest of the portfolio, we are better positioning the business to expand on its leadership position in these markets and continue to tackle some of the industry's most critical challenges, such as vehicle safety and fuel efficiency.
We will leverage existing tax attributes to complete a highly efficient cash sale of the M&M business, providing ample funding to finance the Rogers acquisition as well as further M&A and share repurchases while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. We have a few key targets, which like Laird and Rogers, we have been spending for a few years that would be excellent additions to our portfolio.  
Following the completion of the intended Rogers acquisition and the planned divestiture of M&M, DuPont will focus on key emerging technologies and have enhanced top line growth. Our participation in the auto markets going forward is much more connected to high-margin, advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends, like hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as advanced driver systems. A large portion of our order exposure will be aligned to EVs and ADAS, both of which are growing at a significant pace. This improved balance in our end markets will drive further consistency in our results and allow us to deliver best-in-class results among our multi-industrial peers, strengthening our position in clean energy and electric vehicles, combined with our existing positions in water, safety and protection technologies will continue to advance our customer sustainability priorities.  
Slide 8 shows the modeling we have done for the company, assuming the completion of both the M&M divestiture and the Rogers acquisition, including full achievement of the planned cost synergies. As you can see, pro forma DuPont will benchmark well above our top multi-industrial peers on both organic growth and EBITDA margin and in line with this high-performing peer set on cyclicality, which we measure as peak-to-trough earnings volatility.
Our historical sales growth for the new portfolio will improve by 40 basis points to 3.8%, which is nearly 2x the growth rate of the top peers. This growth is driven by our exposure to high-growth end markets. For example, the semiconductor materials market is expected to grow at 4% to 6% per year which is evidenced by the significant investments in new fabs we are seeing in all regions of the world. Our $2 billion Semiconductor Technologies business, which holds leading positions in materials for both wafer production and packaging is positioned to outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points. Likewise, our $1.4 billion Water business operates in markets that are expected to grow high-single digits driven by the global response to concerns, such as water scarcity and circularity.
The acquisition we are making also increases our exposures in high-growth markets, such as EV, which is a market growing at 30% per year. Rogers' high-performance elastomers, specialty busbars and thermal substrates complement our existing materials, such as gap fillers, adhesives and Nomex papers.
In the new portfolio, the strength in these businesses will accelerate the performance. In 2020, our top line for the core business declined about 5%, which was a solid result compared to our top multi-industrial peers, which were down about 8%. Our new portfolio would have declined less than 3% during the worst of the recession in recent years, a substantial differential versus the peer set.
We have taken several actions to drive top quartile EBITDA margins at DuPont. The M&M and Rogers transactions will deliver an additional 140 basis points of margin improvement on a 2021 basis, putting us well above our top multi-industrial peers. The new portfolio is a collection of specialty businesses underpinned by innovation, customer relationships and manufacturing excellence, a combination that supports robust, sustainable margins.
I'm also excited about the consistency these transactions will bring to our results. Strong ties to secular growth drivers will limit the earnings volatility of the company throughout the cycle. You can see the earnings volatility of the DuPont portfolio was significant from 2019 to 2020, primarily associated with the M&M segment. The same is true as we look back further where the cyclicality in the portfolio was driven by M&M. Looking forward, our portfolio have minimal exposure to commodity feedstocks and, as a result, our cyclicality will significantly improve by 700 basis points to be in line with the top tiers.
In addition to comparing to our top multi-industrial peer set, we also looked at how the new portfolio will benchmark against the entire set of 24 multi-industrial companies. The results are the same: we will benchmark well above the median of the entire multi-industrial group on both growth and margin and in line on cyclicality.  
With a more clearly defined portfolio and by improving the top line growth, EBITDA margins and cyclicality of the company to be well above our peer set, I am confident the quality of our businesses will be recognized, which will translate into a valuation comparable to top peers.  
Getting DuPont to this point has been a multiyear journey, with decisive moves  aligned with our value creation levers of active portfolio management, a best-in-class operating model and disciplined capital allocation.
Slide 9 shows the actions we have taken to transform the DuPont portfolio to a combination of world-class businesses centered in long-term, secular, high-growth areas. Our strategy is intentional and included strategic decisions to shift the company to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses with less cyclicality, while also pursuing acquisitions to strengthen our leadership position and innovation capabilities in the secular growth areas of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive.
Our portfolio transformation started with the identification of noncore businesses, where our innovation, technical expertise and close customer relationships no longer drove a competitive advantage within the DuPont portfolio. We have been successful at identifying great owners for a majority of these businesses and our work continues. We expect to close the sale of the Clean Tech business before the end of the year for around $510 million.  
Earlier this year, we finalized the separation of the N&B business and an RMT transaction with IFF, creating a powerhouse in the food, beverage, health and biosciences markets. Separation of N&B provided a lift to the top line growth and operating EBITDA margins at the DuPont portfolio as N&B was at the low end of the portfolio on both measures. This was an unmatched opportunity to advance the DuPont strategy, including the receipt of $7.3 billion in tax-free proceeds, which we redeployed to create shareholder value and position N&B and IFF for future success.  
Today's announcement of our intent to divest a significant portion of the M&M segment is the next step to advance our transformational strategy by increasing the resiliency and earnings stability of our portfolio. Throughout, we have carefully assessed acquisition targets, which can strengthen our leadership positions in the secular areas of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. As I have said before, we are strategic in our approach and only pursue targets that can be justified financially and that operate in our existing markets to minimize integration and execution risks. 
We prefer acquisitions that provide a significant synergy opportunity, similar to what we saw with the water acquisitions we completed in late 2019, the Laird acquisition earlier this year and the intended acquisition of Rogers. We also only pursue targets where innovation and our technical capabilities set us apart, which is the case for both Laird and Rogers.
Our transformation strategy has also been underpinned by operational improvements. We have made fundamental changes in the way DuPont is run. We have the full P&L accountability into the businesses by moving oversight of manufacturing, operations and R&D under our business presidents. We spend approximately 4% of sales on R&D, and we no longer operate a central R&D function. Instead, we have empowered our businesses to allocate R&D dollars to the projects that are most critical to their growth and then hold them accountable for delivering results. The same is true for capital spending, the majority of which has been focused on capacity-constrained areas.
Throughout our transformation, the strength of our balance sheet has been and remains a priority. Following the N&B separation, we delevered our balance sheet to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio and credit rating that provides us flexibility.  We also continue to control our costs at both our manufacturing facilities as well as in our corporate functions. We have been prudent at taking cost out of our G&A line and today have a best-in-class cost structure. The work in our manufacturing facilities is ongoing through continuous productivity and asset reliability improvements using new digital tools, which is an integral part of our operating plants today. The combination of focusing the portfolio and operational improvements have been part of our strategy to unlock shareholder value and strengthen the company. The M&M and Rogers announcements are significant strategic steps in our transformation.
I'll move to Slide 10 to provide more details on the Rogers agreement. Our modeling of Rogers is based on our 2022 estimated EBITDA of $270 million, which we are highly confident the business will achieve based on a thorough diligence process, including a detailed review of their projections and assumptions. The purchase price of about $5.2 billion represents a 19x EBITDA multiple based on 2022 estimates before synergies. The multiple is expected to be below 14x after cost synergies. We are highly confident in the synergy number of approximately $115 million and our ability to achieve most of the forecasted synergies by the end of 2023, within 18 months of closing.
We expect Rogers to be accretive to top line growth, operating EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS upon closing. We expect sizable revenue synergies from the combination of E&I, Laird and Rogers. But consistent with how we justify old deals, we have not assumed any revenue synergies in our modeling. And we expect closing to take approximately 6 months, putting us in the second quarter of 2022. Because the Rogers transaction will close before we expect the M&M divestiture close, in funding the acquisition, we expect to prioritize prepayable debt, which can be retired upon receipt of the M&M proceeds to return our leverage to more normal levels.
Slide 11 provides more detail on the synergy opportunities. DuPont is in a unique position to extract value from this combination due to the synergy opportunity that comes not only from having one of the largest electronic material businesses in the industry, but also from the acquisition of Laird that we completed a few months ago.  
We looked across all 3 organizations to determine where there were synergy opportunities. As is the case in many of our transactions, where we combine businesses, we have complementary product offerings in similar segments. We expect significant synergies in procurement spend as well as G&A costs. Because Rogers is a public company, we will also realize savings associated with folding them into our structure.  
Our anticipated Rogers cost synergies of $115 million, combined with the cost synergies we anticipate from the Laird acquisition, total approximately 6% of the combined revenue of our Interconnect Solutions business, Laird and Rogers, which is a very achievable synergy target. As I mentioned, we expect to achieve most of these synergies with 18 months of closing.  
Turning to Slide 12, I'll provide more detail on the business. Rogers Corporation is a $950 million business with broad end market exposure. We expect Rogers' top line to grow in the high single digits, accelerated by leading positions in the rapidly growing categories of electric vehicles and advanced driver systems. The benefits of the planned synergies will deliver uplift to the EBITDA margins across all 3 businesses.
Rogers has 2 operating segments with leading positions in each. The first segment is Advanced Electronic Solutions, which includes the high-frequency circuit board laminates business and the power electronics business. Rogers' second segment is Elastomeric Material Solutions. The high-frequency circuit board laminates business complements our existing printed circuit board business within Interconnect Solutions. This is approximately a $300 million business that manufactures copper-clad laminates for high-frequency circuits using ADAS radars, 4G/5G base stations and military communications.
Also included in the Advanced Electronic Solutions segment is the Power Electronics business, which includes both ceramic substrates and specialty busbars for high-power conversion used in applications, such as electric motors for trains, ships, automobiles and wind turbines. Specialty busbars are used instead of cable harness systems and high-power conversion applications when highly stable and reliable power conversion is critical. This is about a $250 million business today, but poised for significant growth with exposure to next-generation technologies, including battery applications for hybrid and electric vehicles.
The second segment is the Elastomeric Materials Solutions segment, approximately a $400 million business, which manufactures precision phones and silicon materials with high reliability and high purity for cushioning, sealing, impact protection and vibration management across the number of growing end markets. This segment also has high exposure to electric vehicles for battery applications.
On Slide 13, you can see the significant offerings in the combined entity through the examples of the electric vehicle, 5G infrastructure, consumer electronics and clean energy. The increased opportunity in electric and autonomous vehicles from the combination of Laird and Rogers adds to DuPont's existing material offerings into the electric vehicle. In a segment that is growing 30% per year, this is a tremendous opportunity to increase our share of wallet with offerings such as gap fillers, adhesives and Nomex paper from DuPont; high-performance elastomers, specialty busbars and thermal substrates from Rogers; and electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions from Laird.  
Likewise, Laird and Rogers expand our offering in consumer electronics, where DuPont is already a leading material supplier through all 3 businesses within the E&I segment: Semiconductor Technologies, Interconnect Solutions and Industrial Solutions. EMI shielding, thermal interface materials and multifunctional solutions from Laird as well as high-performance elastomers from Rogers will make us an even more complete material supplier to leading OEMs. The combined application engineering and design expertise will be unmatched in the industry.  
We are very excited about the technical skills that will transfer to DuPont through both of these acquisitions, which will enable the businesses to continue working with customers to solve their most critical challenges using our combined portfolio of advanced technologies, a hallmark of all 3 companies. Customers in these industries demand this level of sophisticated innovation and partnership. You can see how the acquisition of Laird and Rogers supports our strategy to expand our presence in high-growth secular end markets and creates opportunity for compounding growth across related products and markets.
Slide 14 shows the combination of the Laird acquisition and the Rogers acquisition is highly complementary and can expand our addressable markets within key electronics segments by 50%. The addition of Laird and Rogers provides an entry way into markets, such as clean energy, wireless infrastructure and defense electronics, where we previously had little exposure, but will now have distinct competitive advantages. We see further opportunities for growth by leveraging the DuPont technologies across these additional electronics markets.  
The timing could not be better to enter these markets. The world is making significant investments in 5G infrastructure, clean energy and hybrid and electric vehicles, to name a few. These investments are leading to rapid growth in these areas. Rogers has been making significant investments in these areas and has a rich pipeline of offerings that will support the next-generation technologies. The acquisition creates an exciting opportunity to capture this growth, which we think will be compounded by leverage of the combined E&I, Laird and Rogers platforms.  
Moving to the intended M&M divestiture, on Slide 15. At DuPont, we have a proven history of adapting the best owner mindset for each of our businesses. We constantly scrutinize our portfolio to ensure fit with our business objectives and to create as much long-term value as possible for our shareholders, customers and employees.
By announcing that we have initiated a process to divest the majority of our M&M segment, we are committing to do just that: finding the right owner for a tremendous asset. The business to be sold predominantly includes the Engineered Polymers and Performance Resins lines of business. Approximately $700 million of current year revenue, M&M segment is not included in the scope of the divestiture and includes the automotive, adhesives and multi-based businesses, which align nicely with our offering for EVs and industrial technologies.
The portfolio to be divested is expected to generate revenue this year of about $4.2 billion and about $1 billion of EBITDA. M&M is an industry-leading combination of high-quality businesses with best-in-class technology and application development, deep customer relationships, brands and manufacturing excellence. The business is well positioned to capitalize on the continued transition to hybrid electric vehicles and other emerging megatrends. The business is also poised to outperform its peers through the cycle, with a lean G&A structure, efficient manufacturing processes and a reliable supply chain of key raw materials.
We expect that the divestiture process will move quickly. In fact, we will launch a marketing process in the coming days. We have considered multiple deal structures as part of the strategic review. We believe a transaction that maximizes the net cash proceeds to DuPont will enable us to build on our core areas of strength, like the Laird and Rogers transaction, and create significant value for our shareholders. I look forward to updating you as our process advances.
I'll wrap up with a few comments on why I'm excited about their future at DuPont on Slide 16. With the completion of the Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture, DuPont will be building around our core foundational pillars, including electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. Each of these areas is experiencing rapid growth as a result of significant secular tailwinds with long-term growth drivers, from high-frequency connectivity in the most advanced technologies to water scarcity in some of the most remote parts of the world, the technical demands of our customers are high and we have a unique advanced technologies to partner with them to solve these global challenges.  
The actions we have already taken, along with those we announced today, enable us to strengthen our leadership position in each of the markets we serve. I am confident this will lead to significant opportunities for employees and unmatched solutions for our customers.  
We are also creating an opportunity for significant value creation for our shareholders. As I mentioned previously, the combined transaction enhanced our financial profile through higher growth, higher margins and significantly more stability. We will be positioned to outperform throughout the cycle. These are indicators of a strong, healthy and vibrant company, and I'm confident we will benchmark with the best of our multi-industrial peers. Our capital allocation will remain balanced, returning value to our shareholders through a consistent dividend, that we expect to grow with earnings and share repurchases, as well as a strong balance sheet have been and will continue to be priorities for DuPont.  We will also continue to invest in our business to grow organically and support their growth through select and targeted M&A.
With that, let me turn it to Pat to open the Q&A."

We're starting -- literally starting the process in the next few days. And one of the great things about the sale of this, it's really extremely tax efficient for us, which makes it very attractive. The tax leakage on this deal will be mid-single digits to high-single digits. So it's pretty incredible that we're able to accomplish that. So I'm highly confident it's going to sell.
I would say -- and by the way, I would say, just targeting for your thinking, that we close a deal like that around October of next year. By the way, I also am highly confident, which is kind of surprising, [indiscernible]  some of the parts of DuPont, M&M is by far the lowest multiple in the company, and yet we will sell it for more than the multiple that DuPont trades at today. I would also say, if you just benchmark DSM's coming to market, I think a lot of you guys and analysts have it going for at least 11x. Our asset is a way better asset. It's better on growth. It's better on margins. It's much more global, bigger. And so I don't -- I'm confident it will sell for even more than the current -- company literally currently trades at now."

So we're highly confident. We've been scoping this out for a long time. One of the nice things here, I guess I say nice, is it's a public company. So all those costs go away, which are pretty significant obviously, and that just happens. Then a big chunk of it is G&A and functional costs, streamlining it into our structure. We get some procurement savings also. And then we've got some facility consolidations. We've got sales offices all overlapping each other globally, as an example. 
So we've scoped it out in a lot of detail. Obviously, we'll get more detail once we can sit down even more with the team. And I would also add, we had just closed on the Laird deal July 1, and we had announced $60 million of synergies with Laird. And the team is now at $63 million, and that's literally line by line, who's doing it? When are we getting it? What's the payback? So we have line of sight. And hopefully, we're being conservative here on the combo at $115 million of synergies for Rogers."

So that's pretty much how we modeled it out and said we'll probably see it here in the fourth quarter. And as you all know, consumer demand is there. Auto builds are supposed to be up 11% next year. So we should be in good shape in 2022. 
But I think we'll probably take a little bit of a hit here in the fourth quarter, and that's what we guided to. There's no softness anywhere else in the portfolio. As you can tell, every one of our subsegments is up nicely except for 1 out of 9 segments, 8 of them were up nicely. And the only one that wasn't was related to the smartphone market, and we knew that, we already highlighted that to everybody because the demand came earlier in the year to tee up for the production of the phones. And we knew the second half of the year to be softer and it will be fine again next year. So demand is perfect everywhere else. By the way, our supply issues with force majeures have cleaned up substantially, so we're not dealing with that. We're really dealing with just the semi thing.

The one item outside of free cash flow that we will get in the fourth quarter, as Ed had mentioned, is the proceeds from the Clean Tech divestiture. So that should be about $470 million after tax. That will be incremental to the roughly $2 billion that I had previously mentioned for ending the year."

But I wouldn't expect that you would see us do anything before we are close to or around the time of getting those proceeds in the fall. 
By the way, the team is very capable. It's a separate team that's doing a lot of the work on the separation of M&M. And we can get a transaction place for M&M in the next 3- to kind of 5-month time frame to have a closed deal, but then we can't spin it until we do all the separation work, which is why I say October of 2022 to get all that, where the [indiscernible] are done, the separations are all done, the tax work is all done, where we can separate it.

We're actively working it, I'm comfortable we're going to get there. And we'll clean that issue up for the company. So that's number one. 
Number two, spinning E&I out, you've really got to go through the analysis of what that trades for, and I agree, it would trade higher. But what will now DuPont trade at on a bigger EBITDA base with what we put together here and we're taking up our top line growth rate, we're taking up our EBITDA margins, we're taking out the cyclicality in the portfolio, there's no way that doesn't benchmark well against some of these premier companies that we've used. So if you get some multiple uplift in DuPont, it kind of negates the multiple uplift from E&I, which is a smaller EBITDA base.
I'd also say I get asked a lot about, because I've done a fair amount of RMT stuff, I always get asked that there is no partner for E&I. It's the business. There's nothing that matches up in size, even pre the Laird deal, by the way, that makes sense. And it would be pieces of E&I, which would leave just a partial business in DuPont and take the rest of that out. And then by the way, the beauty here, again, remember, the tax leakage is literally mid-single digits to high single digits depending on what price we get for it. That's a rare situation to be in.

If you use just a -- if you pull out kind of 2 specific application areas, around 5G and applications and smartphones, wireless infrastructure, military, defense, electronics and automotive radar systems, DuPont's the leader in flexible laminates. And Laird has the EMI shielding and the thermal management solutions. Rogers is the market leader in rigid PCB substrates. And so with that enhanced offering, not only can you cross-sell customers and expand your share of wallet with a global customer base, but one of the things we're really excited about, and we're already starting to see this with the Laird integration process, by the way, is engaging with customers to co-design and help address some of their most challenging needs.
To give you one specific example there. Everybody is trying to make electronic devices smaller. And one of the ways you get smaller is to use hybrid rigid flex construction on the circuit board. And now we've got a market-leading flex circuit business, a market-leading rigid business, and those complex hybrid rigid flex substrates become a lot easier to work with our customers and they're already asking for it.
If you switch over to the electric vehicle space, we've got quite a bit of content in automotive electronics today. But we really didn't have a lot of exposure prior to Laird or Rogers into things like the automotive -- the ADAS systems or the battery. And Laird brought with the EMI shielding with some of the absorbers, a great position in ADAS systems. Rogers built on that with their high-frequency laminates. And then what we're really excited about is the opportunity that they have with the specialty busbars and the specialty foam, performance foams, to really address some of the critical needs in the battery packs and power assembly, power electronics parts of the electric vehicles.
So you put all that together with our adhesives business, with the rest of our automotive electronics and we'll really be a preferred partner with both the Tier 1 auto OEMs as well as the OEMs themselves to design the hybrid and electric vehicles in the future."

On the ceramic busbar, ceramic substrates and specialty busbars, that's a pretty fragmented business. You've got companies out there like [ DNCA, Ferrotec ] [indiscernible] and multiple others. It's a fairly fragmented landscape. What differentiates this technology is really the quality of the ceramic thermal substrates and the synergy that's created with silicon carbide power modules, especially for electric vehicles. And so when you combine that with -- similarly with the specialty busbars, it's going to replace things like the wire harness that's in a power system.

Across the board in each of these kind of 3 businesses, Rogers, it has a leading market share. They're among the leaders. They're winning in the market. They've got a great pipeline of opportunities, especially on the automotive, the advanced mobility side, with EV and ADAS. They're working with all the power electronic OEMs. And a lot of those are, by the way, are E&I customers as well. So we'll have great relationships across the industry to be able to deliver some of those growth synergies and the upside. On a historical growth rate, they've kind of been growing mid-single digits. And with the step-up from automotive opportunities in electric vehicles, which are markets that are growing anywhere from mid-teens and ADAS systems to 30% on the EV side, they'll see a nice growth acceleration as those start to scale over the next few years."

The logistics issues, I don't think are getting any better out there. I think global force majeures did get better, as we said. So the raw material supplies into M&M has substantially improved, which is great. And we're able to catch up a little bit last quarter with our customers in orders we couldn't ship in the first and second quarter. 
But we're looking right now at additional surcharges on freight because that has continued to go up, especially ocean freight and all that. So I don't think we'll probably are going to do some here. We actually have a meeting in the next couple of days where we're going to do a surcharge instead of a price increase on the actual product itself.

So it's just -- it's a very high-quality asset. Again, we've watched it for years and seriously for 3 years. And the beauty about this, the 13.6x, we feel like they, with the funnel they have, they're on the cusp of some real secular growth areas that we're getting in on early with them. 
By the way, we feel like we did that with Laird and we were already seeing it in the performance of Laird. They're nicely outperforming. What we said -- we have literally bought Laird now. If you just use the numbers they're running at this year, we bought Laird at 10x. I think when we announced it, we said it was 11x. And the performance we're going to end the year out of Laird has already brought that down to 10x. So -- and that, again, a very high-quality asset we got at a great price.

We've obviously studied the antitrust extremely deeply, so I don't see any issues there. Could that close a little bit sooner? It could. But we're just targeting the second quarter to be safe. Could be a little faster. I don't think M&M will be faster than October 1 because the long pole in the tent is more of the work we have to do internally at DuPont to separate it. So we'll announce a sale to somebody way sooner than October 1, but we won't be able to actually separate it out of the company until that point in time."

And as a follow-up, you've clearly been on a path to move towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses in the hopes of getting some multiple uplift. What can you do to accelerate that if that's not shown in the market? Will you continue to march down this path of separation and streamlining? Is there -- it looks like there's more announcements coming potentially in Water. Is that the next area of growth that we should think about?"

We [indiscernible] decide that. We'd love that in our Water space. We'd love it in 5 single digit growth rate, I think, in the sector along for many, many years. And it's a global issue, which we helps solve for people. So we do like that space. Look, let's see how this year goes. I'm highly confident people will recognize what's in this portfolio. 
I will also add, I think, which would be very helpful for everybody, we started doing the teach-in, Jon did one on semiconductor a month or so ago. We have one coming up here shortly And we're going to walk you through every key piece of the portfolio. And I think it will really highlight the value. 
But internally here, like I just -- I'll use 2 companies we have, Vespel and Kalrez,  and I don't think anyone has a clue what those businesses are like and how awesome they are and how good and the growth trends in those businesses. So just to name 2 that we didn't even talk about today. So I think the teach-ins will be very, very powerful in people to see what we have and the value and the technology that we have in the company. And I think that's going to be helpful also."
