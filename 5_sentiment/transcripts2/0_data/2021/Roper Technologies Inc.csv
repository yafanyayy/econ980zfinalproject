Thanks for joining us, and we hope everyone is doing well. For today's agenda, we'll walk through our 2020 financials and operational highlights, then we'll turn to our 2020 segment detailed results and discuss our '21 segment-by-segment outlook and end with our '21 enterprise guidance prior to discussing your questions. 
Next slide, please. As we look back on 2020, it was quite a year. Our businesses performed at a very high level during this period. Revenues grew 3% with organic revenue declining a single percent. EBITDA also grew 3%, and free cash flow grew 16%. This cash flow performance, $1.7 billion, is just astounding. This is a testament to many things, notably our asset-light business model, the intimacy we have with our customers and the high level of skill and execution of our field teams. This cash flow is just simply a great result. 
Perhaps more important, 2020 was a year of forward progress for our company. We exit 2020 as a better company, a company with higher-quality revenue streams, a company with improved future innovation prospects and a company with whose portfolio was enhanced with $6 billion of capital deployment. To this end, we saw our software recurring revenues increase mid-single digits in 2020 and were benefited by high levels of retention and an acceleration to the cloud. 
We continue to be benefited by having close intimate relationships with our customers. Most often, our software is mission-critical to our customers' operations. In addition, we continue to strategically invest throughout our portfolio during the year. Based on our historical experience, we find times of market disruption the best time to double down on innovation and market investments, which, in turn, will drive market share gains in the years to come. 
Finally, we were able to deploy $6 billion to further enhance Roper's group of companies' headlines by our Vertafore acquisition. So when we look back on 2020, we highlight 2 key themes. First, we grew. Cash flow increased 16% in the middle of a pandemic. And second, the quality of our enterprise continued to improve during the year. Net-net, we got bigger and better during 2020. 
Let's turn to the next slide. Over the past 5 years, we highlight that our revenue grew at a 9% compounded rate, EBITDA at 10% and cash flow of 13%. We continue to grow and compound through macroeconomic cycles. Also, during the time period, the quality of our enterprise meaningfully improved. We are more software focused with nearly 2/3 of our EBITDA coming from software with higher levels of recurring revenue. Conversely, we are much less tied to cyclical end markets today, a little over 15% of our portfolio. 
Given our long-term strategy and these factors, we are a low-risk enterprise. We compound cash flow through cycle and do so with multiple growth drivers across both organic and inorganic fronts. As we look to '21, we will continue our long-term string of revenue and EBITDA and cash flow compounding. 
So with that, let's turn to the next page and discuss the macro backdrop for '21. As we look to 2021, we are set up for a strong year. We expect revenue and EBITDA will grow well into the double digits, likely in the mid-teens range with organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit plus range. This is on top of growth in 2020. The compounding continues. 
Breaking it down. Our software businesses, both in our application software and network segments are well positioned heading into '21. These businesses enter the year with momentum from strong retention and recurring revenue gains. They'll be further aided by growth in perpetual license as pipeline and customer activity are anticipated to recover to some extent. Our non-Verathon Medical product businesses are expected to return to a more normalized pattern of customer activity as health care facilities loosen restrictions. But since 2020 was while below trend, we expect above-trend growth here. Of note, Verathon has a challenging comp. However, the reoccurring revenue base will remain strong given the large volume of capital placements in 2020 and continued growth of their new single-use bronchoscope business. 
We expect Neptune to recover and grow nicely as our customers, especially in the Northeast U.S. and Canada, gain access to residential locations. We expect our industrial and process tech businesses to continue their quarterly improvements and return to growth after 2 years of macro headwinds. Finally, 2021 will be meaningfully aided by the contribution from our 2020 cohort of acquisitions. To this end, we continue to work with a very full and high-quality M&A pipeline. We are committed to deleveraging, but we also remain active in building and maturing our pipe. 
So as I think back over the nearly 10 years I've been with Roper, I cannot think of a better set of tailwinds heading into a year. Clearly, lots to do and lots of execution in front of us, but we have a strong momentum heading into '21. So now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob?"
22751,700847371,2185724,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone.

Total revenue increased 8% as we eclipsed $1.5 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 2% versus prior year. EBITDA grew 7% in the quarter to a record $552 million. EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points versus prior year at 36.6%. Tax rate came in at 19.9%, a little lower than last year's 21.6%. So all in, this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.56, which is above our guidance range. 
Next slide. Turning to Page 9, reviewing the Q4 results by segment. Neil will discuss the full year 2020 segment performance in more detail later, so just touching on some of the Q4 highlights here by segment. Application software grew 35% with the addition of Vertafore. Organic for the segment was minus 2% with mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth continuing. Sharp declines in our seaboard and horizon businesses, serving K-12 and higher education, impacted the segment as many schools unfortunately remain closed. For network software systems, plus 2% organic growth with our software businesses, putting up a very solid plus 4% organic. The transcore was flat versus prior year. For measurement and analytical solutions, plus 1% organic growth as we start to see some sequential recovery in Neptune in our industrial businesses. Segment margins were impacted a bit by the acceleration of some product and channel investments like Verathon, as we discussed, coming into the quarter, and it's really been an exceptional year for Verathon overall. 
Lastly, for Process Technologies, a 21% organic decline, with margins holding up well at 31.3%. And once again here, we started to see some early signs of improvement after a couple of years of declineds. 
Next slide. So turning to Page 10, looking at net working capital, only applied mostly speaks for itself, ending the quarter with negative 8% net working capital as a percentage of Q4 annualized revenue. While there are certainly some seasonal trends, primarily around timing of software renewals, they do typically benefit our Q4 performance. You can see there a meaningful improvement versus 2018, improving from negative 3.4% to negative 8% in 2020. Our asset-light negative net working capital model drives our sustainable, high cash conversion and fuels our cash flow compounding. Our people focus on what we all believe matters and our culture is built around growing the right way. Top line growth converts to cash flow, and we are always mindful of impacts to our balance sheet. 
Next slide. So turning to cash flow. Cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned, was really pretty spectacular matter how you look at it. Q4 free cash flow of $558 million was 23% higher than last year and represented 37% of revenue. This excellent result was driven by the great working capital performance I just discussed, which is really across the enterprise, along with meaningful cash contributions from Vertafore and the other recent acquisitions. So for the full year 2020, we generated $1.72 billion of operating cash flow and $1.67 billion of free cash flow. So to repeat, that's $1.7 billion of free cash flow in 2020, truly a great year. 
Full year free cash flow growth was 16%, and our free cash flow conversion from EBITDA was a robust 84%. So really tremendous cash flow performance, and it was broad-based and very durable. 
Next slide. So turning to Page 12, updating on our balance sheet. As Neil mentioned earlier, we ended the year with total capital deployment of approximately $6 billion, which included the EPSi acquisition that closed during the fourth quarter on October 15. We were able to take advantage of attractive market conditions to complete and opportunistically fund these acquisitions with a combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from our 2019 Gatan divestiture and investment-grade leverage. Overall cost of financing was approximately 1%. 
Thanks to our excellent Q4 cash performance, we're off to a great start on our plan to quickly reduce leverage, paying down to around $500 million since we closed the EPSi deal. Looking ahead, we plan to rapidly reduce leverage throughout 2021, taking advantage of our prepayable revolver, which has a current balance of approximately $1.6 billion. Our solid investment-grade balance sheet supports long-term cash flow compounding, which we are well positioned to continue. 
So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks."

To help orient you to this page, we're comparing a full year outlook from last April to that of what actually happened. It's worth reminding everyone that we felt our businesses and our business model had the level of recurring revenue, customer intimacy and the business leadership required to guide in the face of the COVID uncertainty, both in terms of supply and demand. In aggregate, we thought our full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat, and we came in at down minus 1%. The TransCore New York project is the primary reconciling item between being down a touch and being flat or slightly up. And more on this in a minute. We guided depths to be between 11 60 and 12 60 and came in at 12 74. Looking back on this, we are very proud of our team's ability to look forward and operate through the uncertainty of last year. Also, there is no better example of the durability of our model than this past year. 
With that, let's walk through the macro drivers across each of our 4 segments. Relative to Application Software, this segment played out as anticipated and was up 1% on an organic basis for the year. Specifically, we saw recurring revenue up mid-single digits, aided by very strong retention rates as well as an acceleration to the cloud. As a reminder, recurring revenue in this segment is about 70% of our revenue stream. 
Perpetual revenues, about 10% of this segment's revenue, were under pressure as expected. We saw this revenue stream down mid-teens as new logo opportunities and wins were pushed and delayed. That said, cross-selling activity remained active for much of 2020. Relative to services revenue, we anticipated some pressure tied to shifting to remote installs and having fewer new implementations, which are tied to new perpetual transactions. For 2020, we saw mid-single-digit declines here, principally tied to fewer new deals. Our teams did a wonderful job shifting to remote installs, a trend we anticipate will continue in large part on the backside of the pandemic. 
As it relates to our Network segment, we expect the organic revenue for the year to be up mid-singles to double digits when, in fact, we grew 3% for the full year. Our Network Software businesses performed as anticipated with recurring revenues growing low single digits, again, benefited by high retention rates and high levels of recurring revenue. This segment underperformed our expectations primarily due to TransCore's New York congestion infrastructure project timing. In April, we expected approximately $75 million more in revenue from this project than actually occurred in 2020. More on this when we turn to the segment overview, but we expect this $75 million of pushed revenue to be recognized in '21. It's also worth noting that the number of toll tags shipped last year were at historic lows given the lower traffic volumes, but this was anticipated. 
For our MAS segment, we've talked all year about this being the tale of 4 situations: Verathon, Other Medical Products, Neptune and Industrial. For the year, again, back in April, we felt this group would be flat to up mid-single digits on an organic basis. We posted 1% growth. We feel very good about the execution across this group of companies. The primary reconciliation factor is a slower recovery ramp tied to our non-Verathon Medical product businesses and Neptune. Specifically, we anticipated unprecedented demand for Verathon's innovation product family. For the year, Verathon grew substantially as COVID accelerated the further adoption of video intubation as the preferred technology. Our other medical product businesses, which grow mid-single digits like clockwork, were down mid-single digits for the year, tied directly to lower elective procedure volumes and limited hospital capital spending. 
Interestingly for Neptune, we highlighted municipal budget uncertainty in April. This proved generally to be a nonfactor as municipalities budgets were approved and available. However, the impact of the lockdowns, especially in the Northeast U.S. and Canada, had a prolonged impact on our customers' ability to do routine meter replacements. As a result, Neptune was down low double digits for the year, slightly worse than our initial expectations. 
Finally, for this segment, we expected sharp industrial declines, and that is what happens with these businesses being down low double digits for the year. That said, we are seeing sequential quarterly improvements across both Neptune and our industrial businesses. 
Finally, and as it relates to our Process Tech segment, we expect it to be down 20% to 25%, and we were logging in at down 21%. This played out as we anticipated with much lower energy-related spending, project timing pushes and the inability to get field service resources into customer locations. So this is the play-by-play rewind for 2020. Now let's turn to the segment pages for a bit more detail. 
Next slide, please. For Application Software, where revenues here were $1.81 billion, up 1% organically with EBITDA of $772 million. The broad macro activity for this segment has remained quite consistent for much of 2020. Specifically, we continue to see accelerating demand for our cloud solutions. This bodes well for our long-term recurring revenue growth and customer intimacy. At a business unit level, Deltek's GovCon business continues to be super solid and grow very nicely. But we did see some headwinds relative to their offerings that target the consulting, marketing services and AEC space. That said, recent customer activity and top-of-funnel activity suggest some market falling is occurring. 
Aderant and PowerPlan delivered flat EBITDA in the year with nice recurring revenue gains. We experienced very nice growth across our lab software group, again doing our part to help fight the towed war. Strata delivered double-digit organic growth and completed a strategic acquisition in EPSi. Notably, the combined business will analyze roughly half of the U.S. hospital spend. Finally, our 2 businesses that serve the education space, Seaboard and Horizon, declined double digits in the year simply due to having a customer base that was shutdown. A decent amount of revenues in these businesses are tied to student volumes. Importantly, we acquired Vertafore last year. They're off to a great start with strong earnings and very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. 
Looking to Q1, we see flat to low single-digit organic growth based on continued mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth, offset slightly by lower perpetual and services revenues given last year's non-COVID comp. 
Now let's turn to our Network segment. Here, revenues were $1.74 billion, up 3% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $732 million. Our Network Software businesses performed well during last year, growing low single digits. Specifically, DAT was strong, growing double digits. DAT's network scale and innovation focus continues to enable very solid organic gains. ConstructConnect grew based on network utilization, tied to a tighter construction labor market. iTrade, MHA and Foundry had some headwinds tied to their end markets being disrupted due to COVID. That said, each of these businesses had high retention rates and the networks remain very strong. iPipeline also performed well during their first year being with Roper and completed 2 bolt-on acquisitions. 
Our nonsoftware businesses struggled a bit during the year. Specifically, RF IDeas, our multi-protocol prudential reader business, did well in their health care applications, but was hampered by meaningful declines in their secure print market. For the full year, TransCore pushed about $100 million of revenue out of 2020 into '21 associated with our New York project. In addition, EBITDA margins were pressured due to lower tag shipments and a few non-New York project pushouts. 
As we look to the first quarter of 2021, we see organic revenue, as you can see in the lower right-hand box, to be down 3% to 5% for the quarter. An important distinction to highlight, our software businesses will continue to grow in the low single-digit range. But our nonsoftware businesses, driven by TransCore, will decline in the high-teens range in the first quarter due to much lower anticipated tag shipments and timing of revenue associated with the New York projects. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year is coming off a mid-teens growth comp from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to our MAS segment. Revenues for the year were $1.47 billion, up 1% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $508 million. Verathon was awesome in 2020. The business grew substantially based on unprecedented demand for their video intubation product line. Demand was global. Given Verathon's ability to fulfill this demand, we expect our meaningfully expanded installed base of glide scopes to generate increased levels of reoccurring consumables pull-through in the years to come. In addition, the first year of their single-use bronchoscope release was successful. We believe we gained a substantial foothold in the market during the inaugural year of this product category. 
Our other med product businesses declined, but they started to see more normalized patient volumes towards the end of the year. Further, customer interactions are starting to resemble more normal levels of engagement. Neptune declined low double digits tied exclusively to our customers in the northeastern U.S. and Canada not having access to indoor meters. Other regions were flat during 2020. Neptune's market share remains strong throughout the year. 
Finally, our Industrial businesses were down but have shown sequential improvements throughout the year. For Q1, we expect low single-digit organic growth for this segment with similar patterns to that of the fourth quarter. 
Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. Revenues for the year were $519 million, down 21% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $156 million or 30% of revenue. Compared versus 2 years ago, these businesses are down about $90 million in EBITDA and yet maintained 30% EBITDA margins. Congrats and thanks to our leadership team for their continued exceptional execution. As a side note, Roper continued to compound despite these cyclical headwinds. That said, this segment is pretty straightforward and has been the same story all year. COVID has negatively impacted our oil and gas and short-cycle businesses. Certainly, lower oil prices did not help either. That said, we have seen some green shoots across this group as capital spending started to improve as we exited 2020. As we look to the first quarter, we expect declines to moderate in the first quarter to be in the 10% range. Importantly, we have easing comps as we enter the second quarter. Also, over the last couple of years, these businesses continue to make product and channel investments to be best positioned to fully capture this cyclical upswing. The next few years here should be pretty good. 
Now let's turn to our guidance and the associated framework. While this slide is somewhat busy, we wanted to line up for you the key macro differences between our 2021 full year outlook on a segment basis versus our actual 2020 results. In aggregate, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid-teens range with organic growth being in the mid-single-digit-plus area. As we look across the revenue streams for our Application Software segment, we expect mid-singles growth. Specifically, we expect a slightly improved recurring revenue growth rate aided by last year's recurring momentum and an increased mix towards SaaS. We expect flat services revenues and mid-single-digit plus growth in perpetual as we expect a modest market recovery and easing second half comps. 
Similarly, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth in our Network segment with our Network Software businesses growing mid-single digit plus. We expect TransCore to complete the New York project and see recovering tag sales. When combined, TransCore should grow mid-singles for the year. 
We expect MAS to grow mid-single digits as well. Our medical product businesses were exceptional last year, up 20%. Importantly, the quality of our Medical products revenue stream will continue to improve as Verathon's reoccurring revenue streams tied to Glidescope and BFLEX continue to gain momentum. As we look to 2021, our medical product businesses are expected to grow low single digits as elective procedures and hospital capital spending returned to more normalized levels throughout 2021, this return being partially offset by our difficult 2020 COVID comp. Neptune should be up high single digits plus with easing restrictions and more access to indoor meter replacements. And finally, our industrial businesses should recover and grow in the high single-digit plus range after 2 years of declines. 
Our PT businesses are expected to be up high single digits through the year based on the resumption of deferred projects and field maintenance as well as modest improvements in these end markets. So all in all, we expect organic revenues to increase mid-single digits plus and total revenue to grow in the mid-teens range. 
Let's turn to our guidance slide. Based on what we just outlined, when you roll everything together, we're establishing our 2021 full year adjusted debt guidance to be in the range of 14 35 and 14 75. Our tax rate should be in the 21% to 22% range. For the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted debt guidance to be between 3 26 and 3 32. Of note, our guided Q1 adjusted debt is roughly 22% to 23% of our full year guidance range and is consistent with our long-term historical depth seasonality. 
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. What a year. None of us will ever forget 2020. Our business performed so very well last year. We grew revenue 3% in aggregate and only declined a single percent on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were steady at 35.8%, and cash flow grew 16% to $1.7 billion. This means we had cash flow margins of 30%. Just amazing. Given this performance, our business model's ability to foresee this performance, we stayed focused on executing our capital deployment strategy, which resulted in $6 billion of deployment on high-quality, niche-leading vertical software companies. There is no doubt the quality of our enterprise improved during 2020, something we're incredibly proud to be able to say. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits, we increased innovation investments and increased the quality of our portfolio with our capital deployment spend. 
So as we look to 2021, we feel we are incredibly well positioned. We expect strong organic growth that will be further augmented by contributions from our recent acquisitions. In 2021, we expect about 2/3 of our EBITDA to come from our software businesses, which provides us all the virtues of an increased mix towards recurring revenues. We will continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, but we remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. So as we look back over 2020, we are proud of our business model's durability and our leaders' ability to successfully navigate last year's uncertainties. We are proud that we continue to be forward-leaning and strategic. We are proud that we improved our business last year with an increasing mix of growing recurring revenue and continued innovation focus. In short, we got bigger and better during 2020. 
As we turn to your questions, I'll remind everyone that at Roper, we operate a low-risk model whose strategy centers on acquiring fantastic businesses and then providing them with an environment where they can get even better over the long arc of time. This was certainly the case in 2020. 
So with that, let's turn to our first question."

We expect about -- the recovery in '21 to be about half of what we are down. We're seeing strength. We've seen continued strength all year in the -- in 2020 in the perpetual book of business, in Deltek's GovCon business. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're seeing showing and some activity in their professional services end markets that's encouraging. These are the architects, the engineers, the contractors, the marketing services firms, the consulting firms, those -- that book of business. 
In addition, the other large parts of the perpetual book are at Aderant and PowerPlan. Aderant has its own unique set of competitive factors where the customers have to -- the customers that have not upgraded their software from -- the competitive customers that not upgraded their software have to upgrade, and we're winning a large percentage of those. And so all that activity just got pushed to the right a bit, and that's somewhat encouraging and pipeline activity is positive there. And then PowerPlan's pipeline activity is full. It has a handful of large opportunities in it, which are obviously hard to predict the exact timing, but we actually like the pipeline build across the companies that have the primary book of perpetual business."

So that's part of what the last 3 quarters of the year will look like as well. 
When you look at it on a company by -- or sort of segment-by-segment basis, just rolling through, basically, it's the perpetual book of business and the associated services that come with that for Application Software that ramps back up. In network, they're really -- for the Network businesses, it's a little bit of ramp back at foundry. It's a little bit of ramp back at that iTrade. But the other businesses were pretty steady as she goes, DAT, ConstructConnect, et cetera. TransCore stands by itself. It's tied principally to 2 things: one is the New York project completing; and second, the return of traffic volumes and the associated tags that go with them. 
For the MAS segment, it's Neptune just sequentially coming back and importantly, getting the the access to the indoor meters in Northeast U.S. and Canada. I said in the prepared remarks, market share was super steady, maybe plus a little bit in that business last year. It's just access -- our customers getting access to do retain replacements. Verathon will have a difficult headwind because of the capital place we talked about. But the other medical product businesses just rotate up in a sequential basis. And then finally, the industrial businesses do the same. Process is much like industrial, just a cyclical rebound, modestly higher oil prices help. But you have all this in the energy businesses, you have all this deferred maintenance that's got to get done. There's a lot of -- there's sort of -- there were some restocking orders in the fourth quarter there and then some pipeline activity like we got to get in and do the maintenance in a handful of these important customers. So that would be sort of the color of the ramp, but no step function. But Rob, what would you add if anything?"

So that's the first thing I'd say. 
Second is when you look at the art of the possible, if you think about a business that is 100% SaaS recurring revenue that's prepaid a year ahead, let's say, that you bill on January 1 and you take 90 days to get paid, that company is going to have 75% of its revenue. That's negative net working capital, right? And we certainly have a couple of businesses that don't quite get to 75%, but they approach 40% or 50%. So as we become more software and our legacy perpetual business becomes more Saas, you're going to see this number get higher. Will it ever get to 40% to 50%? No, it won't. But it will keep inching higher. It should over the next 5 to 10 years. We don't have a target. It's not that we're trying to drive the business to be x percent negative.

So as a result, there is not a short term. We've got to do these 5 things to improve the business. That's not in our strategic M&A strategy. That said, the business is -- as in the piece of research you did, we thought was quite good and reflective of ours. It's basically a duopoly. We share a market with 1 principal competitor on the agency side. Fortunately, for us, just after the business -- we acquired the business and closed, we won the largest deal in the market in the last 3 or 4 years in assured partners. There was a press release that went out a handful of weeks ago. So we're delighted about that. It's a slow ramp over a couple of years, a couple, 3 years. I think that's just an indication of the quality of the business that Vertafore and the products they have. But also the customer, in that case, was reassured by being -- by Vertafore being owned by Roper who is just a long-term owner that's not going to look to sell the business in a handful of years, and therefore, you can make the right investments. 
If there is one thing that we're, if you will, doing in the short run is based on our diligence and similar to work you did is we wanted to allocate a little bit more to R&D, which we have done. That's reflected in the numbers we've given you from the very beginning.

This coming year, probably going to add about 100 basis points, to be a little over 9%. There's Vertafore mix in there that they have a little bit higher percentage as compared to some of our other businesses. But I think you will see and are seeing an increase in innovation there. So that sort of stopped there. I mean if you have any follow-ups, we're happy to do it. But the short answer is yes. 
I guess there's one other thing. If you compare Roper's, the 8% or 9% of revenue that we spend in R&D compared to other software companies, it appears low. When you look at our software businesses, we're right in line with the peers. We're between 10% and 15%, 17% depending on the company. The application businesses tend to be on the higher side of that. The network businesses tend to be on the lower side of that. And the reason the mix for Roper is low is because we have quite a bit of revenue in TransCore, MHA and others that effectively don't have any R&D in our business model. So it's always important to point out when we get asked a question about R&D."

I thought it was interesting when you mentioned GovCon's stability versus maybe some of the professional services being impacted by COVID. The GovCon, I would imagine you're dealing with large enterprise customers. So we should expect it to be kind of stable, in addition to just general government spending being stable? On the professional side, is it just a matter of reopening? Or is there anything we can think about with respect to customer size, large versus SMB? And then maybe end markets specifically that we should be looking at for the recovery? Is it just non-residential construction on the AEC side?

But if there are pockets of concentration, it's in architects, engineers and contractors. Obviously, the contractors, mostly non-res contractors, in this case, they are the ones that are a little bit worried, and they've sort of tightened up a little bit more. It's the architects and engineering firms that have shown some green shoots here in Q4.

So when you come back on this side, the license activity will pick up sooner, but then you got to -- and the services work will follow back behind it.

For today's agenda, we'll walk through our 2020 financials and operational highlights. Then we'll turn to our 2020 segment detailed results and discuss our '21 segment-by-segment outlook and end with our '21 enterprise guidance prior to discussing your questions. Next slide, please. 
As we look back on 2020, it was quite a year. Our businesses performed at a very high level during this period. Revenues grew 3% with organic revenue declining a single percent. EBITDA also grew 3%, and free cash flow grew 16%. This cash flow performance, $1.7 billion, is just astounding. This is a testament to many things, notably our asset-light business model, the intimacy we have with our customers and the high level of skill and execution of our field teams. This cash flow is just simply a great result.  
Perhaps more important, 2020 was a year of forward progress for our company. We exit 2020 as a better company, a company with higher-quality revenue streams, a company with improved future innovation prospects and a company with whose portfolio was enhanced with $6 billion of capital deployment. To this end, we saw our software recurring revenues increase mid-single digits in 2020 and were benefited by high levels of retention and an acceleration to the cloud.  
We continue to be benefited by having close intimate relationships with our customers. Most often, our software is mission-critical to our customers' operations. 
In addition, we continue to strategically invest throughout our portfolio during the year. Based on our historical experience, we find times of market disruption the best time to double down on innovation and market investments which, in turn, will drive market share gains in the years to come. Finally, we were able to deploy $6 billion to further enhance Roper's group of companies, headlined by our Vertafore acquisition. 
So when we look back on 2020, we highlight 2 key themes. First, we grew. Cash flow increased 16% in the middle of a pandemic. And second, the quality of our enterprise continued to improve during the year. Net-net, we got bigger and better during 2020. Let's turn to the next slide. 
Over the past 5 years, we highlight that our revenue grew at a 9% compounded rate, EBITDA at 10% and cash flow at 13%. We continue to grow and compound through macroeconomic cycles. Also, during the time period, the quality of our enterprise meaningfully improved. We are more software focused with nearly 2/3 of our EBITDA coming from software with higher levels of recurring revenue. Conversely, we are much less tied to cyclical end markets today, a little over 15% of our portfolio.  
Given our long-term strategy and these factors, we are a low-risk enterprise. We compound cash flow through cycle and do so with multiple growth drivers across both organic and inorganic fronts. As we look to '21, we will continue our long-term string of revenue and EBITDA and cash flow compounding.  
So with that, let's turn to the next page and discuss the macro backdrop for '21. As we look to 2021, we are set up for a strong year. We expect revenue and EBITDA will grow well into the double digits, likely in the mid-teens range, with organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit plus range. This is on top of growth in 2020. The compounding continues.  
Breaking it down. Our software businesses, both in our Application Software and network segments, are well positioned heading into '21. These businesses entered the year with momentum from strong retention and recurring revenue gains. They'll be further aided by growth in perpetual license as pipeline and customer activity are anticipated to recover to some extent. 
Our non-Verathon medical product businesses are expected to return to a more normalized pattern of customer activity as health care facilities loosen restrictions. But since 2020 was well below trend, we expect above-trend growth here. Of note, Verathon has a challenging comp. However, the reoccurring revenue base will remain strong given the large volume of capital placements in 2020 and continued growth of their new single-use bronchoscope business. 
We expect Neptune to recover and grow nicely as our customers especially in the Northeast U.S. and Canada gain access to residential locations. We expect our industrial and process tech businesses to continue their quarterly improvements and return to growth after 2 years of macro headwinds. 
Finally, 2021 will be meaningfully aided by the contribution from our 2020 cohort of acquisitions. To this end, we continue to work with a very full and high-quality M&A pipeline. We are committed to deleveraging, but we also remain active in building and maturing our pipe.  
So as I think back over the nearly 10 years I've been with Roper, I cannot think of a better set of tailwinds heading into a year. Clearly, lots to do and lots of execution in front of us, but we have a strong momentum heading into '21. 
So now let me turn the call over to Rob. Rob?"

Turning to Page 8, looking at our Q4 income statement performance. Total revenue increased 8% as we eclipsed $1.5 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 2% versus prior year. 
EBITDA grew 7% in the quarter to a record $552 million. EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points versus prior year at 36.6%. Tax rate came in at 19.9%, a little lower than last year's 21.6%. So all in, this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.56, which is above our guidance range.  
Next slide. Turning to Page 9 and reviewing the Q4 results by segment. Neil will discuss the full year 2020 segment performance in more detail later so just touching on some of the Q4 highlights here by segment. 
Application Software grew 35% with the addition of Vertafore. Organic for the segment was minus 2% with mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth continuing. Sharp declines in our CBORD and Horizon businesses serving K-12 and higher education impacted the segment as many schools unfortunately remain closed. 
For Network Software & Systems, plus 2% organic growth with our software businesses, putting up a very solid plus 4% organic. And TransCore was flat versus prior year. 
For Measurement & Analytical Solutions, plus 1% organic growth as we start to see some sequential recovery in Neptune and our industrial businesses. Segment margins were impacted a bit by the acceleration of some product and channel investments at Verathon, as we discussed, coming into the quarter, and it's really been an exceptional year for Verathon overall.  
Lastly, for Process Technologies, a 21% organic decline, with margins holding up well at 31.3%. And once again, here, we started to see some early signs of improvement after a couple of years of declines.  
Next slide. So turning to Page 10, looking at net working capital. Honestly, the slide mostly speaks for itself, ending the quarter with negative 8% net working capital as a percentage of Q4 annualized revenue. 
While there are certainly some seasonal trends, primarily around timing of software renewals, they do typically benefit our Q4 performance. You can see here a meaningful improvement versus 2018, improving from negative 3.4% to negative 8% in 2020. Our asset-light negative net working capital model drives our sustainable high cash conversion and fuels our cash flow compounding.  
Our people focus on what we all believe matters, and our culture is built around growing the right way. Top line growth converts to cash flow, and we are always mindful of impacts to our balance sheet.  
Next slide. So turning to cash flow. Cash flow performance, as Neil mentioned, was really pretty spectacular no matter how you look at it. Q4 free cash flow of $558 million was 23% higher than last year and represented 37% of revenue. This excellent result was driven by the great working capital performance I just discussed, which is really across the enterprise, along with meaningful cash contributions from Vertafore and the other recent acquisitions. 
So for the full year 2020, we generated $1.72 billion of operating cash flow and $1.67 billion of free cash flow. So to repeat, that's $1.7 billion of free cash flow in 2020, truly a great year. Full year free cash flow growth was 16%, and our free cash flow conversion from EBITDA was a robust 84%. So really tremendous cash flow performance, and it was broad-based and very durable.  
Next slide. So turning to Page 12, updating on our balance sheet. As Neil mentioned earlier, we ended the year with total capital deployment of approximately $6 billion, which included the EPSi acquisition that closed during the fourth quarter on October 15. We were able to take advantage of attractive market conditions to complete and opportunistically fund these acquisitions with a combination of internally generated cash flow, proceeds from our 2019 Gatan divestiture and investment-grade leverage. Overall cost of financing was approximately 1%.  
Thanks to our excellent Q4 cash performance, we are off to a great start on our plan to quickly reduce leverage, paying down to around $500 million since we closed the EPSi deal. Looking ahead, we plan to rapidly reduce leverage throughout 2021, taking advantage of our prepayable revolver, which has a current balance of approximately $1.6 billion. Our solid investment-grade balance sheet supports long-term cash flow compounding, which we are well positioned to continue.  
So with that, I'll pass it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks."

To help orient you to this page, we're comparing our full year outlook from last April to that of what actually happened. 
It's worth reminding everyone that we felt our businesses and our business model had the level of recurring revenue, customer intimacy and the business leadership required to guide in the face of the COVID uncertainty, both in terms of supply and demand. In aggregate, we thought our full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat, and we came in at down minus 1%. The TransCore New York project is the primary reconciling item between being down a touch and being flat or slightly up, and more on this in a minute. 
We guided DEPS to be between $11.60 and $12.60 and came in at $12.74. Looking back on this, we are very proud of our team's ability to look forward and operate through the uncertainty of last year. Also, there is no better example of the durability of our model than this past year.  
With that, let's walk through the macro drivers across each of our 4 segments. Relative to Application Software, this segment played out as anticipated and was up 1% on an organic basis for the year. Specifically, we saw recurring revenue up mid-single digits, aided by very strong retention rates as well as an acceleration to the cloud. As a reminder, recurring revenue in this segment is about 70% of our revenue stream.  
Perpetual revenues, about 10% of this segment's revenue, were under pressure as expected. We saw this revenue stream down mid-teens as new logo opportunities and wins were pushed and delayed. That said, cross-selling activity remained active for much of 2020. 
Relative to services revenue, we anticipated some pressure tied to shifting to remote installs and having fewer new implementations, which are tied to new perpetual transactions. For 2020, we saw mid-single-digit declines here, principally tied to fewer new deals. Our teams did a wonderful job shifting to remote installs, a trend we anticipate will continue in large part on the backside of the pandemic.  
As it relates to our network segment, we expected organic revenue for the year to be up mid-singles to double digits when, in fact, we grew 3% for the full year. Our network software businesses performed as anticipated with recurring revenues growing low single digits, again benefited by high retention rates and high levels of recurring revenue. This segment underperformed our expectations primarily due to TransCore's New York congestion infrastructure project timing. 
In April, we expected approximately $75 million more in revenue from this project than actually occurred in 2020. More on this when we turn to the segment overview, but we expect this $75 million of pushed revenue to be recognized in '21. It's also worth noting that the number of toll tags shipped last year were at historic lows given the lower traffic volumes, but this was anticipated.  
For our MAS segment, we've talked all year about this being the tale of 4 situations: Verathon, other medical products, Neptune and industrial. For the year, again, back in April, we felt this group would be flat to up mid-single digits on an organic basis. We posted 1% growth. We feel very good about the execution across this group of companies. The primary reconciliation factor is a slower recovery ramp tied to our non-Verathon medical product businesses and Neptune. 
Specifically, we anticipated unprecedented demand for Verathon's innovation product family. For the year, Verathon grew substantially as COVID accelerated the further adoption of video intubation as the preferred technology. Our other medical product businesses, which grow mid-single digits like clockwork, were down mid-single digits for the year, tied directly to lower elective procedure volumes and limited hospital capital spending.  
Interestingly for Neptune, we highlighted municipal budget uncertainty in April. This proved generally to be a nonfactor as municipalities budgets were approved and available. However, the impact of the lockdowns, especially in the Northeast U.S. and Canada, had a prolonged impact on our customers' ability to do routine meter replacements. As a result, Neptune was down low double digits for the year, slightly worse than our initial expectations.  
Finally for this segment, we expected sharp industrial declines, and that is what happened with these businesses being down low double digits for the year. That said, we are seeing sequential quarterly improvements across both Neptune and our industrial businesses.  
Finally and as it relates to our process tech segment, we expected it to be down 20% to 25%, and we were, logging in at down 21%. This played out as we anticipated with much lower energy-related spending, project timing pushes and the inability to get field service resources into customer locations. So this is the play-by-play rewind for 2020. Now let's turn to the segment pages for a bit more detail.  
Next slide, please. For Application Software, revenues here were $1.81 billion, up 1% organically, with EBITDA of $772 million. The broad macro activity for this segment has remained quite consistent for much of 2020. Specifically, we continue to see accelerating demand for our cloud solutions. This bodes well for our long-term recurring revenue growth and customer intimacy. 
At a business-unit level, Deltek's GovCon business continues to be super solid and grow very nicely. But we did see some headwinds relative to their offerings that target the consulting, marketing services and AEC space. That said, recent customer activity and top-of-funnel activity suggest some market falling is occurring.  
Aderant and PowerPlan delivered flat EBITDA in the year with nice recurring revenue gains. We experienced very nice growth across our lab software group, again doing our part to help fight the COVID war. Strata delivered double-digit organic growth and completed a strategic acquisition in EPSi. Notably, the combined business will annualize roughly half of the U.S. hospital spend. 
Finally, our 2 businesses that serve the education space, CBORD and Horizon, declined double digits in the year simply due to having a customer base that was shutdown. A decent amount of revenues in these businesses are tied to student volumes. Importantly, we acquired Vertafore last year. They're off to a great start with strong earnings and very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Looking to Q1, we see flat to low single-digit organic growth based on continued mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth, offset slightly by lower perpetual and services revenues given last year's non-COVID comp.  
Now let's turn to our Network segment. Here, revenues were $1.74 billion, up 3% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $732 million. Our network software businesses performed well during last year, growing low single digits. Specifically, DAT was strong, growing double digits. DAT's network scale and innovation focus continues to enable very solid organic gains. 
ConstructConnect grew based on network utilization tied to a tighter construction labor market. iTrade, MHA and Foundry had some headwinds tied to their end markets being disrupted due to COVID. That said, each of these businesses had high retention rates and the networks remain very strong. iPipeline also performed well during their first year being with Roper and completed 2 bolt-on acquisitions.  
Our non-software businesses struggled a bit during the year. Specifically, RF IDeas, our multi-protocol credential reader business, did well in their health care applications but was hampered by meaningful declines in their secure print market. For the full year, TransCore pushed about $100 million of revenue out of 2020 into '21 associated with our New York project. In addition, EBITDA margins were pressured due to lower tag shipments and a few non-New York project pushouts.  
As we look to the first quarter of 2021, we see organic revenue, as you can see in the lower right-hand box, to be down 3% to 5% for the quarter. An important distinction to highlight, our software businesses will continue to grow in the low single-digit range but our non-software businesses, driven by TransCore, will decline in the high-teens range in the first quarter due to much lower anticipated tag shipments and timing of revenue associated with the New York projects. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year is coming off a mid-teens growth comp from a year ago.  
Now let's turn to our MAS segment. Revenues for the year were $1.47 billion, up 1% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $508 million. Verathon was awesome in 2020. The business grew substantially based on unprecedented demand for their video intubation product line. Demand was global. 
Given Verathon's ability to fulfill this demand, we expect our meaningfully expanded installed base of GlideScopes to generate increased levels of reoccurring consumables pull-through in the years to come. In addition, the first year of their single-use bronchoscope release was successful. We believe we gained a substantial foothold in the market during the inaugural year of this product category.  
Our other med product businesses declined, but they started to see more normalized patient volumes towards the end of the year. Further, customer interactions are starting to resemble more normal levels of engagement. Neptune declined low double digits tied exclusively to our customers in the Northeastern U.S. and Canada not having access to indoor meters. Other regions were flat during 2020. Neptune's market share remains strong throughout the year.  
Finally, our industrial businesses were down but have shown sequential improvements throughout the year. For Q1, we expect low single-digit organic growth for this segment with similar patterns to that of the fourth quarter.  
Now let's turn to our final segment, process tech. Revenues for the year were $519 million, down 21% on an organic basis with EBITDA of $156 million or 30% of revenue. Compared versus 2 years ago, these businesses are down about $90 million in EBITDA and yet maintained 30% EBITDA margins. Congrats and thanks to our leadership team for their continued exceptional execution. As a side note, Roper continued to compound despite these cyclical headwinds. 
That said, this segment is pretty straightforward and has been the same story all year. COVID has negatively impacted our oil and gas and short-cycle businesses. Certainly, low oil prices did not help either. That said, we have seen some green shoots across this group as capital spending started to improve as we exited 2020. 
As we look to the first quarter, we expect declines to moderate in the first quarter to be in the 10% range. Importantly, we have easing comps as we enter the second quarter. Also, over the last couple of years, these businesses continue to make product and channel investments to be best positioned to fully capture this cyclical upswing. The next few years here should be pretty good.  
Now let's turn to our guidance and the associated framework. While this slide is somewhat busy, we wanted to line up for you the key macro differences between our 2021 full year outlook on a segment basis versus our actual 2020 results. In aggregate, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid-teens range with organic growth being in the mid-single-digit-plus area. 
As we look across the revenue streams for our Application Software segment, we expect mid-singles growth. Specifically, we expect a slightly improved recurring revenue growth rate aided by last year's recurring momentum and an increased mix towards SaaS. We expect flat services revenues and mid-single-digit-plus growth in perpetual as we expect a modest market recovery and easing second half comps.  
Similarly, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth in our network segment with our network software businesses growing mid-single digit plus. We expect TransCore to complete the New York project and see recovering tag sales. When combined, TransCore should grow mid-singles for the year.  
We expect MAS to grow mid-single digits as well. Our medical product businesses were exceptional last year, up 20%. Importantly, the quality of our medical products revenue stream will continue to improve as Verathon's reoccurring revenue streams tied to GlideScope and BFlex continue to gain momentum. As we look to 2021, our medical product businesses are expected to grow low single digits as elective procedures and hospital capital spending return to more normalized levels throughout 2021, this return being partially offset by our difficult 2020 COVID comp. 
Neptune should be up high single digits plus with easing restrictions and more access to indoor meter replacements. And finally, our industrial businesses should recover and grow in the high single-digit plus range after 2 years of declines.  
Our PT businesses are expected to be up high single digits through the year based on the resumption of deferred projects and field maintenance as well as modest improvements in these end markets. So all in all, we expect organic revenues to increase mid-single digits plus and total revenue to grow in the mid-teens range.  
Let's turn to our guidance slide. Based on what we just outlined, when you roll everything together, we're establishing our 2021 full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $14.35 and $14.75. Our tax rate should be in the 21% to 22% range. 
For the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.26 and $3.32. Of note, our guided Q1 adjusted DEPS is roughly 22% to 23% of our full year guidance range and is consistent with our long-term historical DEPS seasonality.  
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. What a year. None of us will ever forget 2020. 
Our business performed so very well last year. We grew revenue 3% in aggregate and only declined a single percent on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were steady at 35.8%, and cash flow grew 16% to $1.7 billion. This means we had cash flow margins of 30%. Just amazing. 
Given this performance, our business model's ability to foresee this performance, we stayed focused on executing our capital deployment strategy, which resulted in $6 billion of deployment on high-quality, niche-leading vertical software companies. There is no doubt the quality of our enterprise improved during 2020, something we're incredibly proud to be able to say. Our recurring revenue grew mid-single digits, we increased innovation investments and increased the quality of our portfolio with our capital deployment spend.  
So as we look to 2021, we feel we are incredibly well positioned. We expect strong organic growth that will be further augmented by contributions from our recent acquisitions. In 2021, we expect about 2/3 of our EBITDA to come from our software businesses, which provides us all the virtues of an increased mix towards recurring revenues. We will continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, but we remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. 
So as we look back over 2020, we are proud of our business model's durability and our leaders' ability to successfully navigate last year's uncertainties. We are proud that we continue to be forward-leaning and strategic. We are proud that we improved our business last year with an increasing mix of growing recurring revenue and continued innovation focus. In short, we got bigger and better during 2020.  
As we turn to your questions, I'll remind everyone that at Roper, we operate a low-risk model whose strategy centers on acquiring fantastic businesses and then providing them with an environment where they can get even better over the long arc of time. This was certainly the case in 2020.  
So with that, let's turn to our first question."

We're seeing strength. We've seen continued strength all year in the -- in 2020 in the perpetual book of business, in Deltek's GovCon business. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're seeing thawing and some activity in their professional services end markets that's encouraging.

In network, they're really -- for the network businesses, it's a little bit of ramp back at Foundry, it's a little bit of ramp back at iTrade. But the other businesses were pretty steady as she goes, DAT, ConstructConnect, et cetera. 
TransCore stands by itself. It's tied principally to 2 things. One is the New York project completing; and second, the return of traffic volumes and the associated tags that go with them. 
For the MAS segment, it's Neptune just sequentially coming back and importantly, getting the access to the indoor meters in Northeast U.S. and Canada. I said in the prepared remarks, market share was super steady, maybe plus a little bit in that business last year. It's just access -- our customers getting access to do retain/replacements. 
Verathon will have a difficult headwind because of the capital placement we talked about. But the other medical product businesses just rotate up in a sequential basis. And then finally, the industrial businesses do the same. 
Process is much like industrial, just a cyclical rebound. Modestly higher oil prices help. But you have all this -- in the energy businesses, you have all this deferred maintenance that's got to get done. There's a lot of -- there's sort of -- there were some restocking orders in the fourth quarter there and then some pipeline activities like we got to get in and do the maintenance in a handful of these important customers. 
So that would be sort of the color of the ramp, but no step function. But Rob, what would you add, if anything?"

So that's the first thing I'd say. 
Second is when you look at the art of the possible, if you think about a business that is 100% SaaS recurring revenue that's prepaid a year ahead, let's say that you bill on January 1 and you take 90 days to get paid, that company is going to have 75% of its revenue. That's negative net working capital, right? And we certainly have a couple of businesses that don't quite get to 75% but they approach 40% or 50%. 
So as we become more software and our legacy perpetual business becomes more SaaS, you're going to see this number get higher. Will it ever get to 40% to 50%? No, it won't. But it will keep inching higher, it should, over the next 5 to 10 years. 
We don't have a target. It's not that we're trying to drive the business to be X percent negative. We just have an incentive system and a culture that we get a little bit better every year on this metric."

So as a result, there is not a short-term ""we've got to do these 5 things to improve the business."" That's not in our strategic M&A strategy. 
That said, the business is -- as in the piece of research you did, we thought, was quite good and reflective of ours. It's basically a duopoly. We share a market with 1 principal competitor on the agency side. Fortunately for us, just after the business -- we acquired the business and closed, we won the largest deal in the market in the last 3 or 4 years in assured partners. There was a press release that went out a handful of weeks ago. So we're delighted about that. 
It's a slow ramp over a couple of years, a couple, 3 years. I think that's just an indication of the quality of the business that Vertafore and the products they have. But also the customer, in that case, was reassured by being -- by Vertafore being owned by Roper who is just a long-term owner that's not going to look to sell the business in a handful of years, and therefore, you can make the right investments. 
If there is one thing that we're, if you will, doing in the short run, based on our diligence and similar to work you did, it's we wanted to allocate a little bit more to R&D, which we have done. That's reflected in the numbers we've given you from the very beginning.

In addition to Vertafore and maybe ramping R&D there, are there any opportunities to ramp R&D across some of the other business units simply because there's new market opportunities as a result of the pandemic moving forward?

So a few things I'd say there to begin with. First is when we engage with each of our businesses strategically, we talk to them broadly about how to grow sustainably with CRI-accretive growth over a long arc of time, answering the 2 questions of where to play and how to win. But then when you get into how to win, it is -- sometimes it's a product answer. A lot of times, it's a go-to-market or market -- go-to-market effective sort of answer. So it's not -- our strategic orientation of each business doesn't narrow into innovation from the get-go. 
That said, obviously, innovation and R&D, we're mostly a D shop, mostly development across our software and product businesses. You have seen and likely will continue to see a modest increase in R&D spend as a percent of revenue for years to come. In '19, it was about 7.5%. Last year, it's about a little over 8%. This coming year, we're probably going to add about 100 basis points to be a little over 9%. There's Vertafore mix in there that they have a little bit higher percentage as compared to some of our other businesses. But I think you will see and are seeing an increase in innovation there. 
The -- so I'd sort of stop there. I mean if you have any follow-ups, we're happy to do it. But the short answer is yes. 
I guess there's one other thing. If you compare Roper's 8% or 9% of revenue that we spend in R&D compared to other software companies, it appears low. When you look at our software businesses, we're right in line with the peers. We're between 10% and 15%, 17% depending on the company. The application businesses tend to be on the higher side of that. The network businesses tend to be on the lower side of that. 
And the reason the mix for Roper is low is because we have quite a bit of revenue in TransCore, MHA and others that effectively don't have any R&D in our business model. So it's always important to point it out when we get asked a question about R&D."

The GovCon, I would imagine you're dealing with large enterprise customers so we should expect it to be kind of stable, in addition to just general government spending being stable. 
On the professional side, is it just a matter of reopening? Or is there anything we can think about with respect to customer size, large versus SMB?

That might drive some M&A activity, by the way, which is generally good for us. 
On the professional services side, the book of business here is broad. But if there are pockets of concentration, it's in architects, engineers and contractors.

So there's going to be -- some teams and some companies may choose to hold margins and they're going to have to -- because there's opportunity cost inside the business somewhere.

So you had low license activity basically through Q4. 
The services book of business had a little bit of a backlog, right? So the services were continued in Q2, continued a little bit in Q3, completed the in-flight projects. And then it sort of slowed down a handful of months behind the license activity. 
So when you come back on this side, the license activity will pick up sooner, but then you got to -- and the services work will follow back behind it.

growing approximately 6% on an organic basis. Importantly, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions, led by Vertafore, continued to perform very well versus our expectations. When we put this all together, we experienced double-digit growth across virtually all financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, debt and cash bridging with about $500 million in debt paydown during the quarter. Based on this encouraging start, we're increasing our outlook and guidance for the full year. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rob to review the financial details. Rob?"

Turning to Page 6, and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last",330,"Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6, and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last year's plus 4% pre pandemic comp.  EBITDA grew 20% to $561 million. EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 36.7% on really great incrementals across the portfolio. Adjusted debts was $3.60, 18% above prior year. Free cash flow was $543 million, up 54%. 
We continue to benefit from our business transformation to a more software weighted model where working capital boost cash flow as our growth accelerates. Our results were enhanced a bit by approximately $40 million of accelerated payments that were the result of wins at our U.K.-based Clinisys laboratory software business. Aided by our outstanding cash flow performance, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter, more on that to follow.  So in summary, a great start to 2021. 
Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update on our deleveraging. The charts on this page are a good preview for how we expect 2021 to look as we follow through on our commitment to reduce debt after our 2020 opportunistic capital deployment. As each quarter passes by, we will benefit from meaningfully improved trailing EBITDA as the performance of last year's acquisitions rolls into Roper's financials. EBITDA is then further enhanced by our accelerating organic growth. 
Concurrently, our strong cash conversion allows us to apply our high levels of excess free cash flow toward consistent reduction of our debt. In the first quarter, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million. Over the first 3 months of the year, our EBITDA growth, combined with debt reduction, enabled us to lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7 to 4.2. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance."
22751,710870368,2258796,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. As we turn to Page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is about 7",1810,"Thanks, Rob. As we turn to Page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. 
Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 6%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Of note, this quarter should be the last quarter of nonrecurring revenue declines as we come across the COVID comp from last year. 
From a business unit perspective, Deltek continued its long string of great performance. As we expected, Deltek's recurring revenue grew nicely. Of particular importance, Deltek saw an increase to their perpetual revenue during the quarter coming off a decently strong quarter a year ago. Also encouraging was the nature of the bookings activity which was broad-based across our architecture, engineering, creative and government contracting end markets. For reference, the professional services end markets tied to AEC and creative have been slow since the onset of COVID. Also, CliniSys, our European lab software business just crushed it during the quarter. As Rob mentioned, CliniSys had exceptionally strong cash flow as they gained tremendous market share within the clinical lab consolidation occurring within the United Kingdom. CliniSys has approximately 85% market share in the U.K. and is now recognized as 1 of 4 critical IT vendors for the entire national health service, just outstanding execution by the CliniSys team, and congrats. 
We also saw thawing in the higher education markets that CBORD serves, certainly encouraging. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continues to perform very well. Specific to Vertafore, we continue to be encouraged by their customers' comfort in having Roper as a long-term owner for the business. Also, Amy and her team have done a great job transitioning to Roper and our governance model. 
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on the expectation for sustained levels of recurring revenue growth and the resumption of nonrecurring revenue growth. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect our growth to be a touch below high single digits due to our global lab software group coming off across a challenging comp from a year ago as they are instrumental standing up COVID testing on a global basis, a solid and encouraging quarter for sure. 
And with that, let's turn to our next slide, please. Turning to Page 10, revenue in our network segment were $440 million, flat versus last year and down 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 40.9% in the quarter. Our software businesses in the segment, about 65% of the revenues, were up 4% on an organic basis. This revenue was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 6%. Recurring revenue growth is underpinned by strong customer retention. Recurring revenues are also benefited by increasing network participation. 
At the business level, our freight match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada continued to be solid growers for us. As a reminder, our freight match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking-shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers. We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. 
And lastly, as it relates to our network software businesses, we saw improved end market activity, especially in the middle market for foundry, our media and entertainment compositing software business. 
Our non software businesses in this segment were down 13% for the quarter, a touch better than we anticipated. TransCore's New York project work continues and is tracking well. TransCore's tag volumes declined versus a year ago based on lower traffic volumes across the U.S. 
Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment with consistent high single-digit growth through the balance of the year for our network software businesses. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we anticipate our segment organic growth to be a touch below HSD given TransCore should be stronger in the second half versus next quarter based on timing of project execution and tag shipments, all in all, a solid outlook for the balance of the year. 
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $381 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 34.8% in the quarter. As usual, in this segment, we will profile the 3 macro parts, medical products, Neptune and our industrial businesses. To start, our medical product business has performed very well this quarter. Verathon continued its strength based on consistent factors, GlideScope unit placements and recurring consumables pull-through and continued momentum and share gains with our single-use bronchoscope product offering. What's also encouraging to see is the growth in their BladderScan product line. We believe this was based on a broader base trend of hospitals resuming some normal level of clinical capital spending. 
We saw similar strength in our other medical product businesses as well. For instance, Northern Digital, had their best Q1's bookings quarter in history. This trend bodes well for the balance of the year. Neptune, as expected, declined in the quarter for the same reasons discussed in each of the last 3 quarters, having limited access to indoor meters in the Northeast United States and Canada. However, we did see some easing of these restrictions in March, and Neptune's customers are beginning to increase their maintenance schedules throughout Q2 and and into the second half of the year.  Finally, our industrial business has benefited from improvements in their end market conditions. 
For the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit growth for the segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions, both in medical and industrial end markets and increases to access an indoor meter replacements at Neptune. This strength will be somewhat offset by the extraordinary prior year COVID demand at Verathon. We're encouraged by our expected high single-digit growth for the balance of the year. 
Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our Process Technologies segment were $131 million down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins hung in at 31% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after nearly 2 years of declines. For instance, at CCC, we are seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. 
Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is particularly partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected Pumping Solutions. As we look to the outlook for the balance of the year, we see double-digit organic growth based on improving end market conditions and continued easing comps. 
Now please turn to Page 14, where I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share. And organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range. This 6% to 7% organic growth is against a 1% organic decline in 2020. This demonstrates that we have meaningfully improved on an organic basis since 2019. The compounding continues.  Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. 
For the second quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 million, and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full year organic growth rate. 
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary, this was an encouraging start, and we're raising our outlook for the year. We performed well across virtually every financial metric with double-digit increases in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded nicely, and free cash flow grew 54% to $543 million, which enabled us to continue our rapid deleveraging in the quarter. Importantly, we are well positioned for continued double-digit compounding. 
We're seeing improving conditions across virtually all of our end markets. When combined with our leading market positions, we expect high single-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. As owners or prospective owners are Roper Tech, you should be encouraged by our increasing levels of recurring revenue and the stability of our recurring revenue growth. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions are performing very well, and Vertafore has proven to be an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of software businesses. 
We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of this year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. 
In closing, and as we turn to your questions, we recently announced that Amy Woods Brinkley will become our new board chair effective June 1. Amy has been a tremendous Board member since 2015 and will be a fantastic board chair. I certainly look forward to working with Amy and the full board for many years to come. 
But as we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our outgoing board chair, Bill Prezzano. Bill has been a Roper director since 1997 and has reached our mandatory Board retirement age. He served as our lead independent chair director and became board chair during the CEO transition from Brian Johnson to myself. Bill has been a wonderful board chair, enabling a smooth CEO transition and the continued evolution of our strategy and business model. On a personal note, Bill has been a tremendous mentor to me, which I hope will continue on an informal basis for years to come. Bill, thank you for your years of service to Roper shareholders. I think the share price is around $16 when you started, and thank you for helping me becoming a better leader and chief executive officer. 
With that, we'd like to open it up to your questions."

I think on a core basis, it's going to be relatively consistent year-over-year for the rest of the businesses on an EBITDA margin basis. And that's conversion at 40% to 50%. And that's just consistent with what we see in these businesses as they grow. And as you know, they have great cash characteristics, very negative working capital.

We talked about medical products. We got the COVID headwind for a quarter or 2 at Verathon, but the other businesses definitely saw a palpable improvement in the capital purchases of their medical equipment in the quarter. And we had no sense that was pent-up or onetime. We'll find out in the next quarter or 2, but that was not the read-through from the conversations we had with our customers. In fact, NDI had record bookings in the quarter. 
As we go through the industrial businesses, Struers, we definitely saw an improvement across the portfolio of industrial businesses through the quarter with Struers having record March bookings, which shows that there's some sort of gradual improvement there to continue. And then on the process technology businesses, there was just nice -- I would call that very similar to what we saw at Struers and Industrial. March got better than February, and February better than January."

So that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude, maybe a couple of turns, but it depends on what the magnitude of the tax change is. Relative to interest rates going up, we think that does greatly benefit us in the compounding model. If you think as interest rates go up, we're competing against private equity firms who have a levered acquisition model. So as interest rates go up, the amount of leverage they can put on a transaction goes down. And subsequently, the total equity that they put into a deal goes down and multiples compress more so with interest rates going up, I think, than what you see conversely of Texas. And then in our case, the majority of our acquisition proceeds come from our cash that we generate. And so we're relatively insensitive to interest rate where our competitors for acquisitions are.

The -- let me give you a broader view to the -- to your question. First, why we're active now with our M&A pipeline is that we -- we're meeting with companies is that every company of size that we bought from 2016 forward, we met with roughly 9 to 12 months at the earliest -- at a minimum before buying the company. So we're establishing a relationship, getting into the management team, getting to know the business. And then, sort of, if you will, have a a running start when the business actually comes for sale. So we're active. And the work we're doing now is going to pay dividends 9, 12, 18 months from now in terms of deploying capital and our ability to do that in companies that we have high level of conviction in. 
To your question about doing bigger and bigger deals, I would beg to differ with that a little bit. When you look at our model over the next 7 years, we have to deploy somewhere on a run rate basis $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year based on our cash flow and the leverage profile that we just talked about. And in doing so, when you're looking at the types of businesses that we look to buy, small market, vertically focused, leading software-type or software-type business models. I think the sweet spot in that is going to be somewhere in the $750 million to $1.5 billion range. So we're talking about doing a couple ish deals a year, and then we'll always do a small number of tuck-ins or bolt-ons to the existing portfolio. So I think we can -- at least for the next 7 years on a per-year basis, we don't have to do bigger and bigger deals to keep the growth rate at the sustained double-digit rate."

Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callahan, Vice President of Finance. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and our adjusted results consist of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue and related commission expense, and lastly, a gain on sale related to a minority investment in Cetero. 
And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?"

As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to your questions towards the end. 
Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we got off to a better start than we expected. Business execution was strong across the portfolio and was also broad based. We are encouraged by seeing nice improvements across the vast majority of our software and product based end markets. In addition, we continue to see accelerating software recurring revenue growth, growing approximately 6% on an organic basis.  Importantly, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions, led by Vertafore, continued to perform very well versus our expectations. When we put this all together, we experienced double-digit growth across virtually all financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. The growth and cash flow performance in the quarter allowed us to continue our rapid deleveraging with about $500 million in debt paydown during the quarter. Based on this encouraging start, we're increasing our outlook and guidance for the full year. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Rob to review the financial details. Rob?"

Turning to Page 6, and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last",330,"Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6, and covering the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last year's plus 4% pre pandemic comp.  EBITDA grew 20% to $561 million. EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 36.7% on really great incrementals across the portfolio. Adjusted debts was $3.60, 18% above prior year. Free cash flow was $543 million, up 54%. 
We continue to benefit from our business transformation to a more software weighted model where working capital boost cash flow as our growth accelerates. Our results were enhanced a bit by approximately $40 million of accelerated payments that were the result of wins at our U.K.-based Clinisys laboratory software business. Aided by our outstanding cash flow performance, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter, more on that to follow.  So in summary, a great start to 2021. 
Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update on our deleveraging. The charts on this page are a good preview for how we expect 2021 to look as we follow through on our commitment to reduce debt after our 2020 opportunistic capital deployment. As each quarter passes by, we will benefit from meaningfully improved trailing EBITDA as the performance of last year's acquisitions rolls into Roper's financials. EBITDA is then further enhanced by our accelerating organic growth. 
Concurrently, our strong cash conversion allows us to apply our high levels of excess free cash flow toward consistent reduction of our debt. In the first quarter, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million. Over the first 3 months of the year, our EBITDA growth, combined with debt reduction, enabled us to lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7 to 4.2. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance."
22751,710870368,2258805,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. As we turn to Page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is about 7",1810,"Thanks, Rob. As we turn to Page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter. 
Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 6%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Of note, this quarter should be the last quarter of nonrecurring revenue declines as we come across the COVID comp from last year. 
From a business unit perspective, Deltek continued its long string of great performance. As we expected, Deltek's recurring revenue grew nicely. Of particular importance, Deltek saw an increase to their perpetual revenue during the quarter coming off a decently strong quarter a year ago. Also encouraging was the nature of the bookings activity which was broad-based across our architecture, engineering, creative and government contracting end markets. For reference, the professional services end markets tied to AEC and creative have been slow since the onset of COVID. Also, CliniSys, our European lab software business just crushed it during the quarter. As Rob mentioned, CliniSys had exceptionally strong cash flow as they gained tremendous market share within the clinical lab consolidation occurring within the United Kingdom. CliniSys has approximately 85% market share in the U.K. and is now recognized as 1 of 4 critical IT vendors for the entire national health service, just outstanding execution by the CliniSys team, and congrats. 
We also saw thawing in the higher education markets that CBORD serves, certainly encouraging. Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continues to perform very well. Specific to Vertafore, we continue to be encouraged by their customers' comfort in having Roper as a long-term owner for the business. Also, Amy and her team have done a great job transitioning to Roper and our governance model. 
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on the expectation for sustained levels of recurring revenue growth and the resumption of nonrecurring revenue growth. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect our growth to be a touch below high single digits due to our global lab software group coming off across a challenging comp from a year ago as they are instrumental standing up COVID testing on a global basis, a solid and encouraging quarter for sure. 
And with that, let's turn to our next slide, please. Turning to Page 10, revenue in our network segment were $440 million, flat versus last year and down 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 40.9% in the quarter. Our software businesses in the segment, about 65% of the revenues, were up 4% on an organic basis. This revenue was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 6%. Recurring revenue growth is underpinned by strong customer retention. Recurring revenues are also benefited by increasing network participation. 
At the business level, our freight match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada continued to be solid growers for us. As a reminder, our freight match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking-shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers. We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. 
And lastly, as it relates to our network software businesses, we saw improved end market activity, especially in the middle market for foundry, our media and entertainment compositing software business. 
Our non software businesses in this segment were down 13% for the quarter, a touch better than we anticipated. TransCore's New York project work continues and is tracking well. TransCore's tag volumes declined versus a year ago based on lower traffic volumes across the U.S. 
Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment with consistent high single-digit growth through the balance of the year for our network software businesses. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we anticipate our segment organic growth to be a touch below HSD given TransCore should be stronger in the second half versus next quarter based on timing of project execution and tag shipments, all in all, a solid outlook for the balance of the year. 
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $381 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 34.8% in the quarter. As usual, in this segment, we will profile the 3 macro parts, medical products, Neptune and our industrial businesses. To start, our medical product business has performed very well this quarter. Verathon continued its strength based on consistent factors, GlideScope unit placements and recurring consumables pull-through and continued momentum and share gains with our single-use bronchoscope product offering. What's also encouraging to see is the growth in their BladderScan product line. We believe this was based on a broader base trend of hospitals resuming some normal level of clinical capital spending. 
We saw similar strength in our other medical product businesses as well. For instance, Northern Digital, had their best Q1's bookings quarter in history. This trend bodes well for the balance of the year. Neptune, as expected, declined in the quarter for the same reasons discussed in each of the last 3 quarters, having limited access to indoor meters in the Northeast United States and Canada. However, we did see some easing of these restrictions in March, and Neptune's customers are beginning to increase their maintenance schedules throughout Q2 and and into the second half of the year.  Finally, our industrial business has benefited from improvements in their end market conditions. 
For the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit growth for the segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions, both in medical and industrial end markets and increases to access an indoor meter replacements at Neptune. This strength will be somewhat offset by the extraordinary prior year COVID demand at Verathon. We're encouraged by our expected high single-digit growth for the balance of the year. 
Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our Process Technologies segment were $131 million down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins hung in at 31% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after nearly 2 years of declines. For instance, at CCC, we are seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. 
Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is particularly partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected Pumping Solutions. As we look to the outlook for the balance of the year, we see double-digit organic growth based on improving end market conditions and continued easing comps. 
Now please turn to Page 14, where I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share. And organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range. This 6% to 7% organic growth is against a 1% organic decline in 2020. This demonstrates that we have meaningfully improved on an organic basis since 2019. The compounding continues.  Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. 
For the second quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 million, and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full year organic growth rate. 
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary, this was an encouraging start, and we're raising our outlook for the year. We performed well across virtually every financial metric with double-digit increases in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded nicely, and free cash flow grew 54% to $543 million, which enabled us to continue our rapid deleveraging in the quarter. Importantly, we are well positioned for continued double-digit compounding. 
We're seeing improving conditions across virtually all of our end markets. When combined with our leading market positions, we expect high single-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. As owners or prospective owners are Roper Tech, you should be encouraged by our increasing levels of recurring revenue and the stability of our recurring revenue growth. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions are performing very well, and Vertafore has proven to be an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of software businesses. 
We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of this year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. 
In closing, and as we turn to your questions, we recently announced that Amy Woods Brinkley will become our new board chair effective June 1. Amy has been a tremendous Board member since 2015 and will be a fantastic board chair. I certainly look forward to working with Amy and the full board for many years to come. 
But as we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our outgoing board chair, Bill Prezzano. Bill has been a Roper director since 1997 and has reached our mandatory Board retirement age. He served as our lead independent chair director and became board chair during the CEO transition from Brian Johnson to myself. Bill has been a wonderful board chair, enabling a smooth CEO transition and the continued evolution of our strategy and business model. On a personal note, Bill has been a tremendous mentor to me, which I hope will continue on an informal basis for years to come. Bill, thank you for your years of service to Roper shareholders. I think the share price is around $16 when you started, and thank you for helping me becoming a better leader and chief executive officer. 
With that, we'd like to open it up to your questions."

On an EBITDA margin basis, right, I mean, Vertafore is a higher EBITDA margin business. So that, you're seeing that, and we talked about -- we bought the business, it's around 50% or so, a little below that EBITDA margin business. So that helps. 
I think on a core basis, it's going to be relatively consistent year-over-year for the rest of the businesses on an EBITDA margin basis. And that's conversion at 40% to 50%. And that's just consistent with what we see in these businesses as they grow. And as you know, they have great cash characteristics, very negative working capital. So the cash flow growth can often be even faster than the EBITDA growth. 
And so it's a great story there, and I think we'll continue to see margins high to that segment."

So that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude, maybe a couple of turns, but it depends on what the magnitude of the tax change is. Relative to interest rates going up, we think that does greatly benefit us in the compounding model. If you think as interest rates go up, we're competing against private equity firms who have a levered acquisition model. So as interest rates go up, the amount of leverage they can put on a transaction goes down. And subsequently, the total equity that they put into a deal goes down and multiples compress more so with interest rates going up, I think, than what you see conversely of Texas. And then in our case, the majority of our acquisition proceeds come from our cash that we generate. And so we're relatively insensitive to interest rate where our competitors for acquisitions are.

When you look at our model over the next 7 years, we have to deploy somewhere on a run rate basis $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year based on our cash flow and the leverage profile that we just talked about. And in doing so, when you're looking at the types of businesses that we look to buy, small market, vertically focused, leading software-type or software-type business models. I think the sweet spot in that is going to be somewhere in the $750 million to $1.5 billion range. So we're talking about doing a couple ish deals a year, and then we'll always do a small number of tuck-ins or bolt-ons to the existing portfolio. So I think we can -- at least for the next 7 years on a per-year basis, we don't have to do bigger and bigger deals to keep the growth rate at the sustained double-digit rate."

As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to your questions towards the end. 
Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we got off to a better start than we expected. Business execution was strong across the portfolio and was also broad based. We are encouraged by seeing nice improvements across the vast majority of our software and product-based end markets. In addition, we continue to see accelerating software recurring revenue growth, growing approximately 6% on an organic basis. Importantly, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions led by Vertafore continued to perform very well versus our expectations. 
When you put this altogether, we experienced double-digit growth across virtually all financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. The growth in cash flow performance in the quarter allowed to continue our rapid leveraging with about $500 million in debt paydown during the quarter. Based on this encouraging start, we're increasing our outlook and guidance for the full year.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Rob to review the financial details. Rob?"

Total revenue increased 13% to $1.53 billion, which was an all-time record for any Roper quarter. Organic revenue for the enterprise declined 1% versus last year's plus 4% prepandemic comp. EBITDA grew 20% to $561 million. EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 36.7% on really great incrementals across the portfolio. Adjusted DEPS was $3.60, 18% above prior year. Free cash flow was $543 million, up 54%. We continue to benefit from our business transformation to a more software-weighted model, where working capital boosts cash flow as our growth accelerates. 
Our results were enhanced a bit by approximately $40 million of accelerated payments that were the result of wins at our U.K.-based CliniSys laboratory software business. 
Aided by our outstanding cash flow performance, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million in the quarter. More on that to follow. So in summary, a great start to 2021.  
Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update on our deleveraging. 
The charts on this page are a good preview for how we expect 2021 to look as we follow through on our commitment to reduce debt after our 2020 opportunistic capital deployment. As each quarter passes by, we will benefit from meaningfully improved trailing EBITDA as the performance of last year's acquisitions rolls into Roper's financials. EBITDA is then further enhanced by our accelerating organic growth.  
Concurrently, our strong cash conversion allows us to apply our high levels of excess free cash flow toward consistent reduction of our debt. In the first quarter, we reduced our debt by approximately $500 million. Over the first 3 months of the year, our EBITDA growth, combined with debt reduction, enabled us to lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7 to 4.2. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward.  
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance."

As we turn to Page 9, revenues in our application software segment were $578 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were an impressive 44.9% in the quarter.  
Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 6%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Of note, this quarter should be the last quarter of nonrecurring revenue declines as we come across the COVID comp from last year.  
From a business unit perspective, Deltek continued its long string of great performance. As we expected, Deltek's recurring revenue grew nicely. Of particular importance, Deltek saw an increase to their perpetual revenue during the quarter, coming off a decently strong quarter a year ago. Also encouraging was the nature of the bookings activity, which was broad based across our architecture, engineering, creative and government contracting end markets. For reference, the professional services end markets tied to AEC and creative have been slow since the onset of COVID. 
Also, CliniSys, our European lab software business, just crushed it during the quarter. As Rob mentioned, CliniSys had exceptionally strong cash flow as they gained tremendous market share within the clinical lab consolidation occurring within the United Kingdom. CliniSys has approximately 85% market share in the U.K. and is now recognized as 1 of 4 critical IT vendors for the entire National Health Service, just outstanding execution by the CliniSys team, and congrats.  
We also saw thawing in the higher education markets that CBORD serves, certainly encouraging. 
Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continues to perform very well. Specific to Vertafore, we continue to be encouraged by their customers' comfort in having Roper as a long-term owner for the business. Also, Amy and her team have done a great job transitioning to Roper and our governance model.  
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on the expectation for sustained levels of recurring revenue growth and the resumption of nonrecurring revenue growth. 
As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect our growth to be a touch below high single digits due to our global lab software group coming off across a challenging comp from a year ago as they are instrumental standing up COVID testing on a global basis, a solid and encouraging quarter for sure.  
And with that, let's turn to our next slide, please. Turning to Page 10, revenue in our network segment were $440 million, flat versus last year and down 3% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 40.9% in the quarter. Our software businesses in the segment, about 65% of the revenues, were up 4% on an organic basis. This revenue was broad based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 6%. Recurring revenue growth is underpinned by strong customer retention. Recurring revenues are also benefited by increasing network participation.  
At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continued to be solid growers for us. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking/shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers. 
We also continued to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner.  
And lastly, as it relates to our network software businesses, we saw improved end market activity, especially in the middle market, for Foundry, our media and entertainment compositing software business.  
Our nonsoftware businesses in this segment were down 13% for the quarter, a touch better than we anticipated. TransCore's New York project work continues and is tracking well. TransCore's tag volumes declined versus a year ago based on lower traffic volumes across the U.S.  
Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment, with consistent high single-digit growth through the balance of the year for our network software businesses. 
As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we anticipate our segment organic growth to be a touch below HSD given TransCore should be stronger in the second half versus next quarter based on timing of project execution and tag shipments. All in all, a solid outlook for the balance of the year.  
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $381 million, up 2% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 34.8% in the quarter. 
As usual, in this segment, we will profile the 3 macro parts, medical products, Neptune and our industrial businesses. To start, our medical product business has performed very well this quarter. Verathon continued its strength based on consistent factors: GlideScope unit placements and recurring consumables pull-through and continued momentum and share gains with our single-use bronchoscope product offering. What's also encouraging to see is the growth in their BladderScan product line. We believe this was based on a broader-based trend of hospitals resuming some normal level of clinical capital spending.  
We saw similar strength in our other medical product businesses as well. For instance, Northern Digital, had their best Q1's bookings quarter in history. This trend bodes well for the balance of the year. Neptune, as expected, declined in the quarter for the same reasons discussed in each of the last 3 quarters, having limited access to indoor meters in the Northeast United States and Canada. However, we did see some easing of these restrictions in March, and Neptune's customers are beginning to increase their maintenance schedules throughout Q2 and into the second half of the year. 
Finally, our industrial businesses benefited from improvements in their end market conditions.  
For the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions, both in medical and industrial end markets, and increases to access and indoor meter replacements at Neptune. This strength will be somewhat offset by the extraordinary prior year COVID demand at Verathon. We're encouraged by our expected high single-digit growth for the balance of the year.  
Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our Process Technologies segment were $131 million, down 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins hung in at 31% in the quarter. 
The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after nearly 2 years of declines. For instance, at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis.  
Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is particularly partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions.  
As we look to the outlook for the balance of the year, we see double-digit organic growth based on improving end market conditions and continued easing comps.  
Now please turn to Page 14, where I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. 
Based on strong Q1 performance and our increased confidence for the balance of the year, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $14.75 and $15 per share and organic growth to be in the 6% to 7% range. This 6% to 7% organic growth is against a 1% organic decline in 2020. This demonstrates that we have meaningfully improved on an organic basis since 2019. The compounding continues.  
Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range.  
For the second quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.61 and $3.65 and expect second quarter organic revenue growth to be in line with the full year organic growth rate.  
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. 
Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary, this was an encouraging start, and we're raising our outlook for the year. We performed well across virtually every financial metric with double-digit increases in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded nicely, and free cash flow grew 54% to $543 million, which enabled us to continue our rapid deleveraging in the quarter. Importantly, we are well positioned for continued double-digit compounding.  
We're seeing improving conditions across virtually all of our end markets. When combined with our leading market positions, we expect high single-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. 
As owners or prospective owners of Roper Tech, you should be encouraged by our increasing levels of recurring revenue and the stability of our recurring revenue growth. Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions are performing very well, and Vertafore has proven to be an excellent addition to our growing portfolio of software businesses.  
We continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and remain committed and focused on our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of this year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner.  
In closing, and as we turn to your questions, we recently announced that Amy Woods Brinkley will become our new Board Chair effective June 1. Amy has been a tremendous Board member since 2015 and will be a fantastic Board Chair. I certainly look forward to working with Amy and the full Board for many years to come.  
But as we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our outgoing board chair, Bill Prezzano. Bill has been a Roper director since 1997 and has reached our mandatory Board retirement age. He served as our Lead Independent Chair Director and became Board Chair during the CEO transition from Brian Jellison to myself. 
Bill has been a wonderful Board Chair, enabling a smooth CEO transition and the continued evolution of our strategy and business model. On a personal note, Bill has been a tremendous mentor to me, which I hope will continue on an informal basis for years to come. Bill, thank you for your years of service to Roper shareholders. I think the share price is around $16 when you started. And thank you for helping me become a better leader and Chief Executive Officer.  
With that, we'd like to open it up to your questions."

Maybe a couple of turns, but it depends on what the magnitude of the tax change is. 
Relative to interest rates going up, we think that does greatly benefit us in the compounding model. If you think as interest rates go up, we're competing against private equity firms who have a levered acquisition model. So as interest rates go up, the amount of leverage they can put on a transaction goes down. And subsequently, the total equity that they put into a deal goes down and multiples compress more so with interest rates going up, I think, than what you see conversely with taxes. 
And then in our case, the majority of our acquisition proceeds come from our cash that we generate. And so we're relatively insensitive to interest rate where our competitors for acquisitions are. So in the long arc of time, that's a good thing for us."

I wanted to ask about the backlog of opportunities that you mentioned that you might get back to accessing it at the end of the year as you start to deploy capital. Could you just say a little more on the nature of that pipeline, the size of the companies in there?

The -- let me give you a broader view to the -- to your question. First, why we're active now with our M&A pipeline is that we -- and we're meeting with companies is that every company of size that we bought from 2016 forward, we met with roughly 9 to 12 months at the earliest -- at a minimum before buying the company. So we're establishing a relationship, getting to know the management team, getting to know the business, and then sort of, if you will, have a running start when the business actually comes for sale. So we're active. And the work we're doing now is going to pay dividends 9, 12, 18 months from now in terms of deploying capital and our ability to do that in companies that we have a high level of conviction in. 
To your question about doing bigger and bigger deals, I would beg to differ with that a little bit. When you look at our model over the next 7 years, we have to deploy somewhere, on a run rate basis, $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year based on our cash flow and the leverage profile that we just talked about. And in doing so, when you're looking at the types of businesses that we look to buy, small market, vertically focused, leading software-type or software-type business models, I think the sweet spot in that is going to be somewhere in the $750 million to $1.5 billion range. So we're talking about doing a couple-ish deals a year, and then we'll always do a small number of tuck-ins or bolt-ons to the existing portfolio. So I think we can -- at least for the next 7 years on a per-year basis, we don't have to do bigger and bigger deals to keep the growth rate at the sustained double-digit rate."

As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk through all your questions towards the end. 
Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we delivered an excellent second quarter with strength across all 4 of our segments. Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow all grew north of 20% in the quarter. 
Also during the quarter, we are encouraged to see the post-pandemic recovery gain momentum and broaden at the same time. Specifically, not only did we experience continued improvement across virtually all of our businesses, the strength within each business was broad. 
Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base performed very well in the quarter. Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%. Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our software revenues, from mid single to high singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity. 
Relative to our product businesses, a very similar pattern: acceleration and recovery of our consumables revenue sources and very nice ordering patterns for our capital equipment type products. In addition, our 2020 acquisition cohort led by Vertafore is performing very well. 
Importantly and consistent with our guidance over the last 3 quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace, now under 4x debt to EBITDA. 
And finally, before handing things over to Rob, just a great first half to the year. Our teams have performed magnificently, thanks to each and every team member at Roper. Given the great start and the positive momentum across our enterprise, we are once again increasing our full year guidance. 
Rob, let me hand it over to you."

Turning to Page 6, looking at some of the key financial highlights for Q2. Total revenue increased 22% to $1.59 billion, another record for any Roper quarter. Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3%. All 4 segments performed well, with strong organic growth across our portfolio of software and product businesses. 
Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million, and EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points to 36.4%. 
Adjusted DEPS was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65. 
Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year. As a reminder, last year, we adjusted our Q2 cash flow to account for the income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to 2020 delayed tax deadlines. 
Net working capital was negative 8%. We continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash [indiscernible].
Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment, and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2. 
So in summary, an excellent second quarter, wrapping up a very strong first half for Roper. 
Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update to the charge we introduced last quarter showing our rapid deleveraging. Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion since completing the 2020 acquisition late last year. Our debt reduction, along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisition, has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 4.7% to 3.8% in only 6 months. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward, which positions us well for a meaningful capital deployment in the coming quarters. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance."

Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis. As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year, aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response. EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter. 
Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, new product cross-selling activity and new customer adds. To that end, the nonrecurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well. 
Specific to business unit performance, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end market had an excellent quarter. Their strength was rooted in large-scale GovCon customer wins and expansion activity. Deltek was further benefited by the recovery in the professional services end market. Terrific job by Mike and the entire team at Deltek. 
Aderant, our legal software business, continues its momentum and market share gains. In addition, and encouragingly, their customers are beginning the journey of migrating to Aderant's cloud solutions. This will take many years for the entire customer base to migrate, but will result in increased customer intimacy and higher levels of recurring revenue. 
CliniSys and Data Innovations continued their long string of market share gains in the quarter. And CBORD grew based on strength in health care and, in particular, their higher education product offerings. 
Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well, both at Vertafore and EPSi.
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment based on strength in both our recurring and nonrecurring revenue streams. A solid quarter here for sure. 
And with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in our Network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter. 
Our software businesses in this segment, about 65% of the revenues, were up 10% on an organic basis. This growth was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%. 
At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize, interact and transact the trucking shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, but with particular strength in this quarter on the carrier side of the network. 
We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as our network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. 
Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, recovered nicely in the quarter with particular strength in the mid-market. 
Importantly, we continue to see very strong customer retention levels across each and every one of our network software businesses. 
The strong growth in our software businesses was partially offset by project delays in our TransCore New York congestion pricing project. These delays are based on pending federal environmental approvals. While we all believe the federal approval will be granted, the approval process to complete our work is taking longer than originally anticipated. Conversely, TransCore demand appears to be normalizing for the balance of the year. 
As we look to our second half outlook, we expect to see high single-digit growth in this segment. The growth to be underpinned by strength in our network software businesses, which we expect to grow in the low double-digit range in the second half of the year. 
Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this project's revenue to push out of the second half of the year and into 2022. 
All in all, high single-digit organic increases in this segment for the balance of the year. 
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $397 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was north of 20%. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.4% in the quarter. 
Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of innovation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon continues to experience impressive growth within their bronchoscope product family and the recovery in their BladderScan ultrasound product group. 
EBITDA margins in the segment were lower due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the associated margin benefit. 
Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter based on hospitals and hospital equipment OEMs resuming normal levels of activity. 
Demand at Neptune was very strong as well. The Northeast opened up and the balance of the country experienced normalizing levels of activity. 
Our industrial businesses were strong. As I mentioned in the opening, the strength was buoyed by improving consumables activity and solid returns to capital equipment spending. Our businesses within this segment have done a nice job navigating the difficult supply environment. In supply environments like the one we are in right now, our decentralized, highly nimble organization tends to perform quite well. This quarter was no exception. 
For the balance of the year, we expect double-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. n
Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our Process Tech segment were $140 million, up 13% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins improved by over 500 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after over nearly 2 years of declines. 
Our upstream oil and gas business has started to recover nicely. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. And finally, at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and the demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. 
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect 20% plus organic growth based on improving market conditions and continued easing comps. 
Now please turn to Page 14, and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong first half performance, improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share. Of note, our prior high-end depth guidance was $15, now the bottom end of our range. Also, we're increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing. 
Our full year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher. This full year growth outlook implies low double-digit organic growth in the second half. 
Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. 
For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84. 
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary. This is a very strong quarter for our enterprise with softer revenues growing on an organic basis, 9% in our Application Software segment and 10% for our software businesses in our NSS segment. In addition, the recovery pattern is characterized as gaining momentum and being broad, strength in product and software, strength in recurring and nonrecurring. 
We performed very well virtually every financial metric, growing 20% plus in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points and free cash flow increased 34% to $409 million in the quarter. As promised, we continue to delever our balance sheet, reducing debt by $375 million in the quarter and by $1.4 billion since completing our 2020 acquisitions in Q4 of last year. 
As we look forward, positive momentum continues to build. Over the last decade, we have worked to improve the quality of our portfolio to be more software-based, resulting in enterprise having higher levels of recurring revenue and be increasingly asset-light. 
In addition to having this improved quality within our business portfolio, we're seeing our recurring revenue growth rates improve from mid singles to high singles. 
Finally, our businesses will benefit from improving end market conditions. 
Given each of these, improved portfolio quality, improving recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we expect to see double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. 
Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well and solidly contribute to, and improve the quality of, our enterprise. Given all of these factors, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. 
Finally, while we continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, we also remain committed to our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of the year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. And with that, let's turn to your questions."

And again, just to echo what Rob said, the margin pressure there is just Verathon was amazing last year and they were deleveraged, as you expect, this year. 
In terms of the capacity there, the company is perfectly fine. I mean they ramped up last year in a way that was unprecedented. And as we look back and just we're sort of amazed at how that company operation was able to do that. 
I would also just highlight for Verathon, it was -- the demand there was a little bit driven by ventilators, but a lot a bit by the anesthesiologists and the people who do the intubations wanting to do it at an arm's length away for general surgery as opposed to when you do a direct -- direct invasion, you have to visualize the vocal cords and you're right on top of the patient. Our product allows you to monitor and be arm's length. And so it's less the demand, it's less about the ventilators and more about just a better, more effective way to do an intubation, so much so that the total percentage of intubations done now versus 2018 or '19, you think video assistance, we believe, is permanently meaningfully higher. So it should be a long-term tailwind for the business."

And I'll remind you that Vertafore, we met with Amy and the team 18 months before we ultimately bought the company. And so we do a lot of early spade work, understanding the businesses, understanding the management teams and tracking.

I think the success here at Aderant is a combination of a great leadership team in a great market with a great product but also complemented by our [ government ] system that focuses over success -- over a long arc of time. 
So the share gain from our principal competitor, as you mentioned, has been happening for essentially since we've owned the business. There is just a couple of years of inventory left in terms of those large law firms that have yet to make a decision on their enterprise system between us and our primary competitor, but that's been a known issue for 3 or 4 years now. That inventory is going to run out in 2023, 2024. And so Aderant goes to work on their product offerings. They go to work on their cloud solutions. We've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in that business to where the -- if you will, the divot that existed in 2023 or 2024 relative to the growth rate 4 or 5 years ago. Now this no longer exists in any capacity, and we believe Aderant will grow -- easily grow through the divot because of the product portfolio, the cloud migration and really the long-term planning and execution of that team."

So the second half for organic recurring is strong, right? So the dynamic there is that in the middle of COVID, recurring was more, generally speaking, across our enterprise, mid-singles, it's ticking up to high singles. The reason for that is twofold. One is that you have more additions, product and customer additions today, both perpetual and SaaS related to drive recurring. But then also, you have our software businesses that were most negatively impacted by COVID now being -- coming out of the ditch. Think like in Application Software, think of CBORD for instance. So not only did they have good bookings performance in the quarter, but they saw a bit of a tick up in their transactional revenue stream in Q2.

So let's take the software recurring question. Other than what I just mentioned about the shorter-term dynamics of mid singles going to high singles on the recurring revenue base, the structural element that's underpinning this is migration to the cloud. So you think we have -- our network businesses are almost all cloud as it speaks today delivered in that manner. The application businesses, you have Deltek, it's on its journey. You have Aderant, it's just starting its journey. You have Power Plan, it's just starting its journey. At CBORD, they're just starting this journey. And we mentioned many times, it's our customers that are pacing this activity, not us. So this will take 5, 10 years to complete the migration, maybe longer. But as you do that, you're lifting customers that are paying you maintenance and getting them into the cloud are large installed base, and that's accretive, meaningfully accretive to the recurring revenue growth rate. 
Relative to Vertafore, I appreciate the question. Vertafore is just a rock-solid business. As we mentioned, when we bought it, it's 90-plus percent recurring in terms of its revenue stream. It's on track for -- against our models and our deal -- models and sort of our expectations. Q2 was a touch better than we thought. But all in all, I'll call it on track relative to financial performance. 
Specific to the company itself, Amy and her team, they've demonstrated a wonderful ability to land new large customers. I think we mentioned in Q4 of last year, maybe Q1, we've won the largest deal in the market since we've owned the company which is encouraging. The customer base really appreciates the steady hand of ownership of Roper as opposed to trading every 3 to 5 years of private equity.

So I can't speak with specificity to deals that we've done. But what I can speak to is what we're observing from other companies and other transactions that are happening. 
Here in the last quarter, certainly -- I won't time bound it. Since the beginning of the year, valuations for the assets that we looked at actually feel like they pulled back a touch. They've actually gotten a little bit better. Maybe moderate, maybe they're flat, maybe they're a little bit better, but they're certainly not increasing, which seems to be the case really since 2013 or '14. So that maybe that bodes well.

I think this is just the first in the United States. I think MTA in New York are sort of -- sort of carving out what this looks like and sort of setting an expectation for the other cities in the U.S. that will eventually follow suit.

There's value on both sides of the equation for sure. 
The big thing that's happening in the space is the brokers are becoming more tech-enabled, right? So how do you match and connect shipments with fewer and fewer calls and sort of complete automation straight through? A dynamic that's very similar to our business in the life insurance, very similar to Vertafore, conceptually. How do you tech-enable the agencies to do their job? And that's precisely the product road map that DAT is endeavoring, right? So you'll have the high end of folks that are going to do a lot of this on their own. And then you have the very long tail of thousands and thousands brokers that are going to run on our technology to do that. It's part of the reason why the strength is in the market today. It strengthened the business today. It's also what we believe will happen when you can organize the spot market in a more efficient way with less friction cost to match a load, then the spot market will compete very favorably against the contracted market, which is much larger. So we believe there'll be a permanent market share shift into the spot market which will further benefit our business, the brokers, et cetera.

Rob will then discuss our P&L performance and balance sheet metrics and then turn it back to me to review our segment details, our increased outlook for the year and our concluding comments. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk through all your questions towards the end.  
Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, we delivered an excellent second quarter with strength across all 4 of our segments. Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow all grew north of 20% in the quarter.  
Also during the quarter, we are encouraged to see the post-pandemic recovery gain momentum and broaden at the same time. Specifically, not only did we experience continued improvement across virtually all of our businesses, the strength within each business was broad.  
Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base performed very well in the quarter. Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%. Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our software revenues, from mid singles to high singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity.  
Relative to our product businesses, a very similar pattern: acceleration and recovery of our consumables revenue sources and very nice ordering patterns for our capital equipment-type products. In addition, our 2020 acquisition cohort led by Vertafore is performing very well.  Importantly and consistent with our guidance over the last 3 quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace, now under 4x debt to EBITDA.  
And finally, before handing things over to Rob, just a great first half to the year. Our teams have performed magnificently, thanks to each and every team member at Roper. Given the great start and the positive momentum across our enterprise, we are once again increasing our full year guidance.  
Rob, let me hand it over to you."

Turning to Page 6, looking at some of the key financial highlights for Q2. Total revenue increased 22% $1.59 billion, another record for any Roper quarter. Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3%. All 4 segments performed well, with strong organic growth across our portfolio of software and product businesses.  
Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million, and EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points to 36.4%.  Adjusted DEPS was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65.  
Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year. As a reminder, last year, we adjusted our Q2 cash flow to account for the income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to 2020 delayed tax deadlines.  
Net working capital was negative 8%. We continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash conversion.
Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment, and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2.  So in summary, an excellent second quarter, wrapping up a very strong first half for Roper.  
Next slide. Turning to Page 7, an update to the charge we introduced last quarter showing our rapid deleveraging. Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion since completing the 2020 acquisition late last year. Our debt reduction, along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisitions, has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, from 4.7 to 3.8 in only 6 months. We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward, which positions us well for a return to meaningful capital deployment in the coming quarters.  
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to discuss our segment performance."

Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis. As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year, aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response. EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter.  
Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, new product cross-selling activity and new customer adds. To that end, the nonrecurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well.  
Specific to business unit performance, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end market had an excellent quarter. Their strength was rooted in large-scale GovCon customer wins and expansion activity. Deltek was further benefited by the recovery in the professional services end market. Terrific job by Mike and the entire team at Deltek.  
Aderant, our legal software business, continues its momentum and market share gains. In addition, and encouragingly, their customers are beginning the journey of migrating to Aderant's cloud solutions. This will take many years for the entire customer base to migrate, but will result in increased customer intimacy and higher levels of recurring revenue.  
CliniSys and Data Innovations continued their long string of market share gains in the quarter. And CBORD grew based on strength in health care and, in particular, their higher education product offerings.  Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well, both at Vertafore and EPSi. 
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment based on strength in both our recurring and nonrecurring revenue streams. A solid quarter here for sure.  
And with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 10. Revenues in our Network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter.  
Our software businesses in this segment, about 65% of the revenues, were up 10% on an organic basis. This growth was broad based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%.  
At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize, interact and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, but with particular strength in this quarter on the carrier side of the network.  We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as our network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner.  
Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, recovered nicely in the quarter with particular strength in the mid-market.  Importantly, we continue to see very strong customer retention levels across each and every one of our network software businesses.  
The strong growth in our software businesses was partially offset by project delays in our TransCore New York congestion pricing project. These delays are based on pending federal environmental approvals. While we all believe the federal approval will be granted, the approval process to complete our work is taking longer than originally anticipated. Conversely, TransCore tag demand appears to be normalizing for the balance of the year.  
As we look to our second half outlook, we expect to see high single-digit growth in this segment: the growth to be underpinned by strength in our network software businesses, which we expect to grow in the low double-digit range in the second half of the year.  Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this project's revenue to push out of the second half of the year and into 2022.  All in all, high single-digit organic increases in this segment for the balance of the year.  
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $397 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was north of 20%. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.4% in the quarter.  
Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon continues to experience impressive growth within their bronchoscope product family and the recovery in their BladderScan ultrasound product group. EBITDA margins in the segment were lower due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the associated margin benefit.  
Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter based on hospitals and hospital equipment OEMs resuming normal levels of activity.  Demand at Neptune was very strong as well. The Northeast opened up and the balance of the country experienced normalizing levels of activity.  
Our industrial businesses were strong. As I mentioned in the opening, the strength was buoyed by improving consumables activity and solid returns to capital equipment spending. Our businesses within this segment have done a nice job navigating the difficult supply environment. In supply environments like the one we are in right now, our decentralized, highly nimble organization tends to perform quite well. This quarter was no exception.  
For the balance of the year, we expect double-digit growth for this segment. This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. 
Now let's turn to our final segment, process tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our process tech segment were $140 million, up 13% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins improved by over 500 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after over nearly 2 years of declines.  
Our upstream oil and gas business has started to recover nicely. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT-connected pumping solutions. And finally at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and the demand for field services to come back online. Also, greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis.  
As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect 20%-plus organic growth based on improving market conditions and continued easing comps.  
Now please turn to Page 14, and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. Based on strong first half performance, improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share. Of note, our prior high-end DEPS guidance was $15, now the bottom end of our range. Also, we're increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing.  
Our full year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher. This full year growth outlook implies low double-digit organic growth in the second half.  Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range.  For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84.  
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Turning to Page 15 and our closing summary. This is a very strong quarter for our enterprise with software revenues growing on an organic basis, 9% in our Application Software segment and 10% for our software businesses in our NSS segment. In addition, the recovery pattern is characterized as gaining momentum and being broad, strength in product and software, strength in recurring and nonrecurring. We performed very well virtually every financial metric, growing 20% plus in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points and free cash flow increased 30% to $409 million in the quarter. As promised, we continue to delever our balance sheet, reducing debt by $375 million in the quarter and by $1.4 billion since completing our 2020 acquisitions in Q4 of last year.  
As we look forward, positive momentum continues to build. Over the last decade, we have worked to improve the quality of our portfolio to be more software based, resulting in enterprise having higher levels of recurring revenue and be increasingly asset-light.  In addition to having this improved quality within our business portfolio, we're seeing our recurring revenue growth rates improve from mid singles to high singles.  Finally, our businesses will benefit from improving end market conditions.  
Given each of these: improved portfolio quality, improving recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we expect to see double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year.  Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well and solidly contribute to, and improve the quality of, our enterprise. Given all of these factors, we're increasing our outlook for the full year.  
Finally, while we continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, we also remain committed to our long-term capital deployment strategy. To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. As our balance sheet becomes more offensive towards the end of the year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment in our usual process-oriented and disciplined manner. And with that, let's turn to your questions."

And again, just to echo what Rob said, the margin pressure there is just Verathon was amazing last year and they were deleveraged, as you expected, this year.  
In terms of the capacity there, the company is perfectly fine. I mean they ramped up last year in a way that was unprecedented. And as we look back and just we're sort of amazed at how that company operation was able to do that.  
I would also just highlight for Verathon, it was -- the demand there was a little bit driven by ventilators, but a lot a bit by the anesthesiologists and the people who do the intubations wanting to do it at an arm's length away for general surgery as opposed to when you do a direct intubation, you have to visualize the vocal cords right on top of the patient. Our product allows you to do it,  if you monitor and be arm's length. And so it's less, the demand, it's less about the ventilators and more about just a better, more effective way to do an intubation, so much so that the total percentage of intubations done now versus 2018 or '19,  using video assistance, we believe, is permanently meaningfully higher. So it should be a long-term tailwind for the business."

I would remind you and everybody that we do a lot of work well ahead of when assets are actually for sale. And I'll remind you that Vertafore, we met with Amy and the team 18 months before we ultimately bought the company. And so we do a lot of early spade work, understanding the businesses, understanding the management teams and tracking. And that's the activity we've done this year to sort of position us for late this year and into next year deploying capital."

I think the success here at Aderant is a combination of a great leadership team in a great market with a great product but also complemented by our government system that focuses over success -- over a long [ market ] time. 
So the share gain from our principal competitor, as you mentioned, has been happening for essentially since we've owned the business. There is just a couple of years of inventory left in terms of those large law firms that have yet to make a decision on their enterprise system between us and our primary competitor, but that's been a known issue for 3 or 4 years now. That inventory is going to run out in 2023, 2024. And so Aderant goes to work on their product offerings. They go to work on their cloud solutions. We've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in that business to where the -- if you will, the divot that existed in 2023 or 2024 relative to the growth rate 4 or 5 years ago. Now this no longer exists in any capacity, and we believe Aderant will grow -- easily grow through the divot because of the product portfolio, the cloud migration and really the long-term planning and execution of that team."

So the second half for organic recurring is strong, right? So the dynamic there is that in the middle of COVID, recurring was more, generally speaking, across our enterprise, mid singles, it's ticking up to high singles. The reason for that is twofold. One is that you have more additions, product and customer additions today, both perpetual and SaaS related that drive the recurring. But then also, you have our software businesses that were most negatively impacted by COVID now being coming out of the ditch. Think of like in Application Software, think of CBORD for instance. So not only did they have good bookings performance in the quarter, but they saw a bit of a tick up in their transactional revenue stream in Q2.

So let's take the software recurring question. Other than what I just mentioned about the shorter-term dynamics of mid singles going to high singles on the recurring revenue base, the structural element that's underpinning this is migration to the cloud. So you think we have -- our network businesses are almost all cloud as it speaks today delivered in that manner. The application businesses, you have Deltek, it's on its journey. You have Aderant, it's just starting its journey. You have PowerPlan, it's just starting its journey. At CBORD, it's just starting its journey. And we mentioned many times, it's our customers that are pacing this activity, not us. So this will take 5, 10 years to complete the migration, maybe longer. But as you do that, you're lifting customers that are paying you maintenance and getting them into the cloud are large installed base, and that's accretive, meaningfully accretive to the recurring revenue growth rate. 
Relative to Vertafore, I appreciate the question. Vertafore is just a rock-solid business. As we mentioned, when we bought it, it's 90-plus percent recurring in terms of its revenue stream. It's on track for -- against our models and our deal -- models and sort of our expectations. Q2 was a touch better than we thought. But all in all, I'll call it on track relative to financial performance. 
Specific to the company itself, Amy and her team, they've demonstrated a wonderful ability to land new large customers. I think we mentioned in Q4 of last year, maybe Q1, we've won the largest deal in the market since we've owned the company which is encouraging. The customer base really appreciates the steady hand of ownership of Roper as opposed to trading every 3 to 5 years of private equity.

Here in the last quarter, certainly -- I won't time bound it. Since the beginning of the year, valuations for the assets that we looked at actually feel like they pulled back a touch. They've actually gotten a little bit better. Maybe moderate, maybe they're flat, maybe they're a little bit better, but they're certainly not increasing, which seems to be the case really since 2013 or '14. So that maybe that bodes well.

I think this is just the first in the United States. I think MTA in New York are sort of carving out what this looks like and sort of setting an expectation for the other cities in the U.S. that will eventually follow suit.

There's value on both sides of the equation for sure. 
The big thing that's happening in the space is the brokers are becoming more tech-enabled, right? So how do you match and connect shipments with fewer and fewer calls and sort of complete automation straight through? A dynamic that's very similar to our business in the life insurance, very similar to Vertafore, conceptually. How do you tech-enable the agencies to do their job? And that's precisely the product road map that DAT is endeavoring, right? So you'll have the high end of folks that are going to do a lot of this on their own. And then you have the very long tail of thousands and thousands brokers that are going to run on our technology to do that. 
It's part of the reason why the strength is in the market today. It strengthened the business today. It's also what we believe will happen when you can organize the spot market in a more efficient way with less friction cost to match a load, then the spot market will compete very favorably against the contracted market, which is much larger. So we believe there'll be a permanent market share shift into the spot market which will further benefit our business, the brokers, et cetera.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During and subsequent to the third quarter, Roper signed definitive agreements to divest its TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the numbers shown in this presentation are on a continuing operations basis. 
For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; and lastly, income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.

We're looking forward to sharing with you the details of our solid quarter performance as well as summarizing the acceleration of our portfolio transformation. As we look at the sequence of our call this morning, we'll start with our quarterly highlights and our recent divestiture activity. I'll then turn the call over to Rob, who will share the details of our financial performance and our bridge to continued operations. I'll then walk everyone through our segment-by-segment performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. As usual, there will be plenty of time to talk to you all of your questions towards the end. 
Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, this was another quarter of solid operational and excellent financial performance. On a continuing ops basis, we grew revenue, EBITDA and debts north of 20% in the quarter. It's important to highlight and characterize the underlying strength of these results. Revenue on an organic basis grew 12% in the quarter. End market and customer demand was very strong across our portfolio, within both our software and product businesses. Importantly, our software segments were strong operationally with 10% growth in one segment and 17% in the other. Our software businesses recurring revenue grew low double digits in the quarter, highlighting the underlying strength, stability and increasing quality of our revenue base. To remind everyone, about 80% of our software revenues are recurring in nature. It's also worth noting that our 2020 acquisition cohort, led by Vertafore, continues to perform very well. 
As it relates to our product businesses, like most other companies, we are experiencing supply chain and logistical challenges, but the businesses, nevertheless, performed very well during the third quarter. As mentioned, customer demand was very strong throughout the quarter and backlogs are up over 50% versus last year. Given the strong operational performance, we continued our disciplined deleveraging of our balance sheet with net debt at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. Also, we are improving the outlook for the year, which we'll detail later in the call. 
Earlier this morning, we announced 2 new additions to our Board of Directors, Irene Esteves and Tom Joyce. The addition of Irene and Tom to our Board is part of our long-term Board refreshment process. Both are tremendous additions to our Board. 
Finally, we've been active over the last few months working to accelerate the transformation of our portfolio through the announced divestiture of 3 businesses. Let's turn to the next slide, Page 6, to walk through those details and highlights. Next slide, please. 
During the last several weeks, we entered into definitive agreements to divest 3 of our businesses. TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy, the last of which we announced this morning. We agreed to divest TransCore to ST Engineering for $2.68 billion. In our view, this is the right time and the right buyer for TransCore given their forward strategy and growth outlook. Taken together, we are divesting these 3 businesses for $3.15 billion or about 20x this year's EBITDA. Following the completion of these deals, Roper will be improved. We will have a higher quality portfolio characterized by having higher proportions of recurring revenue, a higher organic growth profile and be significantly more asset-light. 
Finally, we are and will be very active in deploying these after-tax proceeds. Together with our internally generated cash flow, we will have about $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy between now and the end of 2022, none of which is included in our current financial outlook. Our enterprise will be even further enhanced once we complete this activity. 
Before I turn it over to Rob, I wanted to take a moment and highlight Roper's ability to govern, build and improve businesses over the long term. As part of these transactions, we are retaining our DAT and Loadlink network software businesses, which are purchased together with TransCore and Tusan 4, and we are retaining our CIVCO Medical Solutions business. Given we do not usually get clean bookings to transaction activity, this provides a unique opportunity to talk about the business building that occurs within Roper. 
Specifically, just after the acquisition of TransCore, we established DAT and Loadlink as stand-alone businesses with independent strategies and management teams who operate within Roper's governance and incentive system. Over the course of the last 15 years, these businesses have consolidated freight networks, continuously innovate their product solutions, built go-to-market capability and grown revenues high single digits on a compounded organic basis. 
Similarly, the retained CIVCO Medical Solutions business has grown high single digits on an organic basis over the last 15 years as well. During this period of time, CIVCO Medical Solutions has continually innovated their product solutions, including the recent gel-free ultrasound products and fundamentally restructured their go-to-market strategy. At Roper, we buy great businesses and provide an environment and incentive system where they get even better over the long arc of time. 
Now let me turn it over to Rob to walk through the details of our financial performance."

On this page, we will review some Q3 financial metrics on a basis that includes the discontinued operations in order to compare our Q3 results to our previous guidance on an apples-to-apples basis. 
Including the businesses now classified as discontinued operations, we generated $1.621 billion of revenue and $602 million of EBITDA. Total debt was $3.91, which exceeded our Q3 debt guidance of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow for the quarter was $431 million, down 2% versus prior year. Year-to-date free cash flow is now up 29% through 3 quarters. 
Now turning to Page 8. Here, we will review some of the key income statement metrics on a continuing operations basis. Revenue increased 22% to $1.463 billion. Q2 organic revenue increased 12%, with strong growth across all 4 reporting segments, led by 17% organic growth in our Network Software segment. EBITDA increased 21% to $558 million. Net earnings grew 24% to $384 million and debt also grew 24% to $3.60. 
Next slide. Turning to Page 9. This slide will update you on the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Year-to-date, we have reduced our net debt by nearly $1.3 billion, and our total debt reduction is now $1 billion since completing the last of the 2020 acquisitions approximately 1 year ago. We continue to benefit from our excellent cash conversion as the nearly $2.3 billion of total EBITDA we generated over the last 4 quarters has converted to $1.94 billion of free cash flow, representing EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of 85%. 
At the end of September, our net debt to EBITDA has decreased to 3.5. We are on track to be near 3x by the end of 2021 and therefore, well positioned to return to capital deployment even before accounting for the divestitures. The proceeds from the divestitures further amplify our capacity with 5 billion plus available for deployment through 2022, as Neil highlighted earlier. 
Next slide. Moving now to Page 10. A quick look here at how the divestitures meaningfully improve our working capital position moving forward. This page repeats the working capital numbers we showed last October and adds a Q3 '21 column that shows the enterprise, including the removal of the 3 businesses being divested. We are now at negative 12% net working capital to revenue compared to negative 6% in the same quarter last year and negative 3% back in Q3 2019. 
Divesting TransCore reduces our net working capital by approximately $200 million, with the majority coming out of our unbilled receivables balance. This structurally lower net working capital positions us very well for continued high cash conversion moving forward. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover the segments."
22751,1683580585,2409803,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob.

Revenues in this segment were $603 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 4.4% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment, increased approximately 10%.  This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad. 
To highlight a few businesses, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end markets, had another good quarter. During the quarter, demand was particularly strong in enterprise GovCon and construction end markets. Importantly, during the quarter, Deltek also had success at the top end of market with their cloud or SaaS solutions. 
Vertafore, our agency management cloud software business focused on P&C insurance agencies, also had a nice quarter with very strong new bookings and nice expansion activity in some of their largest customers. Aderant, our legal software business, continued its momentum and market share gains. As we talked about last quarter, Aderant is gaining momentum for their SaaS solutions this quarter, setting a record for SaaS bookings activity. 
Consistent with the theme of this segment, PowerPlan was strong as well, both in terms of new bookings and adds to their recurring revenue base. It's nice to see PowerPlan's refocused strategy start to pay dividends. As it relates to our health care IT businesses, Strata, Data Innovations and CliniSys were rock solid in the quarter. 
For Strata, their recurring subscription-based software solutions continue to perform well and grow nicely. Strata's integration of EPSI is on track and nearly complete. The customer base continues to demonstrate excitement for this combination. Finally, CliniSys continues to gain market share in the U.K. lab market and has been established as 1 of the 4 strategic IT partners for the NHS. 
As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect organic recurring -- excuse me, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to that of the third quarter as recurring revenue growth rates are expected to remain strong. A solid quarter here for sure. 
And with that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to Page 13. The financial performance for this segment as well as the next 2, MAS and PT, are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenues in our Network segment were $343 million, up 17% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remained very strong at 51.6% in the quarter. The software businesses in this segment are now greater than 90% of the segment's revenue. Our NSS software growth was broad-based and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 17%.  At the business level, our freight match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our freight match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, with continued strength in the quarter on the carrier side of the network. In addition, these businesses had improving revenue per customer ARPU as the value of the network continues to increase with higher levels of network activity. 
Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, demonstrated continued recovery and growth in the quarter. Worth pointing out is Foundry's continued commitment to product innovation and the recent release of their AI-enabled NUC features that allow for more automated workflow steps within the video compositing process.
Our businesses that focus in and around the U.S. long-term care markets, MHA, FHP, SoftWriters, did particularly well in the quarter. iTrade Network, our perishable food supply chain network business, had in quarter as bookings growth was very strong and demonstrates a solid recovery in their end markets. Finally, we saw growth across the 2 product businesses within this segment, RF IDeas and Antibiotics, with particular strength in their health care end markets. As we look to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to see low double-digit growth in this segment, again, on a continuing ops basis. 
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 14, revenue in our MAS segment were $392 million, up 9% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was again north of 20%. Notably, this is the last quarter for the very difficult Verathon COVID comp, and we expect Verathon to return to growth in Q4. 
EBITDA margins for the segment were 32.4% in the quarter. The EBITDA margins in this segment were consistent with our expectations, but lower than prior year due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the cost impacts of certain businesses navigating their supply chain challenges. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. 
Before getting into business specific details, across this segment, demand can be characterized as being very strong. The demand was across all businesses and across both capital and consumable products. Product backlogs are up over 50% as compared to a year ago. Our businesses, each of which were impacted by supply chain challenges, navigated through the quarter.
As it relates to individual business performance, Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their incubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues, given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon is experiencing impressive growth with their Brocade product family and sustained growth across their bladder scan ultrasound franchise. 
Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter, with particular strength at NDI and CIVCO Medical Solutions. Strong demand at Neptune continued in the quarter. Neptune's end markets continue to open up and improve, but have not fully recovered, especially in the Northeast U.S. and Canada. Demand across our industrial businesses was robust as well and performance was strong, but somewhat impacted by supply chain challenges. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect low double-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on continued encouraging market conditions, both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. 
Now let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 15, revenues in our Process Tech segment were $124 million, up 16% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 31.6% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. 
The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and strong demand. Both orders and backlog were up approximately 50% in the quarter versus a year ago. Recovery in our upstream oil and gas businesses accelerated in the quarter. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is particularly -- or excuse me, this is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. 
Similar to that of our MAS industrial businesses, the businesses in this segment are being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate through these issues. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect high-teens organic growth based on improving market conditions. 
Now please turn to Page 17, where I'll highlight our increased outlook for 2021. Based on strong year-to-date performance and expected continued momentum, we're establishing full year 2021 guidance on a continuing ops basis of $14.08 to $14.12. As you read down this table, you will note that the full year debt impact for the businesses being divested is $1.18. If you combine this with our newly established continuing op guidance, you will note, we are raising our full year outlook on an apples-to-apples basis by $0.26 on the low end and $0.10 on the high end. As it relates to the fourth quarter, we're establishing, again, on a contending ops basis guidance in the range of $3.62 and $3.66. 
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. As we turn to Page 18 and our closing summary, our third quarter was a solid quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. Simultaneously, we undertook significant work to further the transformation of our business portfolio. Revenue, EBITDA and debt grew 20% plus. Organic revenue was up 12%. Across our enterprise, end market and customer demand was strong in terms of software, product capital items and consumables.
Throughout the quarter, our product businesses navigated through the market-based supply chain challenges. Given all of this, we're able to increase on an apples-to-apples basis our outlook for the full year. We also continued to deleverage our balance sheet by $1.8 billion since the 2020 acquisitions with net leverage now coming in at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. 
As it relates to the strategic governance of our enterprise, we're excited to be announcing the addition of Irene and Tom as new members of our Board of Directors. As part of our long-term Board refreshment strategy, these 2 new directors will complement our existing directors and help enable Roper to continue our track record of long-term cash flow compounding.
Over the last decade, we have worked to enhance the quality of our portfolio. To this end, recently, we took actions to meaningfully improve the quality of our portfolio by agreeing to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Once complete, Roper will be a better version of Roper. We'll have higher proportions of recurring revenue, higher organic growth prospects and be significantly more asset light. 
In addition, we expect to have roughly $5 billion of capital available to deploy between now and the end of 2022. And as it relates to our M&A pipeline, it is and always has been characterized, as having many high-quality opportunities. So we're clear, we are 100% back on offense when it comes to our capital deployment portion of our strategy and have fully resumed our usual, process-oriented and disciplined M&A activities. 
And with that, let's open it up to your questions."

I really appreciate all the reconciliation of previous guidance versus revised with the divestiture. So just set that aside. 
And the first question I want to ask is for Neil to help put in context these recent portfolio moves. And I don't want to parse your words, but the slide says accelerating a portfolio of transformation. You're not saying optimized. You're not trimming at the edges, but you are making some sizable moves here in a cluster. And it just begs the question, what is the strategic transformation? Is it more just making Roper, a better Roper? Or is there a more sizable change in portfolio composition coming and what the timing might be? We'll start there."
22751,1683580585,2409803,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dean. So it's all about Roper being a better version of ourself.

Thanks, Dean. So it's all about Roper being a better version of ourself. Our strategy, as you know, and most people listening know for the last 20 years has been fundamentally based on improving the quality of our enterprise. Historically, that's been characterized as being more asset light. More recently, it's not just that. But increasing mix towards recurring revenue, increasing mix towards higher -- slightly higher organic growth businesses. 
So that strategy has been in place and will remain in place. Nothing's changed there relative to these 3 transactions is really a result -- these 3 are a result of really 2 different decisions. Zetec was really an opportunistic situation with a strategic buyer who offered a compelling price, and it was just made sense in our view for our shareholders to let that go to that buyer and reduce a little bit of cyclicality and exposure to those Zetec end markets. 
As it relates to CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore, those were, while they're independent decisions, the result of a single process, which was our sort of our new and revised sort of deep strategic review of all the businesses. We do this with each business on a rolling sort of 3-year basis. The CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore reviews were late last year, early this year, and we just felt, given their future growth prospects, which are interesting and likely robust but also capital intensive. In both cases, we're going to just be suboptimized with us as an owner. You overlay that where the valuation we'll get for the businesses, the 3 together roughly 20x this year, just made sense from all vectors for us."

Highly collaborative group, but one where people express their points of view open and freely. 
So it's a great environment. Also, as in governance, there's a refreshment process that goes with that. The Board Chair that became the Board Chair at Brian's passing, Bill Prezzano just aged off the Board. And we have a sort of that requirement to refresh the Board, and we're super fortunate to have Irene and Tom join us. Irene will bring just a tremendous -- she's most recently, professionally, is an executive with Time Warner, but a long track record in financial institutions. Just a very astute and financially say executive, understands risk and risk management and is also a very experienced Board member at this stage in her career. 
Tom, this will be his first public -- outside public company board everybody here listening knows Tom very well, but just the combination of what he's done in his 30-year career at Danaher, combination of business building and capital deployment.

That's what cash return is. It is our North Star. It will continue to be our North Star. It's just -- it's core to our culture here. 
Allison, in terms of your question about the number of targets, mathematically, yes, the number of targets are fewer as we're looking to buy companies that have CRI that are higher than our existing, but it's not a limiter to our strategy, right?

For us, relative to the headwinds, yes, it was -- growth was limited a bit certainly across all of our product businesses. And then also the choice that our business has made when there's an opportunity to either expedite a part or go into a spot market or an alternative source for a part and pay incrementally a bit more, they did that.

There's about $5 billion of M&A firepower between now and the next year. 
So that's all good. The balance sheet is in good shape, where, as we mentioned, we're super active in the M&A markets. But we always have been and always will be patient and disciplined, right? I mean this is -- every deal matters. We're buying these businesses with the very long term in mind to never sell them.

The thing that's about the market itself, the markets are opening but nowhere close to fully recovered, especially in Canada and less so, but certainly not open in the Northeast United States and the U.S. Northeast. 
Final thing I'd say about Neptune is the strategy here is -- I mean, is very clear and it appears to be working, if you will, having traction around the strategy on the product with the static meter product that were introduced to the market the way we read the data off the meter and importantly, now the software analytics that play that Neptune is developing around what do you do with all the data once you catch it off the meter on a more frequent basis.

Just to level set everybody, the vast majority of the revenue on the network side of our business is already in the cloud and/or recurring. It's 90-plus percent. So the vast, vast majority of the cloud conversions, Rob, what you're talking about shows up in our Application Software segment and is centered at Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan, a little bit at Seaport. 
As you mentioned, when you convert -- the punchline of all this is that we convert, we believe it's a modest net growth driver, not a headwind. The reason it's a growth driver is you have 2 competing factors. One is the bad guy you're referring to, the J-curve, when you -- instead of selling a perpetual deal, you sell a recurring revenue deal. In the year of that deal, that's a bad guy, right? Because instead of getting 100% of revenue when you ship the perpetual license, you get some small percentage of that, depending on what month the subscription is booked. 
However, what counters that is when you have these large installed base of customers that are paying annual maintenance on their historical perpetual we're actively lifting and shifting those customers to the cloud. And when you do that, because what you're doing for them carries more value, right? You're on the current release. You're managing the infrastructure. You're managing cybersecurity. You're managing -- there's a greater value proposition. You're able to charge a higher recurring revenue base. 
And so the uplift on the recurring overwhelms the negative headwind on that upfront sale and that becomes a modest net growth driver for us. Happy to talk about that offline in more detail if you'd like."

Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.  
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.  
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.  
And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During and subsequent to the third quarter, Roper signed definitive agreements to divest its TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the numbers shown in this presentation are on a continuing operations basis.  
For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; and lastly, income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix to this presentation on our website.  
And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?"

We're looking forward to sharing with you the details of our solid quarter performance as well as summarizing the acceleration of our portfolio transformation. 
As we look at the sequence of our call this morning, we'll start with our quarterly highlights and our recent divestiture activity. I'll then turn the call over to Rob, who will share the details of our financial performance and our bridge to continued operations. I'll then walk everyone through our segment-by-segment performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. As usual, we'll leave plenty of time to talk to all of your questions towards the end.  
Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, this was another quarter of solid operational and excellent financial performance. On a continuing ops basis, we grew revenue, EBITDA and DEPS north of 20% in the quarter. It's important to highlight and characterize the underlying strength of these results. Revenue on an organic basis grew 12% in the quarter. End market and customer demand was very strong across our portfolio within both our software and product businesses. 
Importantly, our software segments were strong operationally with 10% growth in one segment and 17% in the other. Our software businesses' recurring revenue grew low double digits in the quarter, highlighting the underlying strength, stability and increasing quality of our revenue base. To remind everyone, about 80% of our software revenues are recurring in nature. It's also worth noting that our 2020 acquisition cohort, led by Vertafore, continues to perform very well.  
As it relates to our product businesses, like most other companies, we are experiencing supply chain and logistical challenges, but the businesses nevertheless performed very well during the third quarter. As mentioned, customer demand was very strong throughout the quarter and, backlogs are up over 50% versus last year. 
Given this strong operational performance, we continued our disciplined deleveraging of our balance sheet with net debt at 3.5x trailing EBITDA. Also, we are improving the outlook for the year, which we'll detail later in the call.  
Earlier this morning, we announced 2 new additions to our Board of Directors, Irene Esteves and Tom Joyce. The addition of Irene and Tom to our Board is part of our long-term Board refreshment process. Both are tremendous additions to our Board.  
Finally, we've been active over the last few months working to accelerate the transformation of our portfolio through the announced divestiture of 3 businesses. Let's turn to the next slide, Page 6, to walk through those details and highlights. Next slide, please.  
During the last several weeks, we entered into definitive agreements to divest 3 of our businesses, TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy, the last of which we announced this morning. We agreed to divest TransCore to ST Engineering for $2.68 billion. In our view, this is the right time and the right buyer for TransCore given their forward strategy and growth outlook. Taken together, we're divesting these 3 businesses for $3.15 billion or about 20x this year's EBITDA. 
Following the completion of these deals, Roper will be improved. We will have a higher quality portfolio characterized by having higher proportions of recurring revenue, a higher organic growth profile and be significantly more asset-light. Finally, we are and will be very active in deploying these after-tax proceeds. Together with our internally generated cash flow, we will have about $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy between now and the end of 2022, none of which is included in our current financial outlook. Our enterprise will be even further enhanced once we complete this activity.  
Before I turn it over to Rob, I wanted to take a moment and highlight Roper's ability to govern, build and improve businesses over the long term. As part of these transactions, we are retaining our DAT and Loadlink network software businesses, which are purchased together with TransCore in 2004, and we are retaining our CIVCO Medical Solutions business. Given we do not usually get clean bookends to transaction activity, this provides a unique opportunity to talk about the business building that occurs within Roper. Specifically, just after the acquisition of TransCore, we established DAT and Loadlink as stand-alone businesses with independent strategies and management teams who operate within Roper's governance and incentive system. Over the course of the last 15 years, these businesses have consolidated freight networks, continuously innovated their product solutions, built go-to-market capability and grown revenues high single digits on a compounded organic basis.  
Similarly, the retained CIVCO Medical Solutions business has grown high single digits on an organic basis over the last 15 years as well. During this period of time, CIVCO Medical Solutions has continually innovated their product solutions, including the recent gel-free ultrasound products; and fundamentally restructured their go-to-market strategy. At Roper, we buy great businesses and provide an environment and incentive system where they get even better over a long arc of time.  
Now let me turn it over to Rob to walk through the details of our financial performance."
22751,1683580585,2409874,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 7. On this page, we will review some Q3 financial metrics on a basis that includes the discontinued operations in order to compare our Q3 results to our previous guidance on an apples-to-apples basis.",461,"Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 7. On this page, we will review some Q3 financial metrics on a basis that includes the discontinued operations in order to compare our Q3 results to our previous guidance on an apples-to-apples basis.  
Including the businesses now classified as discontinued operations, we generated $1.621 billion of revenue and $602 million of EBITDA. Total DEPS was $3.91, which exceeded our Q3 DEPS guidance of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow for the quarter was $431 million, down 2% versus prior year. Year-to-date free cash flow is now up 29% through 3 quarters.  
Now turning to Page 8. Here, we will review some of the key income statement metrics on a continuing operations basis. Revenue increased 22% to $1.463 billion. Q2 organic revenue increased 12%, with strong growth across all 4 reporting segments, led by 17% organic growth in our network software segment. EBITDA increased 21% to $558 million. Net earnings grew 24% to $384 million, and DEPS also grew 24% to $3.60.  
Next slide. Turning to Page 9. This slide will update you on the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story. Year-to-date, we have reduced our net debt by nearly $1.3 billion, and our total debt reduction is now $1.8 billion since completing the last of the 2020 acquisitions approximately 1 year ago. We continue to benefit from our excellent cash conversion as the nearly $2.3 billion of total EBITDA we generated over the last 4 quarters has converted to $1.94 billion of free cash flow, representing EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of 85%.  
At the end of September, our net debt to EBITDA has decreased to 3.5. We are on track to be near 3x by the end of 2021 and therefore well positioned to return to capital deployment even before accounting for the divestitures. The proceeds from the divestitures further amplify our capacity with $5 billion plus available for deployment through 2022, as Neil highlighted earlier.  
Next slide. Moving now to Page 10. A quick look here at how the divestitures meaningfully improve our working capital position moving forward. This page repeats the working capital numbers we showed last October and adds a Q3 '21 column that shows the enterprise including the removal of the 3 businesses being divested. 
We are now at negative 12% net working capital to revenue compared to negative 6% in the same quarter last year and negative 3% back in Q3 2019. Divesting TransCore reduces our net working capital by approximately $200 million, with the majority coming out of our unbilled receivables balance. This structurally lower net working capital positions us very well for continued high cash conversion moving forward.  
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover the segments."
22751,1683580585,2409874,"Roper Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 12 and walk through our Application Software segment. Revenues in this segment were $603 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue,",1718,"Thanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 12 and walk through our Application Software segment. Revenues in this segment were $603 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the quarter. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment, increase approximately 10%. This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was broad.  
To highlight a few businesses. Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end markets, had another good quarter. During the quarter, demand was particularly strong in enterprise, GovCon and construction end markets. Importantly, during the quarter, Deltek also had success at the top end of market with their cloud or SaaS solutions.  
Vertafore, our agency management cloud software business focused on P&C insurance agencies, also had a nice quarter with very strong new bookings and nice expansion activity in some of their largest customers. Aderant, our legal software business, continued its momentum and market share gains. As we talked about last quarter, Aderant is gaining momentum for their SaaS solutions; this quarter, setting a record for SaaS bookings activity. Consistent with the theme of this segment, PowerPlan was strong as well, both in terms of new bookings and adds to their recurring revenue base. It's nice to see PowerPlan's refocused strategy start to pay dividends. 
As it relates to our health care IT businesses, Strata, Data Innovations and CliniSys were rock solid in the quarter. For Strata, their recurring subscription-based software solutions continue to perform well and grow nicely. Strata's integration of EPSi is on track and nearly complete. The customer base continues to demonstrate excitement for this combination. Finally, CliniSys continues to gain market share in the U.K. lab market and has been established as 1 of the 4 strategic IT partners for the NHS.  
As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect organic recurring -- excuse me, we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to that of the third quarter as recurring revenue growth rates are expected to remain strong. A solid quarter here for sure.  
And with that, let's turn to the next slide. Turning to Page 13. The financial performance for this segment as well as the next 2, MAS and PT, are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenues in our network segment were $343 million, up 17% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins remained very strong at 51.6% in the quarter. The software businesses in this segment are now greater than 90% of the segment's revenue. Our NSS software growth was broad-based and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 17%. 
At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the U.S. and Canada, continue to be solid growers. As a reminder, our freight match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. Strength in our businesses have been on both sides of the network, brokers and carriers, with continued strength in the quarter on the carrier side of the network. In addition, these businesses had improving revenue per customer ARPU as the value of the network continues to increase with higher levels of network activity.  
Foundry, our media and entertainment software business which enables the combination of live action and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, demonstrated continued recovery and growth in the quarter. Worth pointing out is Foundry's continued commitment to product innovation and the recent release of their AI-enabled Nuke features that allow for more automated workflow steps within the video compositing process. 
Our businesses that focus in and around the U.S. long-term care markets, MHA, SHP, SoftWriters, did particularly well in the quarter. iTradeNetwork, our perishable food supply chain network business, had a nice quarter as bookings growth was very strong and demonstrates a solid recovery in their end markets. Finally, we saw growth across the 2 product businesses within this segment, RF IDeas and Inovonics, with particular strength in their health care end markets. As we look to the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to see low double-digit growth in this segment, again, on a continuing ops basis.  
Please turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 14, revenue in our MAS segment were $392 million, up 9% on an organic basis. Organic growth in this segment, excluding Verathon, was again north of 20%. Notably, this is the last quarter for the very difficult Verathon COVID comp, and we expect Verathon to return to growth in Q4.  
EBITDA margins for the segment were 32.4% in the quarter. The EBITDA margins in this segment were consistent with our expectations but lower than prior year due to Verathon's extraordinary prior year quarter and the cost impacts of certain businesses navigating their supply chain challenges. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis.  
Before getting into business-specific details, across this segment, demand can be characterized as being very strong. The demand was across all businesses and across both capital and consumable products. Product backlogs are up over 50% as compared to a year ago. Our businesses, each of which were impacted by supply chain challenges, navigated through the quarter. 
As it relates to individual business performance, Verathon, coming off unprecedented demand for their incubation family of products a year ago, is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment which enables recurring consumable pull-through volumes. In addition, Verathon is experiencing impressive growth within their bronchoscope product family and sustained growth across their BladderScan ultrasound franchise. Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter with particular strength at NDI and CIVCO Medical Solutions. 
Strong demand at Neptune continued in the quarter. Neptune's end markets continue to open up and improve but have not fully recovered, especially in the Northeast U.S. and Canada. Demand across our industrial businesses was robust as well and performance was strong but somewhat impacted by supply chain challenges. For the fourth quarter, we expect low double-digit organic growth for this segment. This is based on continued encouraging market conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon.  
Now let's turn to our final segment, process tech. As we turn to Page 15, revenues in our process tech segment were $124 million, up 16% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 31.6% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and strong demand. Both orders and backlog were up approximately 50% in the quarter versus a year ago. 
Recovery in our upstream oil and gas businesses accelerated in the quarter. Cornell continues to perform well for us. This is particularly -- or excuse me, this is partially based on market conditions but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. Similar to that of our MAS industrial businesses, the businesses in this segment are being impacted by supply chain challenges but continue to navigate through these issues. As we turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect high-teens organic growth based on improving market conditions.  
Now please turn to Page 17 where I'll highlight our increased outlook for 2021. Based on strong year-to-date performance and expected continued momentum, we're establishing full year 2021 guidance on a continuing ops basis of $14.08 to $14.12. As you read down this table, you will note that the full year DEPS impact for the businesses being divested is $1.18. If you combine this with our newly established continuing op guidance, you will note we are raising our full year outlook on an apples-to-apples basis by $0.26 on the low end and $0.10 on the high end. As it relates to the fourth quarter, we're establishing, again, on a continuing ops basis guidance in the range of $3.62 and $3.66.  
Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. As we turn to Page 18 and our closing summary, our third quarter was a solid quarter from both an operational and financial perspective. Simultaneously, we undertook significant work to further the transformation of our business portfolio. Revenue, EBITDA and DEPS grew 20% plus. Organic revenue was up 12%. Across our enterprise, end market and customer demand was strong in terms of software, product capital items and consumables. 
Throughout the quarter, our product businesses navigated through the market-based supply chain challenges. Given all of this, we're able to increase, on an apples-to-apples basis, our outlook for the full year. We also continued to deleverage our balance sheet by $1.8 billion since the 2020 acquisitions with net leverage now coming in at 3.5x trailing EBITDA.  
As it relates to the strategic governance of our enterprise, we're excited to be announcing the addition of Irene and Tom as new members of our Board of Directors. As part of our long-term Board refreshment strategy, these 2 new directors will complement our existing directors and help enable Roper to continue our track record of long-term cash flow compounding. 
Over the last decade, we have worked to enhance the quality of our portfolio. To this end, recently, we took actions to meaningfully improve the quality of our portfolio by agreeing to divest TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Once complete, Roper will be a better version of Roper. We'll have higher proportions of recurring revenue, higher organic growth prospects and be significantly more asset light.  
In addition, we expect to have roughly $5 billion of capital available to deploy between now and the end of 2022. And as it relates to our M&A pipeline, it is and always has been characterized as having many high-quality opportunities.

And there's a lot of moving parts this quarter. I really appreciate all the reconciliation of previous guidance versus revised with the divestiture. So just set that aside and the first question I want to ask is for Neil to help put in context these recent portfolio moves. 
And I don't want to parse your words, but the slide says accelerating the portfolio transformation. You're not saying optimize. You're not trimming at the edges, but you are making some sizable moves here in a cluster. And it just begs the question, what is the strategic transformation? Is it more just making Roper a better Roper? Or is there a more sizable change in portfolio composition coming and what the timing might be? We'll start there."

Thanks, Deane. So it's all about Roper being a better version of ourself. Our strategy, as you know and most people listening know, for the last 20 years has been fundamentally based on improving the quality of our enterprise. Historically, that's been characterized as being more asset-light. More recently, it's not just that, but increasing mix towards recurring revenue, increasing mix towards higher -- slightly higher organic growth businesses.  
So that strategy has been in place and will remain in place. Nothing's changed there relative to these 3 transactions. It's really a result -- these 3 are a result of really 2 different decisions. Zetec was really an opportunistic situation with a strategic buyer who offered a compelling price, and it just made sense, in our view, for our shareholders to let that go to that buyer and reduce a little bit of cyclicality and exposure to those Zetec end markets.  
As it relates to CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore, those were, while they're independent decisions, the result of a single process, which was our -- sort of our new and revised sort of deep strategic review of all the businesses. We do this with each business on a rolling sort of 3-year basis. The CIVCO Radiotherapy and TransCore reviews were late last year, early this year. And we just felt, given their future growth prospects which are interesting and likely robust but also capital intensive, in both cases, we're going to just -- they'd be suboptimized with us as an owner. You overlay that with the valuation we'll get for the businesses, the 3 together roughly 20x this year. It just made sense from all vectors for us."

The Board, we highly engage with 5 times a year, 3 days each time, so it's a Board that works hard. They enjoy working hard. 
It's a Board -- in that amount of time that we spend, it's not just a series of presentations. There is space to have conversations, deliberation, challenge one another and then form a point of view on the forward direction of our enterprise. Highly collaborative group but one where people express their points of view open and freely, so it's a great environment. 
Also, in governance, there's a refreshment process that goes with that. The Board Chair that became the Board Chair at Brian's passing, Bill Prezzano, just aged off the Board. And so we have a sort of that requirement to refresh the Board, and we're super fortunate to have Irene and Tom join us. Irene will bring just a tremendous -- she most recently professionally is an executive with Time Warner but a long track record in financial institutions, just a very astute and financially savvy executive, understands risk and risk management and is also a very experienced Board member at this stage in her career.  
Tom, this will be his first outside public company Board, and everybody here listening knows Tom very well. But just the combination of what he's done in his 30-year career at Danaher, combination of business building and capital deployment, leader development is core to what we are all about. And I think both will just bring tremendous new thoughts to our boardroom as we continue to evolve and build our business."

It is how we not just -- it just not only guides our capital deployment strategy, it guides every operational decision in the business. It defines for us, for instance, what good organic growth is versus just growth at any cost, right? 
It's how do you -- and CRI, for those that aren't intimate with it, is really just a measure of business quality. Do you have a cash flow -- a relationship with your customer, if you will, where you're able to provide value, capture value for that and have an underlying business model that doesn't require a lot of assets to deliver that value? That's what cash return is. It is our North Star. It will continue to be our North Star. It's just -- it's core to our culture here. 
Allison, in terms of your question about the number of targets, mathematically, yes, the number of targets are fewer as we're looking to buy companies that have CRI that are higher than our existing. But it's not a limiter to our strategy, right?

And so first, I would say our business is more broadly like most businesses maybe around the world, certainly in this country over the last 20 years, have built their supply chain to optimize on the lowest cost and less so on resiliency. A nice thing that our businesses did starting a couple of years ago is built some resiliency with the China sort of tariff situation. So that was a precursor that helped us a bit. 
For us, relative to the headwinds, yes, it was -- growth was limited a bit certainly across all of our product businesses. And then also, the choice that our business has made when there's an opportunity to either expedite a part or go into a spot market or an alternative source for a part and pay incrementally a bit more, they did that.

The final thing I'd say about Neptune is the strategy here is -- I mean, is very clear and it appears to be working, if you will, having traction around the strategy on the product with the static meter product that were introduced to the market, the way we read the data off the meter and importantly now, the software and analytics play that Neptune is developing around what do you do with all that data once you capture it off the meter on a more frequent basis.

Just to level set everybody, the vast majority of the revenue on the network side of our business is already in the cloud and/or recurring. It's 90-plus percent. So the vast, vast majority of the cloud conversions, Rob, what you're talking about, shows up in our Application Software segment and is centered at Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan, a little bit at CBORD. 
As you mentioned, when you convert -- the punchline of all this is that we convert -- we believe it's a modest net growth driver, not a headwind. The reason it's a growth driver is you have 2 competing factors. One is the bad guy you're referring to, the J-curve. When you -- instead of selling a perpetual deal, you sell a recurring revenue deal. In the year of that deal, that's a bad guy, right? Because instead of getting 100% of revenue when you ship the perpetual license, you get some small percentage of that, depending on what month the subscription is booked. 
However, what counters that is when you have these large installed base of customers that are paying annual maintenance on their historical perpetual, we're actively lifting and shifting those customers to the cloud. And when you do that, because what you're doing for them carries more value right, you're on the current release, you're managing the infrastructure, you're managing cybersecurity, you're managing -- there's a greater value proposition, you're able to charge a higher recurring revenue base. And so the uplift on the recurring overwhelms the negative headwind on that upfront sale, and that becomes a modest net growth driver for us. Happy to talk about that offline in more detail if you'd like."
