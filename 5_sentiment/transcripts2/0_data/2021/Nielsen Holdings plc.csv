I",2138,"Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call today. We'll cover our Q4 and 2020 results, but I want to spend most of my time today looking ahead at 2021. 
We have an exciting year ahead with strong momentum built off solid execution in 2020. I hope that you were all able to attend our Investor Day in December, where we laid out a detailed plan to maximize shareholder value for the New Nielsen. We refer to the New Nielsen as what our company will look like pro forma after the pending sale of Connect. Following the sale, Nielsen will be the must-have data and analytics provider for the entire media ecosystem. 
Let me remind you of the 3 key messages from Investor Day. First, we are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets, and we are doing this globally; second, we are undergoing a cultural shift with a growth-driven mindset; and third, we have a compelling financial model, reflective of a leading data and analytics company. I'm going to lead off with the last point, our compelling financial model, as shown by the resiliency of our business in 2020 and our improving financial profile. Our guidance issued today is consistent with the preliminary 2021 outlook we provided at Investor Day. And our confidence in our ability to deliver this has only grown since December. Linda will provide greater detail later in the call, but I want to review our 2021 outlook at a high level. 
We expect 3.5% to 4.5% organic revenue growth. We are laying the path to achieve our medium-term goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We'll see margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points with 150 basis points of total margin expansion expected through 2023. And we expect free cash flow of $580 million to $630 million for the New Nielsen. We remain focused on achieving free cash flow conversion of 50%, which will help drive free cash flow above $800 million by 2023. And we are also forecasting adjusted EPS of $1.43 to $1.54. 
And finally, our balance sheet will improve as we pay down approximately $2 billion of our debt from our agreement to Sell Nielsen Connect to Advent International. We received shareholder approval for the sale at our special shareholder meeting in February with 99% of the shareholders who voted voting in favor of the transaction. We are making good progress on the other necessary approvals and customary closing conditions, and we expect this transaction to close within the next 90 days. Our confidence in our growth forecast starts with the strong foundation we laid in 2019 and 2020, including our cultural shift to a growth-driven mindset. 2020 was obviously a challenging year given the global pandemic, but Nielsen adapted incredibly well. I am proud of all that we accomplished, and I want to thank each and every one of my Nielsen colleagues for their resilience, courage and focus. 
While our 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the pandemic, we still delivered adjusted EBITDA and EPS within the pre-COVID initial guidance range we provided you at this time last year, and free cash flow was above the initial range. We achieved these results by quickly adapting and evolving throughout the organization, especially in the field, our call centers and our products. 
Importantly, our actions were not just temporary reactions to the COVID pandemic. We created permanent structural improvements by enacting our optimization plan midyear. We rationalized the product portfolio with a focus on essential, higher-margin syndicated businesses. We also simplified the underlying technology and data science around 2 unique global platforms, one for audience and one for content, which will drive faster and bolder innovation in 2021 and beyond, taking advantage of the rapid media ecosystem evolution that has only accelerated over the past year. 
Finally, we strengthened our leadership team and our Board of Directors. Together, we are driving the cultural shift to a growth mindset across the entire organization, led by our diverse leadership team. I want to add that our increased focus on diversity, equity and inclusion was essential to achieving our solid 2020 results. We focused on every member of the Nielsen team being able to feel safe and supported this year, and this helped our people show up in amazing ways. We have also focused on being an inclusive business, and we see great value from insisting that all of our partners share our accountability to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We've discussed our compelling financial model and our cultural transformation. Now let me address the final key message from Investor Day. The New Nielsen is driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets worldwide. I'll walk you through our 3 essential solutions, Audience Measurement, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services. Starting with Audience Measurement. In December, we announced the planned launch of Nielsen One, our new cross media measurement solution. Nielsen One evolves the Nielsen Ratings to a single measurement solution for both streaming and broadcast consumption. This is an enormous innovation for Nielsen and for the media industry. It's a transformative move that is critical to the future of the media ecosystem. 
The industry's critical need was validated by clients at our Nielsen One launch event, where industry leaders such as Unilever, Mastercard, NBC, Google and GroupM and others discussed the need for a single currency across streaming and broadcast. If you weren't able to attend the virtual launch, I recommend watching the replay, which is available on our website. These and other companies are also actively involved now in the advisory committees for Nielsen One. We are starting up 2021 with clear proof points that we are advancing on our cross-media vision. At Investor Day, we laid out the road map for the major components of Nielsen One through 2022. We are delivering as planned on these interim milestones toward the Nielsen One launch today, and clients are already using our new capabilities. 
Our cross-media measurement solution has 3 fundamental principles at its core: resiliency, coverage and comparability, and we are making good progress across all 3 principles. Let me provide you some color. First, resiliency is built through more data sources. In Q4, we announced strategic data partnerships with VIZIO, DIRECTV and DISH to unlock addressable measurement. This builds on the existing relationships we have in place for local measurement, the return path data we ingest from Comcast, Charter, DISH and DIRECTV. Of course, there is noise and biases in big data alone, which is why our gold standard, Nielsen panels, are essential to clean and correct this data. We are strengthening our resiliency by upgrading our panel to include streaming meters and an advanced nanometer across the entire base. We recently met our initial goal of 10,000 streaming meters, and we expect to have streaming meters in 100% of panelist homes as we refresh the panel over the next 24 months or so. 
Second, coverage. We are expanding our connected TV footprint, as we said we would with the addition of YouTube, YouTube TV and VIZIO, and we'll work to further this. We've also recently expanded coverage of streaming to include the viewing of movie releases that are directly available to consumers through streaming or MVPD platforms. For the first time, we released viewership data for Warner Media's HBO Max streaming platform for their blockbuster, Wonder Woman 1984. 
The third principle, comparability, is enabled by all of our measurement solutions being built off a single Nielsen Audience ID. This ID was built in 2020 and successfully tested in Q4 as planned. The idea allows us to deduplicate metrics and ensure that we have one view of reach and frequency across both broadcast and streaming signals. In January of 2021, we implemented the new measurement methodology for digital ad ratings, which is our flagship digital offering, and I'm also proud to announce that we were recently recognized by the media industry with an Emmy award for our technology innovation to measure video viewing across a multi-platform service, technology that's core to Nielsen One. 
And finally, I want to remind you that Nielsen One is a global vision. Any new markets, such as last year's wins in Denmark and Saudi Arabia, will be on the Nielsen One solution, and we will convert the rest of our markets over the next 2 to 3 years. 
Let me turn to Plan/Optimize. This is where our 2 other essential solutions, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services are housed. Given the portfolio rationalization we did in the 2020 optimization plan, we will now start referring to Plan/Optimize as outcomes and content, which is more precisely descriptive of the remaining products and services. 
Starting with Audience Outcomes. We are one of the largest outcomes measurement providers in the media ecosystem globally, helping clients plan their cross-media spend and answer questions like, did the viewer visit the dealership or buy the product online? We already do this today, but we have the opportunity to accelerate outcomes growth with new clients, new syndicatable products built on a single platform and connecting our cross-media measurement to Outcomes, which is the key only at Nielsen differentiator. A key element of our growth strategy is further expanding in verticals beyond consumer packaged goods, which are currently the vast majority of our advertiser clients, yet represent only 10% of the world's ad spend. We have recently organized our sales teams to better focus on end markets, such as financial services, insurance, pharmaceuticals, automotive, retail, digital brands and technology, and this has already driven new client wins across these verticals. In fact, at Investor Day, we mentioned success with a number of leading brands such as Visa, Equifax, PETCO, Volkswagen and LVMH. We've expanded with LVMH to now include their Bulgari division, and we've added new clients such as Spotify, Flipkart and others. These wins span both the U.S. and international markets. 
Our progress is underpinned by our technology transformation, which is helping to shorten turnaround times, bring on new clients faster and accelerate product innovation. Earlier this month, we announced our new ID resolution methodology for attribution, which enables advertisers and publishers to understand the entire consumer journey across platforms, better optimize their spend and prove the impact of advertising even if cookies go away. 
Finally, let me turn to Gracenote Content Services. As you may remember, Gracenote is the market leader in entertainment metadata. We power the consumer entertainment experience on a truly global basis. For example, Gracenote provides detailed information on movies and TV shows that you see on your cable program guys or discover on your streaming services. Gracenote also provides real-time sports score statistics for the world's top leagues, events, teams and players to use in their audience experience. Gracenote has deployed in over 120 million cars worldwide, providing data through car entertainment systems. And Gracenote information on artists and songs powers music services and consumer electronics brands. Gracenote metadata is the de facto standard across the entertainment industry. Virtually, every consumer interacts with Gracenote metadata multiple times in any given day. We are focused on 3 key growth opportunities for Gracenote Content Services. First, more audiences, content, markets and platforms. Means that there are more opportunities for our core Gracenote metadata services. We're growing our substantial base by adding new platforms, markets and content and increasing the capacity and speed of our ability to grow metadata. We have been building our global leadership position with key industry players, such as Comcast, Samsung, Google and Liberty Global. Second, we're developing new solutions for new products across discovery, marketing and insights. For example, last week, we launched Gracenote inclusion analytics to accelerate diversity and content and enable clients to create more resonant programming backed by our data-driven analytics. And third, we have a bold ambition for Gracenote. Gracenote can help studios leverage the great content ID to attach a unique identifier to their content, which will serve to simplify and scale the distribution and discovery of content across the full range of channels and streaming services used by audiences today. 
To sum up, we are excited about the opportunities ahead in 2021 and beyond. We have a compelling financial model. We are shifting our culture to that of a growth mindset, and we are executing on key initiatives to drive accelerating growth through new solutions and new clients. Building on our progress in 2020, we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the 2021 plan and to deliver our medium-term targets. We are indeed a New Nielsen, strongly positioned for the future and ready to deliver enhanced value to our clients and to our shareholders. 
I'm now happy to turn the call over to Linda to review the financials and provide greater detail on our 2021 guidance. Linda?"

As David highlighted, the fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid performance and financial resilience during an unprecedented time due to the global pandemic.

As David highlighted, the fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid performance and financial resilience during an unprecedented time due to the global pandemic. Before I review the results, let me reflect on the meaningful accomplishments in 2020. First, when it became clear that COVID was going to have a global impact on our revenue, we focused on quickly adapting to ensure the continuity of our business processes and to mitigate potential impact. We also took swift action in late Q1 to lower cost by at least $200 million in 2020, including approximately $100 million in media. These were temporary cuts that do return this year. Our resilient business model and highly contracted business gave us visibility into 2020 despite the uncertainty of the pandemic, and we were able to continue to provide guidance and deliver strong results. 
Second, we began to execute the optimization plan announced in July, which includes $250 million of annualized run rate permanent cost savings in the second half of 2020 and beyond, split roughly evenly between Media and Connect. We've executed well and realized about half of the savings in 2020 with the balance expected in 2021. The temporary cost cuts and the optimization plan drove strong margin expansion in the second half of 2020, but will result in tougher comps for EBITDA and margin in the second half of 2021. 
Third, we were active in the debt markets in 2020, successfully refinancing approximately $3 billion of debt with 5- to 10-year maturity. We ended 2020 at 4.09x net leverage, in line with our expectation. 
And finally, we announced the planned sale of Connect and a few weeks later hosted an Investor Day. Given the February 11 shareholder approval of the sale, we will begin reporting Connect as a discontinued operation beginning with the first quarter results. Today's 2020 commentary will cover Media and Connect, consistent with our prior reporting. 
With that as a backdrop for what we accomplished in a busy 2020, let me now turn to our financial results. I'll start with Slide 6 to review the fourth quarter and full year 2020. We achieved or exceeded our revised 2020 guidance across all key measures. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.8% in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year, in line with our guidance of down 4% to 2%. On an organic basis, revenue declined 2% in the fourth quarter and 3.1% for the year. COVID continued to impact the fourth quarter, though at a slightly lesser pace than in the third quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $560 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.5%, up 458 basis points in constant currency. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $1.882 billion, up 2.7% constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA was towards the high end of the original pre-COVID guidance we provided last February of $1.83 billion to $1.91 billion. For the year, revenue was down $208 million, while costs were down $237 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.9%. Margins were up 147 basis points on a constant currency basis and towards the high end of the 29.5% to 30% guidance range. The temporary and permanent cost savings drove significant margin expansion in the second half of the year in both Media and Connect. 
Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.53 compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2019 on higher EBITDA, offset in part by higher taxes. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.67 compared to $1.80 in 2019, above our guidance range of $1.54 to a $1.62. As compared to the prior year, the $1.67 adjusted EPS reflects higher EBITDA, lower interest expense and tax favorability, which was more than offset by higher depreciation and amortization. Our effective tax rate was 41% in the fourth quarter and 90% for the full year, albeit on low full year pretax income of $74 million. A number of our tax costs are more fixed than variable in nature and can therefore have an outsized impact on the tax rate when pretax results are low. Adjusting for the discrete items, our tax rate would have been approximately 33% in 2020 after also adjusting book income for the impairment charges. We incurred $131 million in impairment charges in Q4 related to the value of Connect's trade name and internally developed software, mostly related to Connect. We exclude these charges from adjusted EPS. We ended the year with $144 million of restructuring expenses, slightly below our forecast as we gained efficiencies on our restructuring plan. 
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $598 million of free cash flow in 2020, up from $547 million in 2019 and above the high end of our initial pre-COVID guidance range of by $580 million and our updated guidance range of $550 million. These results include $118 million of separation-related cash payments in 2020, which was lower than our prior expectations as some larger pension and tax payments shifted into 2021. 
Key drivers of the year-over-year free cash flow improvement include higher EBITDA, lower cash taxes, lower interest expense and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher restructuring and working capital. Despite the pandemic, cash collections remained solid throughout 2020. 
Now let's turn to the segment results. On Slide 7, I'll review the Media segment results, starting with the Q4 results on the left. Revenue for Q4 was $872 million, down 2.6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or down 1.8% organic. While we continue to see ongoing impact from COVID, performance in the quarter was ahead of our expectations. 
Audience Measurement revenue declined 0.2% constant currency and grew 0.2% on an organic basis. We continue to see pressure in local television and COVID-related pressure in sports and ad hoc products. 
Plan/Optimize revenues declined 8.1% constant currency in the fourth quarter with organic revenue down 6.5%. This adjusts for exits and the Q4 '19 divestiture of our music business. COVID continued to impact sports, Gracenote auto and short-cycle revenue. Despite the revenue decline, Media's Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $393 million, up 4% constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.1% were up 284 basis points in constant currency. 
Moving to the right side of the page. Full year revenue was down 2.3% constant currency, in line with the guidance range of down 3% to 2%. Organic revenue was down 1.7%. Audience Measurement revenue declined 0.5% with organic revenue down 0.3%. Plan/Optimize revenue declined 6.7% constant currency for the full year with organic revenue down 5.2%. 
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $1.474 billion, which is roughly flat on a constant currency basis compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 43.9%, up 94 basis points year-over-year, supported by the temporary and permanent cost savings initiatives we discussed, offset in part by investments in growth initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'll discuss high-level results for the Connect segment, starting with Q4 results on the left side of the page. Fourth quarter revenue was $800 million, down 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue was down 2.3%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $176 million was up 41.9% on a constant currency basis. Margins of 22% were up an impressive 663 basis points constant currency. 
Moving to the right side of the page. Full year revenue was down 2.4% constant currency, in line with the guidance range of down 4% to 2%. Organic revenue was down 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, up 12.9% constant currency. Margins were 15.5%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the outlook and 2021 guidance on Slide 10. As David discussed, we provided a preliminary outlook for 2021 at our Investor Day in December. Today, we are updating the 2020 pro forma for the New Nielsen and reiterating the key elements of the preliminary outlook with 2021 guidance. As I mentioned, with shareholder approval of the sale, Connect moves into discontinued operations. So the guidance I'll discuss reflects the New Nielsen as we characterized it at our Investor Day. We continue to expect a return to organic revenue growth in 2021 compared to a decline of 1.7% for organic revenue in 2020. We forecast 3.5% to 4.5% organic revenue growth with significant improvements in both Audience Measurement and Outcomes and Content, which is how we'll refer to plan optimize on a go-forward basis, as David mentioned. We forecast constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 3%, improving from a decline of 2.3% in 2020. Organic revenue growth adjusts for the impact of the business and market exits we announced with our 2020 optimization plan. These are expected to have an approximately 150 basis point impact on 2021 revenue growth. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion as compared to pro forma 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $1.411 billion. This represents margins of 42.25% to 42.5% or 25 to 50 basis points of expansion from 2020 pro forma stand-alone margins of 42%. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, this reflects the $60 million benefit of the optimization plan to 2021 EBITDA and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return in 2021 of approximately $100 million of COVID temporary cost cuts made in 2020 as well as incremental growth investments. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.54 compared to $1.67 we earned in 2020 for the company as a whole. We will provide a reconciliation of adjusted EPS for 2020 after the discontinued operations accounting is finalized and the sale has closed. We have included related underlying guidance assumptions in the appendix as well as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS reconciliations, which should help with modeling 2021. 
There are a number of items that are significantly positive for the New Nielsen. For example, we forecast an estimated tax rate of 26% to 28%, excluding discrete items, with a greater geographic exposure to the U.S. We also forecast restructuring expense of $25 million to $35 million, which is significantly lower than historical Nielsen level. We expect to continue to delever with net debt leverage of 3.7 to 3.8x by the end of 2021. This will lower our net interest expense to a forecasted $295 million to $305 million in 2021 versus $369 million in 2020. 
And finally, our 2020 pro forma free cash flow was $555 million. While this remains preliminary and subject to change as we finalize discontinued operations treatment, it's a strong outcome, $25 million higher than our Investor Day estimate. We continue to expect free cash flow of $580 million to $630 million in 2021, excluding separation-related costs and the impact of Connect through the close. 
As discussed at Investor Day, we are focused on achieving 50% cash conversion in 2023 and double-digit compound annual free cash flow growth over the next 3 years. This free cash flow guidance does not include the impact of Connect, which typically experiences negative free cash flow in the first quarter of each year. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen bear under the Connect sale of agreement. These costs will generally be included in discontinued operations effective with our Q1 reporting, and 2021 is the last year of meaningful separation-related costs. As I mentioned earlier, certain separation-related costs planned for 2020 were deferred into early 2021. So our estimate for such costs in 2021 is now a range of $220 million to $240 million. There is some interplay between these costs, and the net proceeds on the sale of Connect, and it's worth noting that the removal of the related liability strengthens the balance sheet of the New Nielsen. 
So that's our overall 2021 guidance. And now I want to give you some context on how we see the year playing out from a timing perspective. We expect revenue growth to be faster in the second half of 2021 than in the first half with trends below our annual growth rate in the first quarter. Recall that we began to see more significant impacts of COVID beginning in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we expect the benefit of new growth initiatives to ramp as the year progresses. 
On the New Nielsen basis, we expect year-over-year margin expansion in the first half of the year with particularly strong margin expansion in Q1. The second half is a more challenging comparison, and we expect year-over-year margin contraction in the second half. We began to implement the optimization plan in the third quarter of 2020, so the incremental year-over-year benefit is more pronounced in the first half versus the second half, and we will see temporary cost return in April and later months of 2021. 
In the appendix materials, we've included a quarterly reconciliation of operating income to adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma New Nielsen basis for 2020. 
To wrap up, I'm very proud of the team's work during a difficult 2020, reacting and adapting to the pandemic. In 2021, we are laser-focused on the New Nielsen growth story. We have confidence in our path forward and are optimistic about the future of the New Nielsen. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sarah for the Q&A session."

And I understand the drivers of expanding beyond CPG and launching new products, and you mentioned a number of new client wins outside of the CPG area, which is great. But maybe it would be helpful to hear more about the go-to-market strategy within these new markets. Is the sales strategy very different versus going after a CPG client? Do you need to ramp up the sales force to reach these new industries and the small advertiser market? Are you able to do this effectively with technology and your existing sales force?"

I don't think we're going to have a big investment in sales beyond what we've already forecasted, but we are certainly investing to make sure we can cover the market on that side. 
On the Content side, again, I say we've got a big ambition around the studios, and so we've got an added effort for those as well. Inclusion Analytics was a good launch. I think it was a set of analysis that clients need right now, and we're getting good take rate on that. It's also getting us to a lot of new discussions with a broader set of the whole sort of content supply chain. So yes, we're absolutely expanding our our sales coverage, but not anything that's outside what's in the forecast."

And some of that, Jeff, I think, is also product improvement. So let me talk about demand, and then I'm going to let Karthik talk a little bit about some of the additional product enhancements that come through the year, which also give us greater confidence as we're accelerating. Listen, you're totally right, 2020 is an odd comp. And I think Linda did her best to kind of explain the ins and outs on that. I would say on Audience Measurement, it's very solid. We are seeing more demand from the digital side, and I think more digital players are wanting to participate in the big ecosystem. So I think that digital ad ratings, having it relaunched on a New Nielsen ID has been very reassuring. So we're seeing good demand there. And from some of our traditional clients, we're seeing them expand the relationships as digital becomes a bigger part of their business as well. So very solid. And as you know, we're 80% contracted going into the year. Audience Measurement is a little higher than that, so a very steady base. 
On the Outcomes side, as I just answered to Toni, we are seeing a lot of demand across various advertising categories. And I think it's been good to be out in the market on that. I think everybody is expecting privacy laws will continue to roll out that will cause cookies to get deprecated. Folks are looking for new answers. And our ability to resolve identity and do better outcomes measurement is really helping people do targeting at scale. So -- and that's important to a lot of different advertising categories. 
And then on the Content side, I would say, the early days, but we're building good relationships with the studios. On the other side, the platforms all want to improve their experience and the metadata we provide really does help. The consumer wave through just unbelievable libraries of content to find what she is interested in. So it's got a growing demand because I think the move to streaming has just raised the game for people wanting to do good user experiences and good recommendation engines. 
Karthik, if you want to comment a little bit on a couple of the key product milestones that are also driving demand, that would be helpful."

So I think in terms of writing upfront contracts that that may be 22 versus '21. However, components are going to be used right now in Q1 and certainly in May as people kind of make commitments for the next year. 
When I said they're using the capabilities, I would say, as Karthik just said, they're clearly using the new generation of digital ad ratings, and that being on the Nielsen ID does allow some reconciliation. They're also clearly using some of the reporting to be able to better understand behavior across broadcast and streaming together. Streaming video ratings are out and people are using those, and connected TV and addressable is being used and continuing to get deployed amongst more folks. So the components are there, and people are using those components. There is more components to come in the second half, including mobile, including more big data in national TV, including sub-minute, which is really important. So we'll continue to report every quarter as the modules roll out and they get adoption. But in terms of a full currency swap, I think that's something that will start in '22 when all the components are coming on line."

I think there has been a growing enthusiasm around the road map on Nielsen One and getting really tangible what's available when. Keep in mind, right now, we're signing MSAs that might be for several years into the future. And the discussion has been more forward-looking about how our clients' business models are evolving and how our measurement is evolving with them. 
Similarly, on the demand side, on the advertisers and agencies, I think there's been a lot of focus across the economy and being more effective and more efficient. There, I think, there's certainly also enthusiasm for a more simple and scalable approach to measurement. But having the Audience Measurement connect to the Outcomes Measurement off from a shared Nielsen ID getting to a single platform has really generated a lot of energy for the subscriptions we'll see on the buying side of the ad market as well.

And there's a difference between those 2 because targeting is about scale. For measurement, it's about getting the persistency and consistency of the demos because we can have different campaigns with different outcomes around age and gender as an example. So our ID system is exclusively built for that. It leverages, obviously, the Nielsen panel and the validations are really good. And so the key for us is we're trying to connect everything ultimately from an exposure perspective to a person. And so if you eliminate the role of cookies, we work directly with the sync essentially, where you can then collect advertiser information and then plug that back into our ID platform. So that again, connecting back to a person. So the trick here is cookies collect -- or used to collect a whole bunch of different attributes. We're only collecting the attributes that help assign a person to this. And take away sort of the devices against that. And so it all builds it back to a person. That's the sort of starting point with real privacy safe attributes for that person. And then you can break it down for whatever device underpins that user. And so the trick for us here is the more pervasive it gets in the industry, and that's why we partner with a few players here. That helps ease of use and it really accelerates the industry to live without cookies going into the next chapter of digital. So we're super excited about this and obviously, super excited that more of our capabilities are getting on to using the ID. Not just reach a frequency, which is Audience Measurement, but also moving towards Outcomes through yesterday's attribution announcement."

So David, I think this is ultimately kind of a question about how you sell your product these days, but also how your products are evolving at the same time. And maybe a part for you and maybe a part for Karthik, but what I really want to ask is about sort of the next 3 to 6 months. And usually, the upfront new front season was typically a time where Nielsen was educating the market on product iterations. I know if I go back and look at your product road map from the Investor Day, it still looks like we've got some things coming in that sort of period, specifically, and you highlighted mobile a moment ago. At the same time, the importance of the upfront is changing and evolving and other issues like, for example, what Apple is going to sort of rollout here in March and how that may affect some of the changes in your products and the evolution of the products or, for example, what's going on with chrome and the privacy sandbox. So again, what I'm kind of asking about is how you sell and also how you adjust to what you're learning about how the ecosystem is evolving at the same time?"

I think both buyers and sellers, I think, are having more constant conversations. I think there are still points at which people will make commitments, and we'll support that, but we certainly have already adapted to more of an always-on engagement process here to help folks move forward. So in terms of the next 3 to 6 months and certainly throughout '21, I would say we're starting with real clear product road maps that new capabilities are needed, and they're coming to the market. And I think that had a very increased level of engagement with individual advertisers, individual agencies, individual platforms and individual networks, but also collectively with the industry as a whole. So certainly, working with the MRC on how we're going to accredit all of that and make sure there's audit trails, which is important and which need to be rethought because you're measuring more things. And you're doing -- you're using new methods, but also with the world federation of advertisers, the association national advertisers on their measurement teams and them joining the Nielsen One team, engaging with the agencies through the forays and its counterparts around the world and certainly sort of engagement with all the publishers and platforms. And I think as the whole market is adapting to a very different audience behavior. And certainly, the audience has discovered lots of new ways to access content during the pandemic, and that was going to stick. So I think our -- helping everybody see what we're seeing see the total market, not just their own platforms, is helping folks make bigger decisions. So that increases our value we're engaged with those and that also opens new selling opportunities. Because we're finding needs that we -- people didn't even know we could solve. Particularly on the outcome side, I think the demand is growing as folks are really looking at how they're going to adapt to a world where you may not have all the same data, as you said, you mentioned Apple, but on any is there or any mobile device, you're not going to necessarily have the same data you had before, having Nielsen be able to federate and sync up all those IDs, really helps them maintain control of their businesses. So the short answer is we're selling with more conversations and then that's opening the door to more opportunities and more value."

In the core, at least an Investor Day, local in and the reason we see it returning to flat is that we have seen price stability we have continued adoption. And we've seen validation that while there are other ways to measure local, they're not all accredited. They're not all rigorous. They're not getting the same rating system and same panel validation, which is, I think, differential. And so in large where the money is, I think that the Nielsen value proposition is and the same for audio. And even though audio has certainly had to deal with the pandemic and the fact that people were not in their cars as much, I think they all found that Nielsen is pretty important to protecting their value. So that said, I would model it at flat. [indiscernible] again folks begin to use us on the attribution side, in terms of being able to show the return on investment. We've done that with sort of market analysis in audio for a while. One of the recent wins was Spotify, and I think Spotify figuring out how to actually do more attribution of this platform is indicative of where all the sort of new streaming audio players need to be. So there's certainly opportunity, but I do want to just be transparent that in aggregate, we think that part of our business will be flat in '21 and probably '22 as well."

And obviously, all of these partners came to us because they believe in what we are doing from an overall Nielsen One road map. So that's exciting. 
And then there's also all the other addressable components. So think of all addressable on MVPD and cable. That inventory, again, you could argue for a long time has been out there for Nielsen to measure and include into the overall linear TV rating system. So that's on the docket as well. So these are just a few, but there's a whole bunch of, I'd say, innovations built off of the consistent Nielsen One methodology that will continue to play through over the next couple of years."

Really in 2 different ways. Karthik, I was hoping maybe from you, so we've all been conditioned to live in sort of an instant gratification world when us and investors think about time lines out to '22 and 24. It sort of begs the question, that seems like a lot of years. And so we know there's a lot going on, a lot you need to deliver and a lot that your customers need in terms of seeing the data and seeing concurrent history of data, so they can make guarantees on it. I just wonder if there's anything you're contemplating that could do some of that in parallel or speed up that time line, which gets to the other part of the question, maybe more for David or Karthik, which is the world isn't going to stop in the meantime. So what's the risk that publishers and advertisers between now and then just find a way to do their business, and that gets ingrained. And by the time Nielsen One gets there, people have moved on. Any thoughts?  Appreciate it."

I'd say one of the main reasons our road map is not a wait and see and designed around launching consistent components that build up to Nielsen One. That's the way we want to think about it. So one simple example is, if you think about what's the most important piece in the end for Nelson One is to have a set of consistent, comparable metrics, right? And so everything we're doing on connected TV, digital, you name it, is all like built off of this vision to get to a consistent metric. And on the linear side, the most important piece there is to really address the C3 currency, which is an average commercial minute, right? So we're revamping the entire system to be able to get C3 to B also, I'd say, the same equivalency as digital is. So by seconds, not by minutes, right? So these 2 things are happening at the same time, and we want to start putting data out for what sub-minute information looks like on linear, so that the market starts to understand what it is to look at a currency that used to be ads and content just as one thing. We're going to start to split that out, get people comfortable with the granularity. So that as we keep building towards driving consistency across metrics, people are familiar. The biggest change is obviously going to be in the linear side, right? Like that's no surprise because it's the sort of oldest metric on the table. So putting data out that separate cloud ads from content And also what does the granularity look like, how does that affect the metrics, that will really help the market understand. So when we start putting all the pieces together at the end of sort of 2022, so that the market can start to see it, everyone's sort of familiar with what to expect. So there's a ramp here, but there's again, monetizable components, built with a consistency and a vision towards this comparable [Audio Gap]"

We have an exciting year ahead with strong momentum built off solid execution in 2020. 
I hope that you were all able to attend our Investor Day in December, where we laid out a detailed plan to maximize shareholder value for the New Nielsen. We refer to the New Nielsen as what our company will look like pro forma after the pending sale of Connect. Following the sale, Nielsen will be the must-have data and analytics provider for the entire media ecosystem.
Let me remind you of the 3 key messages from Investor Day. First, we are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets, and we are doing this globally; second, we are undergoing a cultural shift with a growth-driven mindset; and third, we have a compelling financial model, reflective of a leading data and analytics company. 
I'm going to lead off with the last point: our compelling financial model, as shown by the resiliency of our business in 2020 and our improving financial profile. Our guidance issued today is consistent with the preliminary 2021 outlook we provided at Investor Day, and our confidence in our ability to deliver this has only grown since December. Linda will provide greater detail later in the call, but I want to review our 2021 outlook at a high level.
We expect 3.5% to 4.5% organic revenue growth. We are laying the path to achieve our medium-term goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We'll see margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points with 150 basis points of total margin expansion expected through 2023, and we expect free cash flow of $580 million to $630 million for the New Nielsen. We remain focused on achieving free cash flow conversion of 50% which will help drive free cash flow above $800 million by 2023, and we are also forecasting adjusted EPS of $1.43 to $1.54. 
And finally, our balance sheet will improve as we pay down approximately $2 billion of our debt from our agreement to sell Nielsen Connect to Advent International. We received shareholder approval for the sale at our special shareholder meeting in February with 99% of the shareholders who voted voting in favor of the transaction. We are making good progress on the other necessary approvals and customary closing conditions, and we expect this transaction to close within the next 90 days. Our confidence in our growth forecast starts with the strong foundation we laid in 2019 and 2020, including our cultural shift to a growth-driven mindset.
2020 was obviously a challenging year given the global pandemic, but Nielsen adapted incredibly well. I am proud of all that we accomplished, and I want to thank each and every one of my Nielsen colleagues for their resilience, courage and focus.
While our 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the pandemic, we still delivered adjusted EBITDA and EPS within the pre-COVID initial guidance range we provided you at this time last year, and free cash flow was above the initial range. We achieved these results by quickly adapting and evolving throughout the organization, especially in the field, our call centers and our products.
Importantly, our actions were not just temporary reactions to the COVID pandemic. We created permanent structural improvements by enacting our optimization plan midyear. We rationalized the product portfolio with a focus on essential, higher-margin syndicated businesses. We also simplified the underlying technology and data science around 2 unique global platforms, one for audience and one for content, which will drive faster and bolder innovation in 2021 and beyond, taking advantage of the rapid media ecosystem evolution that has only accelerated over the past year.
Finally, we strengthened our leadership team and our Board of Directors. Together, we are driving the cultural shift to a growth mindset across the entire organization, led by our diverse leadership team. I want to add that our increased focus on diversity, equity and inclusion was essential to achieving our solid 2020 results. We focused on every member of the Nielsen team being able to feel safe and supported this year, and this helped our people show up in amazing ways. We have also focused on being an inclusive business, and we see great value from insisting that all of our partners share our accountability to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
We've discussed our compelling financial model and our cultural transformation. Now let me address the final key message from Investor Day. The New Nielsen is driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets worldwide. I'll walk you through our 3 essential solutions: Audience Measurement, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services. 
Starting with Audience Measurement. In December, we announced the planned launch of Nielsen ONE, our new cross-media measurement solution. Nielsen ONE evolves the Nielsen ratings to a single measurement solution for both streaming and broadcast consumption. This is an enormous innovation for Nielsen and for the media industry. It's a transformative move that is critical to the future of the media ecosystem.
The industry's critical need was validated by clients at our Nielsen ONE launch event, where industry leaders, such as Unilever, Mastercard, NBC, Google and GroupM and others, discussed the need for a single currency across streaming and broadcast. If you weren't able to attend the virtual launch, I recommend watching the replay, which is available on our website. These and other companies are also actively involved now in the Advisory Committees for Nielsen ONE. We are starting up 2021 with clear proof points that we are advancing on our cross-media vision. At Investor Day, we laid out the road map for the major components of Nielsen ONE through 2022. We are delivering, as planned, on these interim milestones toward the Nielsen ONE launch today, and clients are already using our new capabilities.
Our cross-media measurement solution has 3 fundamental principles at its core: resiliency, coverage and comparability, and we are making good progress across all 3 principles. Let me provide you some color. First, resiliency is built through more data sources. In Q4, we announced strategic data partnerships with VIZIO, DIRECTV and DISH to unlock addressable measurement. This builds on the existing relationships we have in place for local measurement, the return path data we ingest from Comcast, Charter, DISH and DIRECTV. Of course, there is noise and biases in big data alone, which is why our gold standard Nielsen panels are essential to clean and correct this data. We are strengthening our resiliency by upgrading our panel to include streaming meters and an advanced nanometer across the entire base. We recently met our initial goal of 10,000 streaming meters, and we expect to have streaming meters in 100% of panelist homes as we refresh the panel over the next 24 months or so.
Second, coverage. We are expanding our connected TV footprint, as we said we would, with the addition of YouTube, YouTube TV and VIZIO, and we'll work to further this. We've also recently expanded coverage of streaming to include the viewing of movie releases that are directly available to consumers through streaming or MVPD platforms. For the first time, we released viewership data for Warner Media's HBO Max streaming platform for their blockbuster, Wonder Woman 1984.
The third principle, comparability, is enabled by all of our measurement solutions being built off a single Nielsen Audience ID. This ID was built in 2020 and successfully tested in Q4, as planned. The ID allows us to deduplicate metrics and ensure that we have one view of reach and frequency across both broadcast and streaming signals. In January of 2021, we implemented the new measurement methodology for Digital Ad Ratings, which is our flagship digital offering. And I'm also proud to announce that we were recently recognized by the media industry with an Emmy Award for our technology innovation to measure video viewing across a multi-platform service, technology that's core to Nielsen ONE. 
And finally, I want to remind you that Nielsen ONE is a global vision. Any new markets, such as last year's wins in Denmark and Saudi Arabia, will be on the Nielsen ONE solution, and we will convert the rest of our markets over the next 2 to 3 years.
Let me turn to Plan/Optimize. This is where our 2 other essential solutions, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services, are housed. Given the portfolio rationalization we did in the 2020 optimization plan, we will now start referring to Plan/Optimize as outcomes and content, which is more precisely descriptive of the remaining products and services. 
Starting with Audience Outcomes. We are one of the largest outcomes measurement providers in the media ecosystem globally, helping clients plan their cross-media spend and answer questions like, ""Did the viewer visit the dealership or buy the product online?"" We already do this today, but we have the opportunity to accelerate outcomes growth with new clients, new syndicatable products built on a single platform and connecting our cross-media measurement to outcomes which is the key only at Nielsen differentiator. 
A key element of our growth strategy is further expanding in verticals beyond consumer packaged goods, which are currently the vast majority of our advertiser clients yet represent only 10% of the world's ad spend. We have recently organized our sales teams to better focus on end markets, such as financial services, insurance, pharmaceuticals, automotive, retail, digital brands and technology, and this has already driven new client wins across these verticals. In fact, at Investor Day, we mentioned success with a number of leading brands, such as Visa, Equifax, Petco, Volkswagen and LVMH. We've expanded with LVMH to now include their Bulgari division, and we've added new clients, such as Spotify, Flipkart and others. These wins span both the U.S. and international markets. Our progress is underpinned by our technology transformation, which is helping to shorten turnaround time, bring on new clients faster and accelerate product innovation. Earlier this month, we announced our new ID resolution methodology for attribution, which enables advertisers and publishers to understand the entire consumer journey across platforms, better optimize their spend and prove the impact of advertising, even if cookies go away. 
Finally, let me turn to Gracenote Content Services. As you may remember, Gracenote is the market leader in entertainment metadata. We power the consumer entertainment experience on a truly global basis. For example, Gracenote provides detailed information on movies and TV shows that you see on your cable program guides or discover on your streaming services. Gracenote also provides real-time sports score statistics for the world's top leagues, events, teams and players to use in their audience experience. Gracenote is deployed in over 120 million cars worldwide, providing data through car entertainment systems. And Gracenote's information on artists and songs powers music services and consumer electronics brands. Gracenote metadata is the de facto standard across the entertainment industry. Virtually, every consumer interacts with Gracenote metadata multiple times in any given day. 
We are focused on 3 key growth opportunities for Gracenote Content Services. First, more audiences, content, markets and platforms means that there are more opportunities for our core Gracenote metadata services. We're growing our substantial base by adding new platforms, markets and content and increasing the capacity and speed of our ability to grow metadata. We have been building our global leadership position with key industry players, such as Comcast, Samsung, Google and Liberty Global. 
Second, we're developing new solutions for new products across discovery, marketing and insights. For example, last week, we launched Gracenote inclusion analytics to accelerate diversity and content and enable clients to create more resonant programming backed by our data-driven analytics. 
And third, we have a bold ambition for Gracenote. Gracenote can help studios leverage the Gracenote content ID to attach a unique identifier to their content which will serve to simplify and scale the distribution and discovery of content across the full range of channels and streaming services used by audiences today. 
To sum up, we are excited about the opportunities ahead in 2021 and beyond. We have a compelling financial model. We are shifting our culture to that of a growth mindset, and we are executing on key initiatives to drive accelerating growth through new solutions and new clients. Building on our progress in 2020, we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the 2021 plan and to deliver our medium-term targets. We are indeed a New Nielsen, strongly positioned for the future and ready to deliver enhanced value to our clients and to our shareholders.
I'm now happy to turn the call over to Linda to review the financials and provide greater detail on our 2021 guidance. Linda?"

As David highlighted, the fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid performance and financial resilience during an unprecedented time due to the global pandemic. Before I review the results, let me",2214,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As David highlighted, the fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid performance and financial resilience during an unprecedented time due to the global pandemic. 
Before I review the results, let me reflect on the meaningful accomplishments in 2020. First, when it became clear that COVID was going to have a global impact on our revenue, we focused on quickly adapting to ensure the continuity of our business processes and to mitigate potential impact. We also took swift action in late Q1 to lower cost by at least $200 million in 2020, including approximately $100 million in media. These were temporary cuts that do return this year. Our resilient business model and highly contracted business gave us visibility into 2020 despite the uncertainty of the pandemic, and we were able to continue to provide guidance and deliver strong results.
Second, we began to execute the optimization plan announced in July, which includes $250 million of annualized run rate permanent cost savings in the second half of 2020 and beyond, split roughly evenly between Media and Connect. We've executed well and realized about half of the savings in 2020 with the balance expected in 2021. The temporary cost cuts and the optimization plan drove strong margin expansion in the second half of 2020 but will result in tougher comps for EBITDA and margin in the second half of 2021.
Third, we were active in the debt markets in 2020, successfully refinancing approximately $3 billion of debt with 5- to 10-year maturity. We ended 2020 at 4.09x net leverage, in line with our expectation. 
And finally, we announced the planned sale of Connect and a few weeks later hosted an Investor Day. Given the February 11 shareholder approval of the sale, we will begin reporting Connect as a discontinued operations beginning with the first quarter results. Today's 2020 commentary will cover Media and Connect, consistent with our prior reporting.
With that as a backdrop for what we accomplished in a busy 2020, let me now turn to our financial results. I'll start with Slide 6 to review the fourth quarter and full year 2020. We achieved or exceeded our revised 2020 guidance across all key measures. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.8% in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year, in line with our guidance of down 4% to 2%. On an organic basis, revenue declined 2% in the fourth quarter and 3.1% for the year. COVID continued to impact the fourth quarter, though at a slightly lesser pace than in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $560 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.5%, up 458 basis points in constant currency. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $1.882 billion, up 2.7% constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA was towards the high end of the original pre-COVID guidance we provided last February of $1.830 billion to $1.910 billion. For the year, revenue was down $208 million, while costs were down $237 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.9%. Margins were up 147 basis points on a constant currency basis and towards the high end of the 29.5% to 30% guidance range. The temporary and permanent cost savings drove significant margin expansion in the second half of the year in both Media and Connect. 
Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.53 compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2019 on higher EBITDA, offset, in part, by higher taxes. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.67 compared to $1.80 in 2019, above our guidance range of $1.54 to a $1.62. As compared to the prior year, the $1.67 adjusted EPS reflects higher EBITDA, lower interest expense and tax favorability, which was more than offset by higher depreciation and amortization.
Our effective tax rate was 41% in the fourth quarter and 90% for the full year, albeit on low full year pretax income of $74 million. A number of our tax costs are more fixed than variable in nature and can therefore have an outsized impact on the tax rate when pretax results are low. Adjusting for the discrete items, our tax rate would have been approximately 33% in 2020 after also adjusting book income for the impairment charges. 
We incurred $131 million in impairment charges in Q4 related to the value of Connect's trade name and internally developed software, mostly related to Connect. We exclude these charges from adjusted EPS. 
We ended the year with $144 million of restructuring expenses, slightly below our forecast as we gained efficiencies on our restructuring plan.
Turning to free cash flow. We generated $598 million of free cash flow in 2020, up from $547 million in 2019 and above the high end of our initial pre-COVID guidance range of by $580 million and our updated guidance range of $550 million. These results include $118 million of separation-related cash payments in 2020, which was lower than our prior expectations as some larger pension and tax payments shifted into 2021. Key drivers of the year-over-year free cash flow improvement include higher EBITDA, lower cash taxes, lower interest expense and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher restructuring and working capital. Despite the pandemic, cash collections remained solid throughout 2020.
Now let's turn to the segment results. On Slide 7, I'll review the Media segment results, starting with the Q4 results on the left. Revenue for Q4 was $872 million, down 2.6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or down 1.8% organic. While we continue to see ongoing impact from COVID, performance in the quarter was ahead of our expectations. 
Audience Measurement revenue declined 0.2% constant currency and grew 0.2% on an organic basis. We continue to see pressure in local television and COVID-related pressure in sports and ad hoc products. 
Plan/Optimize revenues declined 8.1% constant currency in the fourth quarter with organic revenue down 6.5%. This adjusts for exits and the Q4 '19 divestiture of our music business. COVID continued to impact sports, Gracenote Auto and short-cycle revenue. Despite the revenue decline, Media's Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $393 million, up 4% constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.1% were up 284 basis points in constant currency. 
Moving to the right side of the page. Full year revenue was down 2.3% constant currency, in line with the guidance range of down 3% to 2%. Organic revenue was down 1.7%. Audience Measurement revenue declined 0.5% with organic revenue down 0.3%. Plan/Optimize revenue declined 6.7% constant currency for the full year with organic revenue down 5.2%. 
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $1.474 billion, which is roughly flat on a constant currency basis compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 43.9%, up 94 basis points year-over-year, supported by the temporary and permanent cost-savings initiatives we discussed, offset, in part, by investments in growth initiatives.
Turning to Slide 8. I'll discuss high-level results for the Connect segment, starting with Q4 results on the left side of the page. Fourth quarter revenue was $800 million, down 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue was down 2.3%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $176 million was up 41.9% on a constant currency basis. Margins of 22% were up an impressive 663 basis points constant currency. 
Moving to the right side of the page. Full year revenue was down 2.4% constant currency, in line with the guidance range of down 4% to 2%. Organic revenue was down 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, up 12.9% constant currency. Margins were 15.5%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to the outlook and 2021 guidance on Slide 10. As David discussed, we provided a preliminary outlook for 2021 at our Investor Day in December. Today, we are updating the 2020 pro forma for the New Nielsen and reiterating the key elements of the preliminary outlook with 2021 guidance. 
As I mentioned, with shareholder approval of the sale, Connect moves into discontinued operations. So the guidance I'll discuss reflects the New Nielsen as we characterized it at our Investor Day. We continue to expect a return to organic revenue growth in 2021 compared to a decline of 1.7% for organic revenue in 2020. We forecast 3.5% to 4.5% organic revenue growth with significant improvements in both Audience Measurement and outcomes and content, which is how we'll refer to Plan/Optimize on a go-forward basis, as David mentioned. 
We forecast constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 3%, improving from a decline of 2.3% in 2020. Organic revenue growth adjusts for the impact of the business and market exits we announced with our 2020 optimization plan. These are expected to have an approximately 150 basis point impact on 2021 revenue growth. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of $1.460 billion to $1.480 billion as compared to pro forma 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $1.411 billion. This represents margins of 42.25% to 42.5% or 25 to 50 basis points of expansion from 2020 pro forma standalone margins of 42%. As we discussed at Investor Day, this reflects the $60 million benefit of the optimization plan to 2021 EBITDA and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return in 2021 of approximately $100 million of COVID temporary cost cuts made in 2020 as well as incremental growth investments.
Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.54 compared to $1.67 we earned in 2020 for the company as a whole. We will provide a reconciliation of adjusted EPS for 2020 after the discontinued operations accounting is finalized and the sale has closed. We have included related underlying guidance assumptions in the appendix as well as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS reconciliations which should help with modeling 2021. 
There are a number of items that are significantly positive for the New Nielsen. For example, we forecast an estimated tax rate of 26% to 28%, excluding discrete items, with a greater geographic exposure to the U.S. We also forecast restructuring expense of $25 million to $35 million, which is significantly lower than historical Nielsen level. We expect to continue to delever with net debt leverage of 3.7 to 3.8x by the end of 2021. This will lower our net interest expense to a forecasted $295 million to $305 million in 2021 versus $369 million in 2020.
And finally, our 2020 pro forma free cash flow was $555 million. While this remains preliminary and subject to change as we finalize discontinued operations treatment, it's a strong outcome, $25 million higher than our Investor Day estimate. We continue to expect free cash flow of $580 million to $630 million in 2021, excluding separation-related costs and the impact of Connect through the close.
As discussed at Investor Day, we are focused on achieving 50% cash conversion in 2023 and double-digit compound annual free cash flow growth over the next 3 years. This free cash flow guidance does not include the impact of Connect, which typically experiences negative free cash flow in the first quarter of each year. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen bears under the Connect sale of agreement. These costs will generally be included in discontinued operations effective with our Q1 reporting, and 2021 is the last year of meaningful separation-related costs.
As I mentioned earlier, certain separation-related costs planned for 2020 were deferred into early 2021, so our estimate for such costs in 2021 is now a range of $220 million to $240 million. There is some interplay between these costs, and the net proceeds on the sale of Connect, and it's worth noting that the removal of the related liability strengthens the balance sheet of the New Nielsen. 
So that's our overall 2021 guidance. And now I want to give you some context on how we see the year playing out from a timing perspective. We expect revenue growth to be faster in the second half of 2021 than in the first half with trends below our annual growth rate in the first quarter. Recall that we began to see more significant impacts of COVID beginning in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we expect the benefit of new growth initiatives to ramp as the year progresses. 
On the New Nielsen basis, we expect year-over-year margin expansion in the first half of the year with particularly strong margin expansion in Q1. The second half faces a more challenging comparison, and we expect year-over-year margin contraction in the second half. We began to implement the optimization plan in the third quarter of 2020, so the incremental year-over-year benefit is more pronounced in the first half versus the second half, and we will see temporary costs return in April and later months of 2021. In the appendix of our materials, we've included a quarterly reconciliation of operating income to adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma New Nielsen basis for 2020. 
To wrap up, I'm very proud of the team's work during a difficult 2020, reacting and adapting to the pandemic. In 2021, we are laser focused on the New Nielsen growth story. We have confidence in our path forward and are optimistic about the future of the New Nielsen. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sara for the Q&A session."

And I understand the drivers of expanding beyond CPG and launching new products, and you mentioned a number of new client wins outside of the CPG area, which is great. But maybe it would be helpful to hear more about the go-to-market strategy within these new markets. Is the sales strategy very different versus going after a CPG client? Do you need to ramp up the sales force to reach these new industries and the small advertiser market? Or are you able to do this effectively with technology and your existing sales force?"

We've also brought in a new Head of Marketing and Communications, and Jamie is building her team to make sure we're doing good lead generation into that team. 
I do think, over time, some of what we do in outcomes can be bought directly online. It won't take a big sales effort. To be clear, we're not done with that yet, but we're also looking at sort of channel expansion. I don't think we're going to have a big investment in sales beyond what we've already forecasted, but we are certainly investing to make sure we can cover the market on that side.
On the content side, again, I say we've got a big ambition around the studios, and so we've got an added effort for those as well. Inclusion Analytics was a good launch. I think it was a set of analysis that clients need right now, and we're getting good take rate on that. It's also getting us to a lot of new discussions with a broader set of the whole sort of content supply chain. So yes, we're absolutely expanding our sales coverage but not anything that's outside what's in the forecast."

And some of that, Jeff, I think, is also product improvement. So let me talk about demand, and then I'm going to let Karthik talk a little bit about some of the additional product enhancements that come through the year which also give us greater confidence as we're accelerating. Listen, you're totally right, 2020 is an odd comp, and I think Linda did her best to kind of explain the ins and outs on that. 
I would say on Audience Measurement, it's very solid. We are seeing more demand from the digital side, and I think more digital players are wanting to participate in the big ecosystem. So I think that Digital Ad Ratings, having it relaunched on a New Nielsen ID, has been very reassuring. So we're seeing good demand there. And from some of our traditional clients, we're seeing them expand the relationships as digital becomes a bigger part of their business as well, so very solid. And as you know, we're 80% contracted going into the year. Audience Measurement is a little higher than that, so a very steady base. 
On the outcomes side, as I just answered to Toni, we are seeing a lot of demand across various advertising categories, and I think it's been good to be out in the market on that. I think everybody is expecting privacy laws will continue to roll out that will cause cookies to get deprecated. Folks are looking for new answers, and our ability to resolve identity and do better outcomes measurement is really helping people do targeting at scale. So -- and that's important to a lot of different advertising categories. 
And then on the content side, I would say the -- early days, but we're building good relationships with the studios. On the other side, the platforms all want to improve their experience, and the metadata we provide really does help. The consumer wave through just unbelievable libraries of content to find what she is interested in, so it's got a growing demand because I think the move to streaming has just raised the game for people wanting to do good user experiences and good recommendation engines.
Karthik, if you want to comment a little bit on a couple of the key product milestones that are also driving demand, that would be helpful. Thanks."

As you've seen, we've launched identity as the underpinning for the new attribution capability. So there's a lot of things that are getting on to the Nielsen platform as we execute. But more importantly, they're also monetizable and therefore connected to our revenue plan and the pacing of the revenue plans. So a lot of exciting stuff coming up, obviously, not just since the January launch.

And then certainly, I think it's '22 before you get to the point that it's going to be a full and simple currency. So I think in terms of writing upfront contracts, that may be 22 versus '21. However, components are going to be used right now in Q1 and certainly in May as people kind of make commitments for the next year. 
When I said they're using the capabilities, I would say, as Karthik just said, they're clearly using the new generation of Digital Ad Ratings, and that being on Nielsen ID does allow some reconciliation. They're also clearly using some of the reporting to be able to better understand behavior across broadcast and streaming together. Streaming video ratings are out and people are using those, and connected TV and addressable is being used and continuing to get deployed amongst more folks. 
So the components are there, and people are using those components. There is more components to come in the second half, including mobile, including more big data in national TV, including sub-minute, which is really important. So we'll continue to report every quarter as the modules roll out and they get adoption. But in terms of a full currency swap, I think that's something that will start in '22 when all the components are coming online."

I think there has been a growing enthusiasm around the road map on Nielsen ONE and getting really tangible what's available when. Keep in mind, right now, we're signing MSAs that might be for several years into the future, and the discussion has been more forward-looking about how our clients' business models are evolving and how our measurement is evolving with them.
Similarly, on the demand side, on the advertisers and agencies, I think there's been a lot of focus across the economy and being more effective and more efficient. There, I think, there's certainly also enthusiasm for a more simple and scalable approach to measurement. But having the Audience Measurement connect to the outcomes measurement off from a shared Nielsen ID getting to a single platform has really generated a lot of energy for the subscriptions we'll see on the buying side of the ad market as well.

And there's a difference between those 2 because targeting is about scale. For measurement, it's about getting the persistency and consistency of the demos because we can have different campaigns with different outcomes around age and gender as an example. So our ID system is exclusively built for that. It leverages, obviously, the Nielsen panel, and the validations are really good. And so the key for us is we're trying to connect everything ultimately from an exposure perspective to a person. And so if you eliminate the role of cookies, we work directly with the sync, essentially, where you can then collect advertiser information and then plug that back into our ID platform, so again, connecting back to a person. 
So the trick here is cookies collect -- or used to collect a whole bunch of different attributes. We're only collecting the attributes that help assign a person to this and take away sort of the devices against that. And so it all builds it back to a person. That's the sort of starting point with real privacy safe attributes for that person, and then you can break it down for whatever device underpins that user. 
And so the trick for us here is the more pervasive it gets in the industry, and that's why we partner with a few players here, that helps ease of use and it really accelerates the industry to live without cookies going into the next chapter of digital. So we're super excited about this and obviously, super excited that more of our capabilities are getting on to using the ID, not just reach a frequency, which is Audience Measurement, but also moving towards outcomes through yesterday's attribution announcement."

And usually, the upfront new front season was typically a time where Nielsen was educating the market on product iterations. I know if I go back and look at your product road map from the Investor Day, it still looks like we've got some things coming in that sort of period, specifically and you highlighted mobile a moment ago. At the same time, the importance of the upfront is changing and evolving and other issues like, for example, what Apple is going to sort of roll out here in March and how that may affect some of the changes in your products and the evolution of the products or, for example, what's going on with Chrome and the Privacy Sandbox. So again, what I'm kind of asking about is how you sell and also how you adjust to what you're learning about how the ecosystem is evolving at the same time."

So certainly, working with the MRC on how we're going to accredit all of that and make sure there's audit trails which is important and which need to be rethought because you're measuring more things, and you're doing -- you're using new methods, but also with the World Federation of Advertisers, the Association of National Advertisers on their measurement teams and them joining the Nielsen ONE team, engaging with the agencies through the forays and its counterparts around the world and certainly sort of engagement with all the publishers and platforms. 
And I think as the whole market is adapting to a very different audience behavior. And certainly, the audience has discovered lots of new ways to access content during the pandemic, and that was going to stick. So I think our -- helping everybody see what we're seeing -- see the total market, not just their own platforms, is helping folks make bigger decisions. 
So that increases our value. We're engaged with those, and that also opens new selling opportunities because we're finding needs that we -- people didn't even know we could solve. Particularly on the outcome side, I think the demand is growing as folks are really looking at how they're going to adapt to a world where you may not have all the same data, as you said. You mentioned Apple, but on any browser or any mobile device, you're not going to necessarily have the same data you had before. Having Nielsen be able to federate and sync up all those IDs really helps them maintain control of their businesses. So the short answer is we're selling with more conversations, and then that's opening the door to more opportunities and more value."

And within there, maybe you can also just help us think about -- one of your competitors, obviously, just brought in some new capital, some new partners. They tend to be going after that market fairly aggressively. I'm just kind of -- again, maybe you could size and just tell us how you're thinking about that business? 
And then similarly, on audio, again, if you can size and just help us how to think about that in that medium-term outlook? Again, does that decline? Or do you have plans to address digital and/or podcast in a more aggressive way? Any color there would be great."

Obviously, in audio, there is a growing streaming component as well. And I think the local television side is also finding sort of the digital extension of their brands, and we're helping them with that. 
In the core, as we said, I think, in Investor Day, local is returning to flat, and the reason we see it returning to flat is that we have seen price stability. We have seen continued adoption, and quite honestly, I think we've seen validation that while there are other ways to measure local, they're not all accredited. They're not all rigorous. They're not using the same rating system and same panel validation, which is, I think, differential. 
And so in larger DNAs where the money is, I think that the Nielsen value proposition is super strong and the same for audio. And even though audio has certainly had to deal with the pandemic and the fact that people were not in their cars as much, I think they all found that Nielsen is pretty important to protecting their value. 
So that said, I would model it at flat. It's certainly not growing at the rate of the rest of the business. And within that, there is also gives and takes. stronger players that have more ambitious agendas around digital are using Nielsen more. We're also seeing folks begin to use us on the attribution side, in terms of being able to show the return on investment. We've done that with sort of market analysis in audio for a while. One of the recent wins was Spotify. And I think Spotify, figuring out how to actually do more attribution off this platform, is indicative of where all the sort of new streaming audio players need to be. So there's certainly opportunity, but I do want to just be transparent that, in aggregate, we think that part of our business will be flat in '21 and probably '22 as well."

So again, going back to -- when we think of coverage, it's a really important component. The most exciting things that get lit up towards the middle of the year are all of the connected TV integrations. And we covered who they are in Investor Day, so I won't go through that. But the reason this is important is because it creates new monetization capability for all of that inventory. It's a very rapidly growing space, and this is new for Nielsen. And obviously, all of these partners came to us because they believe in what we are doing from an overall Nielsen ONE road map. So that's exciting. 
And then there's also all the other addressable components. So think of all addressable on MVPD and cable, that inventory, again, you could argue for a long time has been out there for Nielsen to measure and include into the overall linear TV rating system. So that's on the docket as well. So these are just a few, but there's a whole bunch of, I'd say, innovations built off of the consistent Nielsen ONE methodology that will continue to play through over the next couple of years."

I'd say one of the main reasons our road map is not a wait and see and designed around launching consistent components that build up to Nielsen ONE, that's the way we want to think about it. 
So one simple example is if you think about what's the most important piece in the end for Nielsen ONE is to have a set of consistent, comparable metrics, right? And so everything we're doing on connected TV, digital, you name it, is all like built off of this vision to get to a consistent metric. 
And on the linear side, the most important piece there is to really address the C3 currency, which is an average commercial minute, right? So we're revamping the entire system to be able to get C3 to B also, I'd say, the same equivalency as digital is, so by seconds, not by minutes, right? 
So these 2 things are happening at the same time, and we want to start putting data out for what sub-minute information looks like on linear, so that the market starts to understand what it is to look at a currency that used to be ads and content just as one thing. We're going to start to split that out, get people comfortable with the granularity so that as we keep building towards driving consistency across metrics, people are familiar. 
The biggest change is obviously going to be in the linear side, right? Like that's no surprise because it's the sort of oldest metric on the table. So putting data out that separates sub ad to content and also what does the granularity look like, how does that affect the metrics, that will really help the market understand. So when we start putting all the pieces together at the end of sort of 2022 so that the market can start to see it, everyone's sort of familiar with what to expect. So there's a ramp here, but there's again, monetizable components, built with a consistency and a vision towards this comparable cross-media set of metrics ultimately. So that's the plan, Todd."

And your question is kind of a U.S. question. I would say in certain parts of the world like India, it's -- we're already largely mobile. So I think we're absolutely finding ways to do measurement.

We are uniquely positioned as the essential data, measurement and analytics provider for the entire media ecosystem, with a strong foundation for the future. We are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets, and we are doing this globally. We are undergoing a cultural shift, with a growth-driven mindset. And we have a compelling financial model, with an improving financial profile. 
I am really excited about our clarity, focus and alignment as we move forward with executing on our growth strategy. Linda will review the financials in detail. And I'll provide a high-level look, before I review the business highlights. 
We are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 2.3% organic. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded over 600 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $0.47 increased from $0.36 in the prior year. And free cash flow was $115 million, up from the first quarter of 2020. 
Our teams are executing well. Across the organization, our employees have rallied. It is so rewarding to see all of our hard work and perseverance over the last couple of years begin to pay off. 
From a macro perspective, we are starting to see some economies and spending gradually open up as pandemic restrictions ease, although this varies greatly by market, and the pandemic is still prevalent. Our colleagues in hard hit areas, such as India and Brazil, are top of mind right now. We continue to prioritize the safety and wellness of both colleagues, as we do with all of our colleagues. I want to once again thank our employees for the resilience and dedication they've shown since the start of the global pandemic. This is the team I'm. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2021 growth plan, and we are raising key [Audio Gap] 3 essential solutions: audience measurement, audience outcome and Content Services. Across the Board, our product-led strategy has been an important driver of our growth. We are adding new clients and markets, while also bringing more services and value to existing clients. 
Starting with Audience Measurement. Nielsen One is at the forefront of our strategic priorities. We are committed to providing a single cross-media currency to the media industry in the United States and our markets around the world. Since our launch announcement in December 2020, we've made good progress on the product, our client commitments and with industry engagement. We have great engagement with advertisers, agencies, platforms and networks in the Nielsen One committees around both technical implementation and business and currency changes. The currency evolution is important to both media buyers and sellers. We're working with advertising associations, such as the ANA or Association of National Advertisers, and WFA, the World Federation of Advertisers, on their long-term cross-media initiatives. We are also working across the ecosystem with broadcasters and leading digital players to meet advertiser requirements. And we're focused on ensuring that clients see the value of our innovative solutions, both today and in the future. 
Let me now share some specific Audience Measurement milestones hit during Q1, starting with client renewals. We are encouraged by renewals in Q1 across both broadcast and digital pure plays, with multiyear commitments and price escalators. Our commitment to full coverage, resilient and comparable cross-media measurement will serve the industry well as it evolves. We launched our identity resolution system in January. As we announced in March, our strategic alliance with Roku substantially expands our footprint of smart TVs and other devices, now nearing 100 million in total. As part of the alliance, our ad and content measurement products will also be integrated into the Roku platform. 
Last month, we announced the launch of Nielsen streaming video ratings, which provides unique visibility into total viewership and advanced audience demographic insights at the platform level alongside linear TV ratings. Demand has been strong, with 7 out of our top 10 clients already signed up. Combined with Nielsen SVOD content ratings, which provide ratings at the program level, we now deliver comprehensive streaming performance metrics across program, platform and streaming category. 
We are working across our clients to embed Nielsen more easily into their buying and selling workflows. A big first step was relaunching NPower, our measurement portal, as an easier-to-use cloud-based interface. We've also made good progress with always-on digital measurement, which is a significant step towards true comparable cross-media measurement across digital, linear and addressable TV. Our recent alliance with Roku will include always-on measurement. 
There has been some recent press about how the COVID pandemic impacted viewing habits and the resulting ratings. Let me help frame this for you. Without a doubt, the pandemic-affected audience behavior. New content production slowed. Sports were sidelined for a while, and then had abbreviated and overlapping schedules. streaming platforms accelerated massively beyond the pre-COVID trends. We were able to perform most of our field work remotely throughout the pandemic, but CDC and state guidelines prevented us from entering panelist homes, either to sign up new panelists or maintain existing homes. 
As with any change or disruptive event, such as extreme weather in the past, we recorded our changes with the Media Rating Council, or MRC, and committed to assessing the full impact of the changes as soon as possible. However, the pandemic has lasted longer than anyone anticipated. We only were able to recently restore full in-home maintenance for the vast majority of communities in recent weeks. We have continued to work with the MRC to make sure we had validated data to fully assess any impact. 
Our panel remains robust and representative, and the integrity of our ratings estimates remains high. I also want to be clear that our panels are foundational to audience measurement. Panels, combined with big data, enable us to provide the media industry with a comprehensive and representative view of consumer media behavior at the person's level, with panels as the key truth set. As a part of our broader Nielsen One strategy, we're continuing to invest in and grow our panel and continue to incorporate big data to make our measurement deeper and richer. 
Let me turn to Audience Outcomes, where we serve as one of the largest outcomes measurement providers in the media ecosystem globally. We have a broad array of solutions within Outcomes and continue to make progress on integrating our portfolio. This simplification will help to improve our go-to-market approach to clients across publishers, platform, advertisers and agencies. We continue to grow our business with advertisers across new verticals in the U.S. and globally. Recent wins include Dell, WWE, J&J, Florida Blue and Hasbro. 
In April, we launched Nielsen Market Lift, a campaign outcomes measurement tool built on scalable, cloud-native platform. The global launch covers 37 markets, enabling clients around the globe to quickly evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing campaigns. 
And we're growing with leading digital players, including Spotify, as we mentioned last quarter. In April, we expanded our relationship with Twitter, a long-standing audience measurement client, to help their video advertisers do more robust pre and post campaign planning, maximize ad effectiveness and deliver campaign results with increased speed and agility. 
Finally, Gracenote Content Services. Gracenote is the global leader in entertainment metadata. And we are making good progress on our strategy, as publishers and MVPDs around the world recognize the increased value of our content solutions. We are developing new solutions to address market needs on a global basis, particularly as content instrument platforms continue to grow, creating more competition for audiences. For example, we recently launched a new service, Personalized Imagery, which allows linear and streaming TV providers to dynamically display program images that resonate with individual viewers based on their preferences and previous consumption. It's a valuable tool that drives engagement and enables clients to maximize viewership on their platforms. I look forward to sharing additional new Gracenote products later this year. 
Before I sum up, I want to note that, in March, we appointed Sandra Sims Williams as Chief Diversity Officer. You may recall that this is a role I previously held as we work to make the new Nielsen a truly diverse business. Diversity, equity and inclusion are crucial to the success of our business, and it remains a top personal priority for me, for the leadership team and for the Nielsen Board. Sandra has been a great partner since joining Nielsen in January 2020, and I am confident that her leadership, wisdom and experience will only accelerate our progress. 
To close. With the Connect sale behind us, this marks our first quarter as the new Nielsen, singularly focused on the media ecosystem. We have made significant progress modernizing our technology and data science, which drives scale and efficiency throughout the organization. We are driving growth from new solutions across all of our end markets, and we are benefiting from the cultural transformation driven by a growth mindset. We have a compelling financial model and are focused on driving improvement across key metrics. 
Our solid first quarter reflects the strong execution by our teams globally, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We have confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2021 plan and our medium-term targets. 
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to review the financials."

Before I discuss our Q1 results, I want to spend a moment on the Connect sale and resulting debt paydown. We closed on the sale of Connect on March 5. We used $2.3 billion of the $2.4 billion of net sales proceeds to pay off our 2021 and 2022 bonds as well as $1.3 billion of term loan debt due in 2023 and 2025. The transaction also strengthened our balance sheet by lowering pension and other liability by approximately $200 million, although these liabilities, the sale proceeds and the related gain on sale are preliminary and subject to change as we finalize the transaction accounting later in the year. As a result of the sale, effective this quarter, Connect is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. 
My remarks today will focus on the new Nielsen, which represents our results pro forma for the Connect sale and as of the $2.3 billion debt paydown took place at the beginning of 2020. This approach helps with prior year comparisons and it's consistent with how we handle Investor Day in December and our 2021 guidance. 
Turning to the first quarter. As David highlighted, we are pleased with our Q1 results, which reflects solid performance and a nice start to the year. 
I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our first quarter revenue performance. 
Revenue for Q1 was $863 million, up 1.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or up 2.3% organic, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan. On a reported basis, revenue grew 2.5%, which includes an FX benefit of 120 basis points. We saw strength in both the U.S. and international markets. 
We were pleased to see quarterly growth trends continue to improve following the COVID dislocation. The effects of COVID continue to lessen though we did still see some ongoing impact in the first quarter. 
Audience Measurement revenue grew 1.9% constant currency and 2.3% on an organic basis. Growth was solid across the board and especially strong in digital measurement. We're also pleased to see pressures in local subsiding. 
Outcomes and Content revenue declined 0.4% constant currency, with organic revenue up 2.2%. The uneven return of live sports due to COVID continued to play out in Q1, but we did see some improving trends in short-cycle revenue as well as solid growth in Content. 
The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rate. As you can see, the growth trend improved nicely in Q1 following the impact of COVID over the last few quarters. 
Turning now to Slide 8. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million, up 19% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 18.3% on a constant currency basis. Revenue was up $21 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. And costs were down $41 million year-over-year, resulting in margin expansion of 646 basis points on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%. 
On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters on a new Nielsen basis. 
As a reminder, we took swift actions in late Q1 last year and cut temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs return more meaningfully in the second quarter and will continue to ramp as this year progresses. We also began to implement a restructuring or optimization plan in the third quarter last year. So the incremental year-over-year benefit is more pronounced in the first half of this year versus the second half. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 as compared to $0.36 in Q1 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and slightly lower depreciation and amortization, offset in part by higher taxes. 
Our effective tax rate was 35.5% in the first quarter, which included a $16 million discrete item, as we revalued our net deferred tax liability to reflect the new Nielsen tax profile in the absence of Connect. This discrete item is added back to adjusted net income, resulting in a normalized first quarter tax rate of approximately 26%. We continue to expect an estimated tax rate of 26% to 28% for the full year, excluding discrete items. 
Free cash flow was $115 million, which compares to $22 million in Q1 2020. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA, onetime costs in the prior year and lower CapEx, which was largely timing driven. We continue to expect CapEx to be relatively flat for the year. 
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10. 
With Connect discontinued operations treatment finalized, we have rounded out the pro forma amount here on Slide 10 to include 2020 adjusted EPS and updated free cash flow. And in the appendix on Slide 20, we recast our 2020 P&L by quarter on a continuing operations basis so you can see the impacts of Connect as a discontinued operation. 
And then on Slide 21, we are providing quarterly new Nielsen adjusted EPS for 2020. 
Today, we are raising elements of our 2021 guidance following the strong first quarter results. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $10 million, which results in a range of $1.470 billion to $1.490 billion, with margins in the 42.25% to 42.5% range, which compares to 2020 pro forma stand-alone margins of 42%. As we discussed last quarter, our 2021 EBITDA forecast reflects the approximately $60 million benefit of the optimization plan this year and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return this year of approximately $100 million of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year as well as incremental growth investment. 
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.58, up $0.04 from our prior guidance range. This compares to $1.45 in 2020, pro forma for the new Nielsen. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $10 million, plus another $10 million of lower debt costs, mostly due to the higher debt paydown than initially contemplated. 
We are raising our free cash flow guidance by $15 million to a range of $595 million to $645 million. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen bears under the Connect sale agreement. These cash costs are forecast to be $220 million to $240 million this year, with approximately $134 million incurred in Q1. The vast majority of these costs are included in discontinued operation. This is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs. 
For revenue, we continue to forecast 3.5% to 4.5% organic growth, with significant improvements in both Audience Measurement and Outcomes and Content. And we forecast constant currency growth of 2% to 3%. Organic revenue growth adjusts for the impact of business and market exits. 
And now I'll provide some commentary on how we see the balance of the year playing out. 
We continue to expect revenue growth to be faster in the second half of the year than in the first half. Recall that we began to see more significant impacts of COVID beginning in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we expect the benefit of our growth initiatives to ramp as the year progresses. 
We continue to expect year-over-year margin expansion in the first half of the year, driven by the strong margin expansion in Q1. As I noted earlier, temporary costs are returning this year, which impacts margins beginning in the second quarter. And we began to implement the optimization plan in the third quarter of last year. As a result, The second half faces a more challenging comparison, and we continue to expect year-over-year margin contraction in the second half of the year. 
Beyond these results and our outlook, we were pleased that following the Connect sale, Moody's revised its outlook on Nielsen from negative to positive and S&P took us off credit watch negative. We ended Q1 with 3.77x net debt leverage on a new Nielsen basis. This is the first time our net debt leverage has been below 4x since 2017. And we're progressing well to hit our 3x to 3.5x net debt leverage target. 
To wrap up, we are pleased with our first quarter results and remain confident in our ability to execute on the new Nielsen growth story and deliver results in line with the full year guidance we updated today. 
And now I'll turn it back to Sara for the Q&A session."

It's been, I think, a real progress on the team to see the power of that data platform and the data science that makes it all comparable. 
The other thing that I feel really good about is the amount of industry engagement. As I mentioned, for some time, the ANA and WSA have had cross-media measurement task forces. And we're engaging with them and making sure their requirements. And in addition, agencies, advertisers, networks and platforms have all committed people to join us on regular committee meetings. There are 6 subcommittees to make sure the industry is ready for this. So I feel like we're delivering, but more importantly, I think the industry is engaged and wants to move in this direction."

You've got a -- I think, look back, but you've also got a look forward because so many things were launched and innovated, even in the last 90 days. And so I think the whole industry is trying to figure that out, and we are actively engaged. 
What I would say is that the role of Nielsen is broader. So on the new front side, of course, Roku mentioned their partnership with us and their ability to provide third-party measurement. Nielsen is very strong in the Google presentation yesterday. And so I would say, what is encouraging to me is that the advertisers are getting what they want, which is comparable and full coverage metrics. And we're in more places than we've ever been before to help solve that. 
So it's going to be an interesting upfront as everybody kind of has to agree and commit to their best guess for '21. We're certainly helping to do that, and then we're very committed to making sure we measure that thoroughly as we go through the year. And it's, again, much more broad than it's been in the past.

We had some really important renewals, as I mentioned in my remarks. And as always, we have multiyear contracts with clients. They do involve pricing and price escalators over the course of those multiyear contracts. And so in those, the road to Nielsen One was clear. And it enabled those who are signing up with us for the next phase to have a road map that they believe in and could align their business models with. So it's not like there's suddenly a new product. Nielsen One is the migration of a number of Audience Measurement products into a new product. And everybody who's subscribing to those is making longer-term commitments are agreeing to pricing. And I think we're adjusting pricing in some places to get it all comparable as well across digital and linear measurement. And so I think we'll just continue to see benefit, and it will compound the way a subscription business does. 
In terms of milestones, I want to be committed to, it's the road map we laid out at Investor Day. I think we're very keen to get to addressable in the metric and to be able to serve the addressable market. So that's next. Connected TV is coming on strong. Roku, of course, helps with that, but there are others as well that are being integrated. And I think we are also really focused on the buy side, as I said, to make sure we're embedded in workflows. We're making real progress on being easier to use. And that's important because I think the other part of Nielsen one, with all the data we're going to provide, it's going to allow many more decisions to be made at the front line. And so getting all the media buyers, and planners, and advertisers, and in agencies to find it easier to work with them and to connect to all the tools they're using is also helping. So that's where we are. And again, I think the industry engagement and making sure we have industry associations aligned, we're working closely with MRC, making sure accreditation can work, all of that's right on progress. And I think we'll continue to report progress virtually every quarter for the next couple of years on this roadmap."

And every day, we find new ways that people are engaging in media, and we're going to continue to move at that pace. I'm excited about the replatforming of the company because it allows us to go faster to make sure that coverage works. 
Comparability, to make sure we're measuring it all the same way. I think we've got a good method to do that. We've got the data to do that, and we're proving it out. And I'm really happy with the rollout of the Nielsen ID to help tie those things together. Resiliency is always enhanced with more data. To be very clear, we've had -- this is a big increase in data as we've been combining big data and panel together. So I feel, certainly, our estimates are far away the best in the market and will continue to be so. 
I will always be seeking additional partners to make sure that we can make that as robust as possible. I don't think there's anything we have to have beyond what we have, but I think there are -- that doesn't mean we're not going to keep working to improve our resiliency as Nielsen One rolls out. And the industry is going to continue to fragment. And so as you get to more fragmentation, you do want to make sure you've got as much data as possible so that you can be really as precise as you can, not only on big properties, but also on niche properties as well."

If we just step back a little bit and we think about all of the elements of our guidance, we definitely spend a lot of time thinking through that because of the strength of the quarter. 
And what I would say is, first and foremost, we're confident about the revenue guide, which we did not change. The strength of the quarter though did give us confidence to raise the EBITDA range by the $10 million, as you noted. And there are a lot of moving parts. And with COVID last year, it makes for a really complicated analysis, a little bit of noise with the Connect divestiture as well. But we analyze all of that. And we thought that given that EBITDA was a little bit ahead of our expectations, but yet, there are some things that we have to be mindful of in the balance of the year. 
So if we think about this, Q2 last year was the quarter that we saw the impacts of COVID from a revenue perspective. I would also point out that we will see the return of the temporary costs, and those will start to ramp up more significantly in this current quarter because at this time last year that we were really starting to take those costs out. 
Then also, Toni, in the balance of the year, going to see our investments in growth initiatives which are going to ramp. And so when you think about all of that, in addition to the optimization plan, which we implemented in the second half of last year, obviously, the optimization plan served us very well in the first quarter with the margin expansion that you noted. But we will start to lap the impacts, the benefits of the optimization plan as we get into the second half of the year. So it makes for quite a bit of unevenness as we think about the revenue in relation to expense throughout the balance of the year. 
But stepping back from it all, it's in line with what we expected and all reflected in our guidance. So it's really just, as we reflected on the strength of the quarter, and our consideration of the balance of the year and what we had anticipated, it's what really made sense. 
We are definitely in a growth mode right now. But as I pointed out, with the incremental investments that are going to be a little bit lower margin as the revenue will lag the investment. And so that will be some noise that plays out in the balance of the year, all considered in our guidance. 
So I think if you step back and reflect all in all of that, it's a complicated analysis, but one that we continue to be comfortable with, given permanent costs dynamic, temporary costs dynamic, COVID revenue impacts. So that was really the thought process that we went through as we analyzed how to handle guidance for the quarter."

So for whoever wants to take it. I was hoping you could help me. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around what the shape of the type of commercial relationships you think will evolve with your digital-first sort of pure-play digital customers over time. 
And what I mean is, for your traditional historical TV-centric business partners, customers, we have decades of history with that. We sort of know what that looks like. You have multiyear, as you've said, sort of master service agreements, contents, with a lot of certainty around a sort of guaranteed price with escalators, and we know what that looks like. 
On the digital side, is that the model that you think will evolve, that you're trying to work towards? There's so much growth there? Do you -- would you rather have something that's more variable in nature to sort of flex that commercial relationship with the growth in their impressions and revenue? Is there some sort of hybrid? You mentioned even in the quarter, renewals with digital customers. I'm just wondering how you're evolving those commercial relationships as that -- those relations just mature."

I will take that question because I spend a lot of time on -- with our clients on that topic. 
Listen, I -- the whole movement to Nielsen One is telling the industry that we believe the audience is the audience, whether she's engaged on a streaming platform or a broadcast platform. And that everybody is going to be more of a hybrid. So that means there really should be one model. And the model is closer to the historical model we've had with the linear players, which are now all digital players also. And so I think we've certainly been working with the digital players on multiyear relationships, and we have been successful there in some really important places. And on pricing, that is comparable to -- for the value. So they're going to compete with everybody else at that pricing, then the pricing from Nielsen needs to be the same as well. And so it's a multiyear escalators tied to value. 
Of course, with every client, we also look at their volume and scale. So we do certainly make some arguments about future growth with our digital players. But I would say we're going to be better off to serve the industry on a level playing field, with very similar terms, standard contracts, standard pricing as a subscription business. And I think we -- I hear you about, do you leave some of the expert upside? Perhaps. But I think that the flip side is what the industry needs. And particularly, keep in mind, we have -- we serve the buyers as much as the sellers here, having comparability, having full coverage, meaning it's all the same, and having resiliency really does put it all on the same platform with the same terms."

I'm actually going to let Karthik also step in here because we spend a lot of time on our design of the Connected TV measurement. And honestly, this is why we are so robust to have this combination of big data we get from a lot of platforms, including Connected TV platform, and the importance of validating that with a very robust panel sample, because I think there have been just challenges for anyone who just tried to use big data to ever do audience measurement, and it is important to do both. 
On the other hand, there's also some specific things that others are doing. And some new companies were formed here totally around visibility or viewability. And part of what we're doing is also making this more interoperable as opposed to sort of having to launch yet another viewability standard. So we do think it's important. We do think we can work with others. I don't think we have to be in all these spaces directly. I think we're the fundamental platform for audience measurement. And we will connect with others to help make that work.

So I'll just highlight one of the things you mentioned because it's really important to understand how we integrate directly with the CTV player. I think that's where it all begins. Eventually, when the measurement of CTV goes into the entire ecosystem, so that measurement is available across all steps of the value chain, we will obviously pay a lot more. Just like in digital, we'll pay a lot more consistent attention to things like viewability and fraud. Those are important complementary metrics, just like in good old digital. 
But I think our starting point is direct integrations with the CTV players, not about being connected into the intermediaries. So this way, our starting point as this measurement evolves is starting at the purest form. That's the way it's actually delivered. So this is important. But as the industry expands, as there's more ecosystem players, there's a great growth opportunity at large, that's going to be an area where then fraud, viewability, all these capabilities are going to be important bolt-ons."

And you'll see where that even what we put out today is more singularly focused on the new Nielsen and on media, and we'll look to improve from there. But I think the best analogy, Richard, would be to go back to some of what Karthik talked about at Investor Day. And he shared directionally somewhat how we're thinking about growth versus sustained as we look at our CapEx investments. Now obviously, there's a lot in the thought process from an R&D perspective. But even as we went through our strategic planning process last year, we really focused on what the return is going to be on investment. So we're continuing to introduce more rigor and refine that process. 
But if I just go back to some of the trends that Karthik shared at Investor Day. For 2020, we are kind of looking directionally at a 75-25 relationship of growth versus, let's say, sustained investments as we think about our CapEx. And in 2021, we're dialing that up significantly. We'll be looking at more of a 40-60 relationship as we think about growth versus sustained. And then as we discussed at Investor Day, we're looking to have that relationship be more of a 50-50 relationship by 2023. 
What's interesting to see playing out here is the convergence between linear and digital. And that influences the way in which we are investing. And we made very clear at Investor Day that our current priority is investing in single platform, investing in Nielsen One. And so suffice it to say, the lion's share of our current investments are being directed there. And we are significantly dialing up that investment in order to be where our customers and clients are in order to support the continued convergence. But that will give you a feel directionally. As far as breaking it out in the future, we'll continue to assess, but don't expect anything in the next 90 days or 6 months."

We delivered a solid first quarter, building off the strong momentum and execution you saw from us in 2020. We have the right leadership team in place, a deep bench and we are building a track record of success.
In March, we closed on the sale of Global Connect, and we've now officially embarked on the next new chapter as a New Nielsen. We are uniquely positioned as the essential data, measurement and analytics provider for the entire media ecosystem, with a strong foundation for the future. We are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets, and we are doing this globally. We are undergoing a cultural shift with a growth-driven mindset, and we have a compelling financial model with an improving financial profile.  
I am really excited about our clarity, focus and alignment as we move forward with executing on our growth strategy. Linda will review the financials in detail, and I'll provide a high-level look before I review the business highlights.  
We are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 2.3% organic. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded over 600 basis points, our adjusted EPS of $0.47 increased from $0.36 in the prior year and free cash flow was $115 million, up from the first quarter of 2020.  
Our teams are executing well. Across the organization, our employees have rallied. It is so rewarding to see all of our hard work and perseverance over the last couple of years begin to pay off. 
From a macro perspective, we are starting to see some economies and spending gradually open up as pandemic restrictions ease, although this varies greatly by market and the pandemic is still prevalent. Our colleagues in hard-hit areas, such as India and Brazil, are top of mind right now. We continue to prioritize the safety and wellness of both colleagues, as we do with all of our colleagues. I want to once again thank our employees for the resilience and dedication they've shown since the start of the global pandemic. This is the team I'm proud to lead and proud to be a part of.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2021 growth plan, and we are raising key elements of our 2021 guidance. Now let me walk you through the progress we are making in driving growth across our  3 essential solutions: Audience Measurement, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services. Across the board, our product-led strategy has been an important driver of our growth. We are adding new clients and markets while also bringing more services and value to existing clients.  
Starting with Audience Measurement. Nielsen ONE is at the forefront of our strategic priorities. We are committed to providing a single cross-media currency to the media industry in the United States and our markets around the world. Since our launch announcement in December 2020, we've made good progress on the product, our client commitments and with industry engagement. We have great engagement with advertisers, agencies, platforms and networks in the Nielsen ONE committees around both technical implementation and business and currency changes. The currency evolution is important to both media buyers and sellers. We're working with advertising associations, such as the ANA or Association of National Advertisers and WFA, the World Federation of Advertisers, on their long-term cross-media initiatives. We are also working across the ecosystem with broadcasters and leading digital players to meet advertiser requirements. And we're focused on ensuring that clients see the value of our innovative solutions, both today and in the future.  
Let me now share some specific Audience Measurement milestones hit during Q1, starting with client renewals. We are encouraged by renewals in Q1 across both broadcast and digital pure plays, with multiyear commitments and price escalators. Our commitment to full coverage, resilient and comparable cross-media measurement will serve the industry well as it evolves. We launched our identity resolution system in January. As we announced in March, our strategic alliance with Roku substantially expands our footprint of smart TVs and other devices, now nearing 100 million in total. As part of the alliance, our ad and content measurement products will also be integrated into the Roku platform. 
Last month, we announced the launch of Nielsen Streaming Video Ratings, which provides unique visibility into total viewership and advanced audience demographic insights at the platform level alongside linear TV ratings. Demand has been strong, with 7 out of our top 10 clients already signed up. Combined with Nielsen SVOD Content Ratings, which provide ratings at the program level, we now deliver comprehensive streaming performance metrics across program, platform and streaming category. 
We are working across our clients to embed Nielsen more easily into their buying and selling workflows. A big first step was relaunching NPOWER, our measurement portal, as an easier-to-use cloud-based interface. We've also made good progress with always-on digital measurement, which is a significant step towards true comparable cross-media measurement across digital, linear and addressable TV. Our recent alliance with Roku will include always-on measurement.  
There has been some recent press about how the COVID pandemic impacted viewing habits and the resulting ratings. Let me help frame this for you. Without a doubt, the pandemic affected audience behavior. New content production slowed, sports were sidelined for a while and then had abbreviated and overlapping schedules, streaming platforms accelerated massively beyond the pre-COVID trends. We were able to perform most of our field work remotely throughout the pandemic, but CDC and state guidelines prevented us from entering panelist homes, either to sign up new panelists or maintain existing homes. As with any change or disruptive event, such as extreme weather in the past, we recorded our changes with the Media Rating Council, or MRC, and committed to assessing the full impact of the changes as soon as possible. However, the pandemic has lasted longer than anyone anticipated. We only were able to recently restore full in-home maintenance for the vast majority of communities in recent weeks. We have continued to work with the MRC to make sure we had validated data to fully assess any impact. 
Our panel remains robust and representative, and the integrity of our ratings estimates remains high. I also want to be clear that our panels are foundational to audience measurement. Panels, combined with big data, enable us to provide the media industry with a comprehensive and representative view of consumer media behavior at the person's level, with panels as the key truth set. As a part of our broader Nielsen ONE strategy, we're continuing to invest in and grow our panel and continue to incorporate big data to make our measurement deeper and richer.  
Let me turn to Audience Outcomes, where we serve as one of the largest outcomes measurement providers in the media ecosystem globally. We have a broad array of solutions within outcomes and continue to make progress on integrating our portfolio. This simplification will help to improve our go-to-market approach to clients across publishers, platform, advertisers and agencies. We continue to grow our business with advertisers across new verticals in the U.S. and globally. Recent wins include Dell, WWE, J&J, Florida Blue and Hasbro. 
In April, we launched Nielsen Market Lift, a campaign outcomes measurement tool built on scalable cloud-native platform. The global launch covers 37 markets, enabling clients around the globe to quickly evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing campaigns.  
And we're growing with leading digital players, including Spotify, as we mentioned last quarter. In April, we expanded our relationship with Twitter, a long-standing audience measurement client to help their video advertisers do more robust pre- and post-campaign planning, maximize ad effectiveness and deliver campaign results with increased speed and agility.  
Finally, Gracenote Content Services. Gracenote is the global leader in entertainment metadata. And we are making good progress on our strategy, as publishers and MVPDs around the world recognize the increased value of our content solutions. We are developing new solutions to address market needs on a global basis, particularly as content instrument platforms continue to grow, creating more competition for audiences. For example, we recently launched a new service, Personalized Imagery, which allows linear and streaming TV providers to dynamically display program images that resonate with individual viewers based on their preferences and previous consumption. It's a valuable tool that drives engagement and enables clients to maximize viewership on their platforms. I look forward to sharing additional new Gracenote products later this year.  
Before I sum up, I want to note that in March, we appointed Sandra Sims-Williams as Chief Diversity Officer. You may recall that this is a role I previously held as we work to make the New Nielsen a truly diverse business. Diversity, equity and inclusion are crucial to the success of our business, and it remains a top personal priority for me, for the leadership team and for the Nielsen Board. Sandra has been a great partner since joining Nielsen in January 2020, and I am confident that her leadership, wisdom and experience will only accelerate our progress.  
To close, with the Connect sale behind us, this marks our first quarter as the New Nielsen, singularly focused on the media ecosystem. We have made significant progress modernizing our technology and data science, which drives scale and efficiency throughout the organization. We are driving growth from new solutions across all of our end markets, and we are benefiting from the cultural transformation driven by a growth mindset. We have a compelling financial model and are focused on driving improvement across key metrics.  Our solid first quarter reflects the strong execution by our teams globally, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead.

Before I discuss our Q1 results, I want to spend a moment on the Connect sale and resulting debt paydown. We closed on the sale of Connect on March 5. We used $2.3 billion of the $2.4 billion of net sales proceeds to pay off our 2021 and 2022 bonds as well as $1.3 billion of term loan debt due in 2023 and 2025. The transaction also strengthened our balance sheet by lowering pension and other liability by approximately $200 million. Although these liabilities, the sale proceeds and the related gain on sale are preliminary and subject to change as we finalize the transaction accounting later in the year. As a result of the sale, effective this quarter, Connect is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  
My remarks today will focus on the New Nielsen, which represents our results pro forma for the Connect sale and as if the $2.3 billion debt paydown took place at the beginning of 2020. This approach helps with prior year comparisons and it's consistent with how we handle Investor Day in December and our 2021 guidance.  
Turning to the first quarter. As David highlighted, we are pleased with our Q1 results, which reflects solid performance and a nice start to the year. 
I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our first quarter revenue performance.  Revenue for Q1 was $863 million, up 1.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or up 2.3% organic, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan. On a reported basis, revenue grew 2.5%, which includes an FX benefit of 120 basis points. We saw strength in both the U.S. and international markets. We were pleased to see quarterly growth trends continue to improve following the COVID dislocation. The effects of COVID continue to lessen though we did still see some ongoing impact in the first quarter.  
Audience Measurement revenue grew 1.9% constant currency and 2.3% on an organic basis. Growth was solid across the board and especially strong in digital measurement. We're also pleased to see pressures in local subsiding.  
Outcomes and Content revenue declined 0.4% constant currency, with organic revenue up 2.2%. The uneven return of live sports due to COVID continued to play out in Q1, but we did see some improving trends in short-cycle revenue as well as solid growth in Content.  The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rate. As you can see, the growth trend improved nicely in Q1 following the impact of COVID over the last few quarters.  
Turning now to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million, up 19% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 18.3% on a constant currency basis. Revenue was up $21 million compared to the first quarter of 2020 and costs were down $41 million year-over-year, resulting in margin expansion of 646 basis points on a constant currency basis and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%.  On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters on a New Nielsen basis. 
As a reminder, we took swift actions in late Q1 last year and cut temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs return more meaningfully in the second quarter and will continue to ramp as this year progresses. We also began to implement a restructuring or optimization plan in the third quarter last year, so the incremental year-over-year benefit is more pronounced in the first half of this year versus the second half.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 as compared to $0.36 in Q1 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and slightly lower depreciation and amortization, offset in part by higher taxes. Our effective tax rate was 35.5% in the first quarter, which included a $16 million discrete item, as we revalued our net deferred tax liability to reflect the New Nielsen tax profile in the absence of Connect. This discrete item is added back to adjusted net income, resulting in a normalized first quarter tax rate of approximately 26%. We continue to expect an estimated tax rate of 26% to 28% for the full year, excluding discrete items.  
Free cash flow was $115 million, which compares to $22 million in Q1 2020. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA, onetime costs in the prior year and lower CapEx, which was largely timing driven. We continue to expect CapEx to be relatively flat for the year.  
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10.  With Connect discontinued operations treatment finalized, we have rounded out the pro forma amount here on Slide 10 to include 2020 adjusted EPS and updated free cash flow. And in the appendix on Slide 20, we recast our 2020 P&L by quarter on a continuing operations basis so you can see the impacts of Connect as a discontinued operation.  And then on Slide 21, we are providing quarterly New Nielsen adjusted EPS for 2020.  
Today, we are raising elements of our 2021 guidance following the strong first quarter results. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $10 million, which results in a range of $1.470 billion to $1.490 billion, with margins in the 42.25% to 42.5% range, which compares to 2020 pro forma stand-alone margins of 42%. As we discussed last quarter, our 2021 EBITDA forecast reflects the approximately $60 million benefit of the optimization plan this year and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return this year of approximately $100 million of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year as well as incremental growth investment.  
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.58, up $0.04 from our prior guidance range. This compares to $1.45 in 2020, pro forma for the New Nielsen. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $10 million, plus another $10 million of lower debt costs, mostly due to the higher debt paydown than initially contemplated. 
We are raising our free cash flow guidance by $15 million to a range of $595 million to $645 million. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen bears under the Connect sale agreement. These cash costs are forecast to be $220 million to $240 million this year, with approximately $134 million incurred in Q1. The vast majority of these costs are included in discontinued operations. This is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs.  
For revenue, we continue to forecast 3.5% to 4.5% organic growth, with significant improvements in both Audience Measurement and Outcomes and Content. And we forecast constant currency growth of 2% to 3%. Organic revenue growth adjusts for the impact of business and market exits.  
And now I'll provide some commentary on how we see the balance of the year playing out. We continue to expect revenue growth to be faster in the second half of the year than in the first half. Recall that we began to see more significant impacts of COVID beginning in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we expect the benefit of our growth initiatives to ramp as the year progresses. We continue to expect year-over-year margin expansion in the first half of the year, driven by the strong margin expansion in Q1.  
As I noted earlier, temporary costs are returning this year, which impacts margins beginning in the second quarter. And we began to implement the optimization plan in the third quarter of last year. As a result, the second half faces a more challenging comparison, and we continue to expect year-over-year margin contraction in the second half of the year.  
Beyond these results and our outlook, we were pleased that following the Connect sale, Moody's revised its outlook on Nielsen from negative to positive and S&P took us off CreditWatch negative. We ended Q1 with 3.77x net debt leverage on a New Nielsen basis. This is the first time our net debt leverage has been below 4x since 2017. And we're progressing well to hit our 3x to 3.5x net debt leverage target.  
To wrap up, we are pleased with our first quarter results and remain confident in our ability to execute on the New Nielsen growth story and deliver results in line with the full year guidance we updated today.  
And now I'll turn it back to Sara for the Q&A session."

The other thing that I feel really good about is the amount of industry engagement. As I mentioned, for some time, the ANA and WFA have had cross-media measurement task forces. And we're engaging with them and making sure we meet their requirements. And in addition, agencies, advertisers, networks and platforms have all committed people to join us on regular committee meetings. There are 6 subcommittees to make sure the industry is ready for this. So I feel like we're delivering, but more importantly, I think the industry is engaged and wants to move in this direction."

You've got to, I think, look back, but you've also got to look forward because so many things were launched and innovated, even in the last 90 days. And so I think the whole industry is trying to figure that out, and we are actively engaged.  
What I would say is that the role of Nielsen is broader. So on the new front side, of course, Roku mentioned their partnership with us and their ability to provide third-party measurement. Nielsen was very strong in the Google presentation yesterday. And so I would say, what is encouraging to me is that the advertisers are getting what they want, which is comparable and full coverage metrics. And we're in more places than we've ever been before to help solve that. 
So it's going to be an interesting upfront as everybody kind of has to agree and commit to their best guess for '21. We're certainly helping to do that, and then we're very committed to making sure we measure that thoroughly as we go through the year. And it's, again, much more broad than it's been in the past. I think that's reflective of how the industry is coming together as one industry."

We had some really important renewals, as I mentioned in my remarks. And as always, we have multiyear contracts with clients. They do involve pricing and price escalators over the course of those multiyear contracts. And so in those, the road to Nielsen ONE was clear. And it enabled those who were signing up with us for the next phase to have a road map that they believe in and could align their business models with. 
So it's not like there's suddenly a new product. Nielsen ONE is the migration of a number of Audience Measurement products into a new product. And everybody who's subscribing to those is making longer-term commitments, are agreeing to pricing. And I think we're adjusting pricing in some places to get it all comparable as well across digital and linear measurement. And so I think we'll just continue to see benefit, and it will compound the way a subscription business does.  
In terms of milestones and the ones we've committed to, it's the road map we laid out at Investor Day. I think we're very keen to get to addressable in the metric and to be able to serve the addressable market, so that's next. Connected TV is coming on strong. Roku, of course, helped with that, but there are others as well that are being integrated. And I think we are also really focused on the buy-side, as I said, to make sure we're embedded in workflows. We're making real progress on being easier to use. And that's important because I think the other part of Nielsen ONE, with all the data we're going to provide, it's going to allow many more decisions to be made at the front line. And so getting all the media buyers and planners, in advertisers and in agencies to find it easier to work with them and to connect to all the tools they're using is also helping. So that's where we are. 
And again, I think the industry engagement and making sure we have industry associations aligned, we're working closely with MRC, making sure accreditation can work. All of that's right on progress. And I think we'll continue to report progress virtually every quarter for the next couple of years on this road map."

And every day, we find new ways that people are engaging in media, and we're going to continue to move at that pace. I'm excited about the replatforming of the company because it allows us to go faster to make sure that coverage works. 
Comparability, to make sure we're measuring it all the same way. I think we've got a good method to do that, we've got the data to do that and we're proving it out. And I'm really happy with the rollout of the Nielsen ID to help tie those things together. Resiliency is always enhanced with more data. To be very clear, we've had -- this is a big increase in data as we've been combining big data and panel together. So I feel, certainly, our estimates are far away the best in the market and will continue to be so. 
I will always be seeking additional partners to make sure that we can make that as robust as possible. I don't think there's anything we have to have beyond what we have, but I think there are -- that doesn't mean we're not going to keep working to improve our resiliency as Nielsen ONE rolls out. And the industry is going to continue to fragment. And so as you get to more fragmentation, you do want to make sure you've got as much data as possible so that you can be really as precise as you can, not only on big properties, but also on niche properties as well."

If we just step back a little bit and we think about all of the elements of our guidance, we definitely spend a lot of time thinking through that because of the strength of the quarter. 
And what I would say is, first and foremost, we're confident about the revenue guide, which we did not change. The strength of the quarter though did give us confidence to raise the EBITDA range by the $10 million, as you note. And there are a lot of moving parts. And with COVID last year, it makes for a really complicated analysis. A little bit of noise with the Connect divestiture as well, but we analyze all of that. And we thought that given that EBITDA was a little bit ahead of our expectations, but yet, there are some things that we have to be mindful of in the balance of the year. 
So if we think about this, Q2 last year was the quarter that we saw the impacts of COVID from a revenue perspective. I would also point out that we will see the return of the temporary costs, and those will start to ramp up more significantly in this current quarter because it's this time last year that we were really starting to take those costs out. 
Then also, Toni, in the balance of the year, you're going to see our investments in growth initiatives which are going to ramp. And so when you think about all of that, in addition to the optimization plan which we implemented in the second half of last year, obviously, the optimization plan served us very well in the first quarter with the margin expansion that you noted. But we will start to lap the impacts, the benefits of the optimization plan as we get into the second half of the year. So it makes for quite a bit of unevenness as we think about the revenue in relation to expense throughout the balance of the year. 
But stepping back from it all, it's in line with what we expected and all reflected in our guidance. So it's really just, as we reflected on the strength of the quarter and our consideration of the balance of the year and what we had anticipated, it's what really made sense. 
We are definitely in a growth mode right now. But as I pointed out, with the incremental investments, that are going to be a little bit lower margin as the revenue will lag the investment. And so that will be some noise that plays out in the balance of the year, all considered in our guidance. 
So I think if you step back and reflect all in all of that, it's a complicated analysis, but one that we continue to be comfortable with given permanent costs dynamic, temporary costs dynamic, COVID revenue impacts. So that was really the thought process that we went through as we analyzed how to handle guidance for the quarter."

I will take that question because I spend a lot of time on with our clients on that topic. 
Listen, I -- the whole movement to Nielsen ONE is telling the industry that we believe the audience is the audience, whether she's engaged on a streaming platform or a broadcast platform and that everybody is going to be more of a hybrid. So that means there really should be one model. And the model is closer to the historical model we've had with the linear players, which are now all digital players also. And so I think we've certainly been working with the digital players on multiyear relationships, and we have been successful there in some really important places. And on pricing, that is comparable to -- for the value. So they're going to compete with everybody else at that pricing, then the pricing from Nielsen needs to be the same as well. And so it's multiyear escalators tied to value. 
Of course, with every client, we also look at their volume and scale. So we do certainly make some arguments about future growth with our digital players. But I would say we're going to be better off to serve the industry on a level playing field with very similar terms, standard contracts, standard pricing as a subscription business. And I think we -- I hear you about, do you leave some of the exposure to the upside? Perhaps. But I think that the flip side is what the industry needs. And particularly, keep in mind, we have -- we serve the buyers as much as the sellers here, having comparability, having full coverage, meaning it's all the same, and having resiliency really does take -- put it all on the same platform with the same terms."

I guess a follow-up on that last one and the potential march toward parity and the one price for everybody methodology. This is -- this might be a foggy memory and it's several years old, but I think at one point, the Nielsen TV Audience Measurement revenue equated to somewhere around 2% of ad spend and digital was like 1% of premium digital video ad spend. And correct me if I'm incorrect, but just how wide does that gap remain? And it does sound like you think there's an opportunity to get parity, correct?"

Is this a fraud aspect of CTV or sort of ascertaining the quality of CTV impressions something that you plan to address alongside the traditional measurement? 
And my question for Linda is, now that you have a stand-alone media business and the worst of the separation headaches might be behind you, would you look to give us some improved disclosure so we can sort of measure your R&D spend or your product development spend separate from your SG&A the way we would with a lot of other companies that are in the sort of digital measurement space, and to get a better handle on what costs and what effort is sort of being put into product development of Nielsen ONE over the next couple of years?"

I'm actually going to let Karthik also step in here because he spent a lot of time on our design of the connected TV measurement. And honestly, this is why we are so robust to have this combination of big data we get from a lot of platforms, including connected TV platform, and the importance of validating that with a very robust panel sample. Because I think there have been just challenges for anyone who just tried to use big data to ever do audience measurement, and it is important to do both. 
On the other hand, there's also some specific things that others are doing. And some new companies were formed here totally around visibility or viewability. And part of what we're doing is also making this more interoperable as opposed to sort of having to launch yet another viewability standard. So we do think it's important. We do think we can work with others. I don't think we have to be in all these spaces directly. I think we're the fundamental platform for audience measurement, and we will connect with others to help make that work.

So I'll just highlight one of the things you mentioned because it's really important to understand how we integrate directly with the CTV player. I think that's where it all begins. Eventually, when the measurement of CTV goes into the entire ecosystem, so that measurement is available across all steps of the value chain, we will obviously pay a lot more. Just like in digital, we'll pay a lot more consistent attention to things like viewability and fraud. Those are important complementary metrics just like in good old digital. 
But I think our starting point is direct integrations with the CTV players, not about being connected into the intermediaries. So this way, our starting point as this measurement evolves is starting at the purest form. That's the way it's actually delivered. So this is important. But as the industry expands, as there's more ecosystem players, there's a great growth opportunity at large, that's going to be an area where then fraud, viewability, all these capabilities are going to be important bolt-ons."

And you'll see where that even what we put out today is more singularly focused on the New Nielsen and on media, and we'll look to improve from there. But I think the best analogy, Richard, would be to go back to some of what Karthik talked about at Investor Day. And he shared directionally somewhat how we're thinking about growth versus sustain as we look at our CapEx investments. Now obviously, there's a lot in the thought process from an R&D perspective. But even as we went through our strategic planning process last year, we really focused on what the return is going to be on investment. So we're continuing to introduce more rigor and refine that process. 
But if I just go back to some of the trends that Karthik shared at Investor Day. For 2020, we are kind of looking directionally at a 75-25 relationship of growth versus, let's say, sustained investments as we think about our CapEx. And in 2021, we're dialing that up significantly. We'll be looking at more of a 40-60 relationship as we think about growth versus sustain. And then as we discussed at Investor Day, we're looking to have that relationship be more of a 50-50 relationship by 2023. 
What's interesting to see playing out here is the convergence between linear and digital. And that influences the way in which we are investing. And we made very clear at Investor Day that our current priority is investing in single platform, investing in Nielsen ONE. And so suffice it to say, the lion's share of our current investments are being directed there. And we are significantly dialing up that investment in order to be where our customers and clients are in order to support the continued convergence. But that will give you a feel directionally. As far as breaking it out in the future, we'll continue to assess, but don't expect anything in the next 90 days or 6 months."

Our second quarter results demonstrate Nielsen's continued strategic and operational transformation in an evolving global media ecosystem. These results also show that we are executing as planned on the growth strategy we laid out at our Investor Day in December.
Let me remind you of the 3 overarching messages and compelling opportunity for Nielsen. First, we are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets globally. Across the board, we are delivering on the key elements of our product road map. Second, our cultural transformation is progressing well. Our associates around the globe have rallied around a growth-driven mindset, and we're benefiting from their energy, enthusiasm and clarity of focus. This means focusing on accelerating revenue growth and advancing our product evolution to match the rapid changes in audience behavior and the media ecosystem. And third, we have a compelling and strengthening financial model, with 80% recurring revenue, expanding margins and increasing free cash flow conversion.
I'll provide a high-level look at our second quarter results before turning to the business highlights. I'll then hand the call over to Linda for a more detailed review of our results.
We are building on our consistent track record of success, and we are pursuing opportunities to further improve. Year-over-year revenue grew 6.2% on an organic basis. We are seeing the benefit of a COVID recovery in some markets, although it remains uneven globally. Our teams are doing a great job serving clients around the world, even in markets that remain challenged. Our adjusted EBITDA margins of 43% expanded 256 basis points on solid revenue growth and strong cost discipline. Our adjusted EPS of $0.43 and increased from $0.35 in the prior year. And free cash flow was $190 million, up from $86 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a comparable basis. Following strong first half performance and reflecting our confidence in the 2021 outlook, we are raising the low end of our ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and also raising our EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges.
Turning to the business. I'd like to start with a high-level discussion on the value we bring to the media industry. There is no question that audiences are changing how they consume media. And platforms, networks, studios, advertisers and agencies are all transforming to meet and drive these changes. In the second quarter alone, our clients were involved in big mergers, big product launches, a robust advertising upfront and global expansion. Nielsen's 3 essential solutions: Audience Measurement, Audience Outcome and Gracenote Content Services were used by our clients to make decisions and negotiate with a common [indiscernible] navigate a changing media history. We are growing especially well with our largest global partners with 
[Audio Gap]
We and our clients increasingly invest in these 3 essential solutions, which will accelerate growth. 
[Audio Gap]
mission is to power a better media future for all people. And this includes our strong commitment to our ESG priorities and performance. In June, we released an interim responsibility update, which highlights the important work we have done around the 6 key areas of our ESG strategy. The Board and I firmly believe these efforts are essential to the overall success of our organization.
Now let me share some specifics for each of our 3 solutions. Starting with Audience Measurement, which posted 4% year-over-year organic growth. We are making significant progress on the building blocks that are foundational to Nielsen ONE, our cross-media currency solution. Industry engagement is critical to the success of Nielsen ONE, and we are partnering closely with media buyers and sellers in its development. We've launched a series of cross-functional working committees and recently met with the executive steering committee, which consists of senior industry leaders. We received good feedback on our progress against coverage, comparability and resiliency. Our work with the industry includes the ANA, the Association of National Advertisers, and the WFA, the World Federation of Advertisers. Nielsen ONE aligns with their objectives for a cross-media measurement solution that best addresses the needs of advertisers. We are also supporting the ANA's Alliance for Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing, or AIMM, to help their members measure their investments in Black, Hispanic and Asian-owned media.
We continue to be encouraged by renewals and expanded scope with both multichannel and digital pure-play clients as well as advertisers and agencies. Clients are renewing with larger contracts as they add more services. These are largely multiyear commitments with annual price escalators. Due to advertiser and agency growth examples, we'd include the extension of our Digital Ad Ratings agreement with Toyota and Dentsu's expanded relationship to include streaming measurement. On the publisher side, 9 of the top 10 TV network groups are now using our streaming measurement solutions. And just this week, Google cited Nielsen metrics on their earnings call to demonstrate the incremental reach for advertisers on their platform. 
We also recently partnered with De Zone, a global streaming sports platform, on an audience measurement tool ahead of the Italian football season. Our local video and audio business continues to strengthen. We recently renewed and expanded our agreement with Entravision, which includes a comprehensive suite of measurement services, including local TV ratings, covering their 22 market footprint, and Nielsen Audio for all radio stations in 14 markets. We also renewed a multiyear deal with iHeartMedia across all of their markets.
Let me walk through some recent product milestones for Nielsen ONE using coverage, comparability and resiliency as a framework. Starting with coverage, which we are expanding significantly. The addition of Roku as a data provider brings the aggregate number of devices measured close to 100 million, in combination with DIRECTV, DISH and VIZIO. And we've doubled the number of connected TV partners over the past year to most recently include Samsung TV Plus. When combined with our existing coverage of major platforms such as Amazon and YouTube, this will bring our big data coverage of video digital ad spend in the United States to approximately [ 3% ] 
We continue on streaming measurement also. We are expanding our base of streaming meters with approximately 14,000 installed meters as of July and broadened our coverage to include the top 15 streaming platforms. Outside the U.S., our streaming meters are now live in 6 markets, and we will continue to add markets over the next several quarters.
Next, comparability. In June, we launched The Gauge, a new monthly analytic tool that provides the industry with a simple view of time spent that is comparable across streaming, traditional cable, broadcast channels and gaming. We were, of course, pleased that Netflix's co-CEO Reed Hastings publicly acknowledge that Nielsen is uniquely positioned to help scorekeep in the dynamic media landscape and that Netflix used The Gauge to demonstrate their runway for growth in their Q2 earnings update. There is a lot of great work and progress behind the scenes on driving comparability across TV and digital.
Deduplication is a critical component, and we have recently completed a key step in this area, developing a methodology for cross-device deduplication within households. Another key milestone this year will be the integration of big data sources into Nielsen's national television measurement calibrated by our panel. These integrations are on schedule, and we're on track to have impact data by year-end that clients can use during 2022 for analytic purposes. We are also on track towards sub-minute measurement in our television panel, which will be enabled by innovation in our watermark and Signature technologies. The work to make our existing metered panel cable is near completion and expected to roll out in Q4 of this year. And finally, we remain in active discussions with the MRC, ANA, WFA, clients and other industry organizations as we build towards evolving the currency.
The last point is resiliency. As the privacy landscape continues to evolve, with third-party cookie deprecation being the most notable change, we have taken proactive steps that provide us with the flexibility to adapt, enabling us to understand the audience and audience demographics in a privacy-focused way. Earlier this week, we unveiled our cookieless approach for audience and outcomes measurement, eliminating our reliance on digital identifiers. This new approach is enabled by our Nielsen Identity which allows us to deduplicate across linear and digital platforms as a part of Nielsen ONE. A full privacy-focused redesign has already been completed for the 2 largest digital platforms. And we continue to enhance coverage of the -- recently adding new data partners such as Talon, DEX, Full Contact and ID5. And this builds on existing data relationships with NuStar, Narrative, Throttle and TrueData. I want to reiterate that all of our big data sets are validated by our robust panel, which represents an important truth set and statistically representative view of the audience in the U.S. and in key markets around the world.
As discussed on our first quarter call, during COVID, CDC and state guidelines prevented us from entering panelist homes either to sign up new panelists or maintaining existing home, and this presented an operational challenge. I'm happy to say that we have now restored payments protocols and have been improving panel and quality every week during the second quarter. We are closely engaged with the MRC, and they are up to speed on our progress. We remain committed to the MRC audit and accreditation process.
Turning to Outcomes and Content, which grew 12.6% year-over-year on an organic basis in Q2. Audience Outcomes growth is driven by geographic expansion, expanding to new verticals beyond CPG and helping media companies better sell on the outcomes they deliver. Let me start with geographic expansion. We are extending the global reach of our campaign outcomes measurement tool with the addition of Vietnam, India, Portugal, the Philippines and Switzerland, among others. We expect to be in over 40 markets by the end of the year. And earlier this month, we acquired TVTY, a leading TV attribution provider based in France, which expands our capabilities and data partnerships in Europe as well as the U.S. This tuck-in acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver cross-media outcomes as a complement to audience measurement. In terms of new verticals and capabilities, we are seeing continued traction growing our client base across a broad range of industries. We have an impressive roster of new wins in the U.S. and around the world, including industry giants such as Samsung, Microsoft and Anheuser-Busch. We recently expanded our capabilities in the important automotive vertical through a new partnership with IHS Markit to integrate their Polk Automotive Data. Initially available for addressable audience we'll expand the use cases across audience and outcomes measured over the next year.
We've expanded our NORMS database designed to establish syndicated standards for campaign outcomes measurement across platforms, which we launched last fall, to now include nondurable retail and pharma in the U.S. Finally, we have made significant progress with many of our media publishers adding outcomes metrics on top of audience measurement as they evolve the way they sell advertising. A timely example this week during the Tokyo Olympics. Our outcomes and sports teams jointly worked with the International Olympic Committee to create a new solution measuring the return on sponsorship investment for some of the IOC's top partner. This is a first in the sports market and is a good example of expanding outcomes into sponsorships.
We are evolving our core multi-touch attribution product from digital exclusive to digital first, with the addition of linear television and over the top. And we are expanding our channel coverage, which helps pinpoint the optimal spend across the entire media mix, now including the coverage of radio, print and social influencers.
And finally, turning to Gracenote Content Services, which is also growing through geographic expansion and additional solutions beyond core metadata business. We continue to see a very high renewal rate of Gracenote services. For example, we recently renewed our multiyear agreement with Verizon with a focus around streaming video services. During the second quarter, we expanded Gracenote with major clients into the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and, most recently, Poland. We are also developing new solutions to add more value off the Gracenote. Earlier this year, we launched Inquitix, empowering smarter decision-making, inclusive content investments and all things [indiscernible] and we've seen on interest service across media and advertiser clients. We also serve [indiscernible] 2 connected TV manufacturers to use Gracenote ID as a part of their advanced advertising platforms.
Let me sum up. We reported another strong quarter due to solid execution and a cultural shift to a growth mindset. We are making continued progress on our product road map, and we are driving growth across our 3 essential solutions. We are adding new clients and new markets while also bringing more services and incremental value to our existing clients. We have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook, which is reflected in our updated guidance provided today.
Let me now turn the call over to Linda to review the financials."

Similar to last quarter, my remarks today focus on our results as if the Connect sale and related $2.3 billion debt paydown that we completed earlier in the year took place at the beginning of 2020. This appro",1303,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, my remarks today focus on our results as if the Connect sale and related $2.3 billion debt paydown that we completed earlier in the year took place at the beginning of 2020. This approach helps with prior year comparisons and is consistent with how we handled Investor Day in December and our 2021 guidance. You'll find comparable prior period comparisons in the appendix of today's slide presentation.
Before I get into the results, I would just like to remind you that a year ago this time we faced our most impacted quarter from a COVID perspective, and we had recently announced our large-scale optimization plan. All of this is a relevant backdrop to these strong Q2 results I am pleased to now review with you. 
I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our second quarter revenue performance. Revenue for Q2 was $861 million, up 4.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or up 6.2% organic constant currency, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan and the sale of our advanced video advertising business to Roku earlier this year. On a reported basis, revenue grew 6.2%, which includes an FX benefit of 170 basis points. Revenue growth accelerated in both the U.S. and in international markets. We're continuing to see recovery from COVID-related pressures and strong execution by our teams around the world despite an uneven global recovery. For some perspective, despite the loss in the current year of revenue associated with business exits that were part of the 2020 optimization plan Q2 '21 revenue was higher than Q2 '19 revenue. The same was true for the first quarter, and we believe surpassing pre-pandemic revenue levels demonstrates that we are driving fundamental growth in addition to recovering from COVID impacts in 2020. Our solutions are resonating with clients across our end markets around the world.
Audience Measurement grew 3.3% constant currency and 4% on an organic base. Growth across the board and especially strong in digital measurement. As expected, pressure in our local business has subsided, with local posting positive growth for the first time in 10 quarters. As we discussed previously, our local business was down in the mid-single digits during the last 2 years due to pressure on multiyear contract renewals as we went through our local [indiscernible] And that work was completed in late 2019. We pull through those contracts and expect local to be roughly flat for the year.
Outcomes and Content grew 7.9% [indiscernible] with organic revenue up 6%. We saw improving trends in short-cycle revenue and strong growth in our sports business, both of which were hard hit in Q2 '20 due to COVID. We also continued to drive solid growth in content. The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rate. As you can see, the growth trend continued to improve nicely in the second quarter.
Turning now to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million, up 11.8% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 43% expanded 216 basis points reported or 256 basis points constant currency. On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. There are several drivers to our margins. First, operating leverage from top line growth was strong. Second, we took swift actions in late Q1 '20 and reduced temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs began to return in Q2 '21, though at a lesser pace than initially expected, but will continue to ramp as the year progresses. And third, just over a year ago, we did a restructuring or optimization plan. So the incremental year-over-year benefit of this plan is more pronounced in the first half of this year versus the second half. Adjusted EPS was $0.43 in the second quarter as compared to $0.35 in Q2 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization, offset in part by higher taxes. Our effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter. This includes $2 million in discrete items, which we add back for adjusted net income, resulting in a normalized effective tax rate of approximately 27.4%. Free cash flow was really strong at $190 million, which compares to $86 million in Q2 '20 on a pro forma basis. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA, improved working capital, in part due to strong collections and lower interest payments. These improvements were partially offset by higher tax payments, which is timing-related within 2021.
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Today, we are increasing our full year guidance to reflect our solid Q2 results and our confidence in the balance of the year. We are raising the low end of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges and raising our margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance. Let me take you through each of these items. For revenue, we narrowed the range, and we are now guiding 4% to 4.5% organic constant currency growth. We've similarly raised the low end of the range for constant currency revenue growth where we are now guiding 2.5% to 3%. For adjusted EBITDA, we are now $1.475 billion to $1.490 billion, with margins of 42.3% to 42.6%. This compares to 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 42% as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. As we discussed last quarter, our 2021 EBITDA guidance reflects an approximately $60 million benefit of the optimization plan this year and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year as well as incremental growth investments. The return of temporary costs is more heavily weighted in the balance of the year. We also began to implement the optimization plan in Q3 '20. As a result, the second half faces a more challenging comparison, and we continue to forecast margin compression in the second half of the year. We are raising and tightening our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.54 to $1.61 versus a comparable $1.45 in 2020. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the tighter adjusted EBITDA guidance range and lower depreciation and amortization, which is offset in part by a slightly higher share count. And finally, we are raising and tightening our free cash flow guidance to a range of $620 million to $650 million on solid EBITDA performance, lower interest payments and strong collections. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen has absorbed over the Connect sale agreement. Today, we are lowering our expectation for these cash costs by $20 million and now expect a range of $200 million to $220 million for the full year. [indiscernible] $4 million paid in the first [indiscernible] The vast majority of these costs are included in discontinued operations and is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs.
We ended Q2 with 3.62x net debt leverage on a pro forma basis, well on our path towards our medium-term net debt leverage target of 3 to 3.5x. Given this progress, we are lowering our year-end leverage guidance range to 3.5 to 3.7x.
To wrap up, we are pleased with our second quarter results. The strength of key underlying drivers reinforces the confidence that we have and our ability to execute on Nielsen's growth story and deliver our full year guidance and longer-term goals.
And now I'll turn the call back to Sara for the Q&A session."

And as a reminder, we launched all of our digital solutions already under a completely new backbone that is completely resilient for all the changes in the privacy environment. That was an important component. The identity spine that powers that is another component of that.
And going into your second half of the year, it's a little bit more focused on expanding coverage, which is all of the CTV covered expansions that we're launching with all the players David called them out. So those are important. They'll start to launch in Q3. And going into the rest of the year is all of the work we're doing around granularity and addressable, which is emboldened by the launch of our analytic capability, where we're putting out the national capability -- the national linear capability with big data. So you can imagine all of the flexibility and granularity that starts to add and, ultimately, pushes us into next year where there's a whole host of other things, including the deduplication methodology, which is ultimately core of where all this comes together, deduplicating every of media delivery [indiscernible] road map is complete the inputs as well as what I start to see periodically going into the rest of the year and into early next year."

So it is a team sport, but the version that we're building and have continued to build is largely around use cases of measurement. And use case new measurement is, foundationally, you can think about it as deduplicating where many different versions of exposure are difficult when you have to put them together into the duplicated reach of frequency. That's the use case that we're solving for primarily. And so interoperability and deduplication, that's what we're about, and that makes us a little bit different than the other solutions, but we're making really good progress on that."

And we're operating at a very strong pace, and we've actually increased investment to make sure that we have the panels the way it needs to be. It's a fair complaint that people would want that instantly. So I don't love the tactics, but I would agree that it is important that we resolve the panel.
The -- and on [indiscernible] how -- the second part of that though, to be clear, the accreditation is very important. We think it really builds trust in the industry, but it's a vote of confidence.

More broadly, I would say, on the demand side, the people who buy advertising, the people who invest in content, I think there's a lot more credibility that Nielsen really does measure the total audience. I think there was a narrative when I got here that maybe we were more broadcast and linear-focused. And I think it's really clear we're audience-focused, and we're following the audience wherever she goes and is going to streaming in a lot of ways in a lot of categories. So listen, it's early days, but I think this is the kind of validation leading up to Nielsen ONE and leading us to moving the whole market integrated view of the total audience across both streaming and linear on the same basis.

As we think about the second half of the year, we do still continue to expect solid revenue growth. I will point out that the first half of the year was a bit stronger than our expectations, and you see that in the guidance revisions that we've provided today. The subscription portion of our business, which is about 80% of the total, doesn't have as much variability because we've got a lot of visibility into that business. But on the outcome side of the business, there's definitely more variability. And we saw that last year and now this year with the impact of COVID. We're benefiting, though, from an improving ad market from a COVID recovery end. We're optimistic, but we're of the opinion that this pandemic is not behind us and it's an unpredictable environment. So we've incorporated a bit of risk at the low end around the speed or the pace of the global recovery.
You heard earlier from Karthik and David that we're doing well on our product road map, and execution on that is important for the second half. We do have our initiatives and growth investments that we're making, which are more second half weighted. And some of those will take a little bit of time to ramp.

Again, just going out to the strategy, 3 components there. One is vertical expansion. I think you've heard us talk multiple times about going outside of consumer packaged goods because that's where 90% of marketing dollars [indiscernible] So expanding coverage, you saw what we're doing in the automotive is you saw mentions about retail [indiscernible] That frame will continue to expand, making it even more relevant to both sides [indiscernible] but also the sellers so that they really tell the story of their inventory, not just from a volume perspective, which is reach, but also from a value perspective, which is outcomes. And so everything we've mentioned there about how we're being used -- our capabilities are being used and will continue to be used by sellers as well is an important component.
And then global expansion is a really important component because, again, everything we're doing in outcomes is about telling the story about the value of marketing. And that's relevant everywhere almost the same way. And so expanding into more markets going again into 2022.
And on the Gracenote side, just -- it's about a couple of things. One is the world of discovery is even more exciting, just given the proliferation of platforms and the new innovations in which content is being delivered to consumers. So it's a combination of market expansion as well as capability expansion, such as advanced discovery. And then the ultimate angle there for us is the expanded use of the Gracenote ID. Because in a world where content is proliferating to so many platforms, the Gracenote ID becomes a unifier to figure out exactly where that content is going and how it's being licensed. Is it being used the way it was -- is the content being used the way it was expected to? So there's a whole bunch of components there that are very exciting for us, many of those in the second half, as well as going into 2022."

So I think it's a very solid foundation.
I think the fact that it is a single platform makes it much easier to continue to innovate on.

So we're going to continue to invest. We're going to continue to improve, and we're going to continue to be transparent so that everyone can have confidence and trust in the fidelity of what we're producing.
That said, what I would also say is this changing market that we're trying to measure with Nielsen ONE is more sophisticated. It has a combination of ACR data, which is why deals like Roku are so important, why the integrations are so important. And you need that for streaming. There's still a lot of cable data, and there is an increasing number of homes that are broadband only. So us making sure we're measuring all of it is key. And I think it's certainly telling the market that the Nielsen ONE solution is going to be needed and needed as quickly as we can get it out there.
So yes, I do think it creates demand as people acknowledge the changing market. And I think we need to continue to strengthen all aspects of our data, including our panel, and be transparent about that. Karthik, do you want to add anything?"

And then a quick one for Linda. We couldn't help noticing that removing some of the other items from adjusted EBITDA, which is about $38 million this year versus $2 million last year, would have taken margins down quite a bit.

With regard to a breakdown on international versus domestic, we don't do that breakdown regularly, but if I use 2020 as a barometer, international exposure was about 17%. And I would remind you that Gracenote is a very global business. And so a meaningful portion of our international exposure is because of the global nature of that business. But we're very optimistic about international as a growth opportunity for us. So as we make our annual disclosures on the mix of domestic versus international, I would expect to see some proportion trend up, but it's on a much smaller base.

Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate Nielsen's continued strategic and operational transformation in an evolving global media ecosystem. These results also show that we are executing",2228,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate Nielsen's continued strategic and operational transformation in an evolving global media ecosystem. These results also show that we are executing as planned on the growth strategy we laid out at our Investor Day in December. 
Let me remind you of the 3 overarching messages and compelling opportunity for Nielsen. First, we are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets globally. Across the board, we are delivering on the key elements of our product road map. 
Second, our cultural transformation is progressing well. Our associates around the globe have rallied around a growth-driven mindset, and we're benefiting from their energy, enthusiasm and clarity of focus. This means focusing on accelerating revenue growth and advancing our product evolution to match the rapid changes in audience behavior and the media ecosystem. 
And third, we have a compelling and strengthening financial model with 80% recurring revenue, expanding margins and increasing free cash flow conversion. 
I'll provide a high-level look at our second quarter results before turning to the business highlights. I'll then hand the call over to Linda for a more detailed review of our results. 
We are building on our consistent track record of success, and we are pursuing opportunities to further improve. Year-over-year revenue grew 6.2% on an organic basis. We are seeing the benefit of a COVID recovery in some markets, although it remains uneven globally. Our teams are doing a great job serving clients around the world, even in markets that remain challenged. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margins of 43% expanded 256 basis points on solid revenue growth and strong cost discipline. Our adjusted EPS of $0.43 and increased from $0.35 in the prior year. And free cash flow was $190 million, up from $86 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a comparable basis. Following strong first half performance and reflecting our confidence in the 2021 outlook, we are raising the low end of our ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and also raising our EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. 
Turning to the business. I'd like to start with a high-level discussion on the value we bring to the media industry. 
There is no question that audiences are changing how they consume media. And platforms, networks, studios, advertisers and agencies are all transforming to meet and drive these changes. In the second quarter alone, our clients were involved in big mergers, big product launches, a robust advertising upfront and global expansion. Nielsen's 3 essential solutions, audience Measurement, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services, were used by our clients to make decisions and negotiate with a common fact base as they navigate a changing media industry. We are growing especially well with our largest global partners with a scalable, digital-first approach. And we are seeing our clients increasingly invest across these 3 essential solutions, which will accelerate our growth over time.  
Finally ,I'd remind you that Nielsen's mission is to power a better media future for all people. And this includes our strong commitment to our ESG priorities and performance. In June, we released an interim responsibility update, which highlights the important work we have done around the 6 key areas of our ESG strategy. The Board and I firmly believe these efforts are essential to the overall success of our organization. 
Now let me share some specifics for each of our 3 solutions. Starting with Audience Measurement, which posted 4% year-over-year organic growth. 
We are making significant progress on the building blocks that are foundational to Nielsen ONE, our cross-media currency solution. Industry engagement is critical to the success of Nielsen ONE, and we are partnering closely with media buyers and sellers in its development. We've launched a series of cross-functional working committees and recently met with the Executive Steering Committee, which consists of senior industry leaders. We received good feedback on our progress against coverage, comparability and resiliency. 
Our work with the industry includes the ANA, the Association of National Advertisers, and the WFA, the World Federation of Advertisers. Nielsen ONE aligns with their objectives for a cross-media measurement solution that best addresses the needs of advertisers. We are also supporting the ANA's Alliance for Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing, or AIMM, to help their members measure their investments in Black, Hispanic and Asian-owned media. 
We continue to be encouraged by renewals and expanded scope with both multichannel and digital pure-play clients as well as advertisers and agencies. Clients are renewing with larger contracts as they add more services. These are largely multiyear commitments with annual price escalators. 
Q2 advertiser and agency growth examples would include the extension of our Digital Ad Ratings agreement with Toyota and Dentsu's expanded relationship to include streaming measurement. On the publisher side, 9 of the top 10 TV network groups are now using our streaming measurement solutions. And just this week, Google cited Nielsen metrics on their earnings call to demonstrate the incremental reach for advertisers on their platform.  We also recently partnered with DAZN, a global streaming sports platform, on an audience measurement tool ahead of the Italian football season. 
Our local video and audio business continues to strengthen. We recently renewed and expanded our agreement with Entravision, which includes a comprehensive suite of measurement services, including local TV ratings covering their 22-market footprint and Nielsen Audio for all radio stations in 14 markets. We also renewed a multiyear deal with iHeartMedia across all of their markets. 
Let me walk through some recent product milestones for Nielsen ONE using coverage, comparability and resiliency as a framework. 
Starting with coverage, which we are expanding significantly. The addition of Roku as a data provider brings the aggregate number of devices measured close to 100 million, in combination with DIRECTV, DISH and VIZIO. And we've doubled the number of connected TV partners over the past year to most recently include Samsung TV Plus. When combined with our existing coverage of major platforms, such Hulu, Amazon and YouTube, this will bring our big data coverage of video digital ad spend in the United States to approximately 90%.  
We continue to hit milestones on streaming measurement also. We are expanding our base of streaming meters with approximately 14,000 installed meters as of July and broadened our coverage to include the top 15 streaming platforms. Outside the U.S., our streaming meters are now live in 6 markets, and we will continue to add markets over the next several quarters. 
Next, comparability. In June, we launched The Gauge, a new monthly analytic tool that provides the industry with a simple view of time spent that is comparable across streaming, traditional cable, broadcast channels and gaming. We were, of course, pleased that Netflix's co-CEO, Reed Hastings, publicly acknowledged that Nielsen is uniquely positioned to help scorekeep in the dynamic media landscape and that Netflix used The Gauge to demonstrate their runway for growth in their Q2 earnings update. There is a lot of great work and progress behind the scenes on driving comparability across TV and digital. 
Deduplication is a critical component, and we have recently completed a key step in this area, developing a methodology for cross-device deduplication within households. Another key milestone this year will be the integration of big data sources into Nielsen's national television measurement calibrated by our panel. These integrations are on schedule, and we're on track to have impact data by year-end that clients can use during 2022 for analytic purposes. We are also on track towards sub-minute measurement in our television panel, which will be enabled by innovation in our watermark and signature technologies. The work to make our existing metered panel sub-minute capable is near completion and expected to roll out in Q4 of this year. 
And finally, we remain in active discussions with the MRC, ANA, WFA, clients and other industry organizations as we build towards evolving the currency. 
The last point is resiliency. As the privacy landscape continues to evolve, with third-party cookie deprecation being the most notable change, we have taken proactive steps that provide us with the flexibility to adapt, enabling us to understand the audience and audience demographics in a privacy-focused way. 
Earlier this week, we unveiled our cookieless approach for audience and outcomes measurement, eliminating our reliance on digital identifiers. This new approach is enabled by our Nielsen identity spine, which allows us to deduplicate across linear and digital platforms as a part of Nielsen ONE. A full, privacy-focused redesign has already been completed for the 2 largest digital platforms. And we continue to enhance coverage of the identity spine, recently adding new data partners such as Toluna, DDEX, FullContact, Cint and ID5, and this builds on existing data relationships with Newstar, Narrative, Throtle and TrueData. 
I want to reiterate that all of our big data sets are validated by our robust panel, which represents an important truth set and statistically representative view of the audience in the U.S. and in key markets around the world. 
As discussed on our first quarter call, during COVID, CDC and state guidelines prevented us from entering panelist homes either to sign up new panelists or maintaining existing home, and this presented an operational challenge. I'm happy to say that we have now restored full maintenance protocols and have been improving panel size and quality every week during the second quarter. We are closely engaged with the MRC, and they are up to speed on our progress. We remain committed to the MRC audit and accreditation process. 
Turning to Outcomes & Content, which grew 12.6% year-over-year on an organic basis in Q2. Audience Outcomes growth is driven by geographic expansion, expanding to new verticals beyond CPG and helping media companies better sell on the outcomes they deliver. 
Let me start with geographic expansion. We are expanding the global reach of our campaign outcomes measurement tool with the addition of Vietnam, India, Portugal, the Philippines and Switzerland, among others. We expect to be in over 40 markets by the end of the year. And earlier this month, we acquired TVTY, a leading TV attribution provider based in France, which expands our capabilities and data partnerships in Europe as well as the U.S. This tuck-in acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver cross-media outcomes as a complement to Audience Measurement. 
In terms of new verticals and capabilities, we are seeing continued traction, growing our client base across a broad range of industries. We have an impressive roster of new wins in the U.S. and around the world, including industry giants such as Samsung, Microsoft and Anheuser-Busch. We recently expanded our capabilities in the important automotive vertical through a new partnership with IHS Markit to integrate their Polk Automotive data. Initially available for addressable audience activation, we'll expand the use cases across audience and outcomes measurement solutions over the next year. 
We have expanded our norms database designed to establish syndicated standards for campaign outcomes measurement across platforms which we launched last fall to now include nondurable retail and pharma in the U.S. 
Finally, we have made significant progress with many of our media publishers, adding outcomes metrics on top of Audience Measurement as they evolve the way they sell advertising. A timely example this week during the Tokyo Olympics. Our outcomes and Sports teams jointly worked with the International Olympic Committee to create a new solution measuring the return on sponsorship investment for some of the IOC's top partners. This is a first in the sports market and is a good example of expanding outcomes into sponsorships. 
We are evolving our core Multi-Touch Attribution product from digital exclusive to digital first with the addition of linear television and over the top. And we are expanding our channel coverage, which helps pinpoint the optimal spend across the entire media mix, now including the coverage of radio, print and social influencers. 
And finally, turning to Gracenote Content Services, which is also growing through geographic expansion and additional solutions beyond the core metadata business. 
We continue to see a very high renewal rate of Gracenote services. For example, we recently renewed our multiyear agreement with Verizon with a focus around streaming video services. During the second quarter, we expanded Gracenote with major clients into the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and, most recently, Poland. 
We are also developing new solutions to add more value off the Gracenote platform. Earlier this year, we launched Inclusion Analytics, empowering smarter decision-making around inclusive content investments and helping to drive toward a more diverse and equitable future. And we've seen on interest for this service across media, agency and advertiser clients. We also recently signed long-term deals with 2 connected TV manufacturers to use Gracenote ID as a part of their advanced advertising platforms. 
Let me sum up. We reported another strong quarter due to solid execution and a cultural shift to a growth mindset. We are making continued progress on our product road map, and we are driving growth across our 3 essential solutions. We are adding new clients and new markets while also bringing more services and incremental value to our existing clients. We have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook, which is reflected in our updated guidance provided today. 
Let me now turn the call over to Linda to review the financials."

This appro",1313,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, my remarks today focus on our results as if the Connect sale and related $2.3 billion debt paydown that we completed earlier in the year took place at the beginning of 2020. This approach helps with prior year comparisons and is consistent with how we handled Investor Day in December and our 2021 guidance. You'll find comparable prior period comparisons in the appendix of today's slide presentation. 
Before I get into the results, I would just like to remind you that a year ago this time, we faced our most impacted quarter from a COVID perspective, and we had recently announced our large-scale optimization plan. All of this is a relevant backdrop to these strong Q2 results I am pleased to now review with you. I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our second quarter revenue performance. .
Revenue for Q2 was $861 million, up 4.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or up 6.2% organic constant currency, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan and the sale of our Advanced Video Advertising business to Roku earlier this year. On a reported basis, revenue grew 6.2%, which includes an FX benefit of 170 basis points. Revenue growth accelerated in both the U.S. and in international markets. 
We're continuing to see recovery from COVID-related pressures and strong execution by our teams around the world despite an uneven global recovery. For some perspective, despite the loss in the current year of revenue associated with business exits that were part of the 2020 optimization plan, Q2 '21 revenue was higher than Q2 '19 revenue. The same was true for the first quarter, and we believe surpassing prepandemic revenue levels demonstrates that we are driving fundamental growth in addition to recovering from COVID impacts in 2020. Our solutions are resonating with clients across our end markets around the world.
Audience Measurement grew 3.3% constant currency and 4% on an organic base. Growth remains solid across the board and especially strong in digital measurement. As expected, pressure in our local business has subsided with local posting positive growth for the first time in 10 quarters. As we discussed previously, our local business was down in the mid-single digits during the last 2 years due to pressure on multiyear contract renewals as we went through our local transformation. And that work was completed in late 2019. We cycled through those contracts and expect local to be roughly flat for the year.
Outcomes & Content grew 7.9% constant currency with organic revenue up 12.6%. We saw improving trends in short-cycle revenue and strong growth in our Sports business, both of which were hard hit in Q2 '20 due to COVID. We also continued to drive solid growth in Content. The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rates. As you can see, the growth trend continued to improve nicely in the second quarter.
Turning now to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million, up 11.8% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 43% expanded 216 basis points reported or 256 basis points constant currency. On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. 
There are several drivers to our margins. First, operating leverage from top line growth was strong. Second, we took swift actions in late Q1 '20 and reduced temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs began to return in Q2 '21, though at a lesser pace than initially expected but will continue to ramp as the year progresses. And third, just over a year ago, we did a restructuring or optimization plan. So the incremental year-over-year benefit of this plan is more pronounced in the first half of this year versus the second half. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.43 in the second quarter as compared to $0.35 in Q2 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization, offset in part by higher taxes. 
Our effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter. This includes $2 million in discrete items, which we add back for adjusted net income, resulting in a normalized second quarter tax rate of approximately 27.4%. 
Free cash flow was really strong at $190 million, which compares to $86 million in Q2 '20 on a pro forma basis. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA, improved working capital, in part due to strong collections, and lower interest payments. These improvements were partially offset by higher tax payments, which is timing related within 2021.
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Today, we are increasing our full year guidance to reflect our solid Q2 results and our confidence in the balance of the year. We are raising the low end of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges and raising our margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance. Let me take you through each of these items. 
For revenue, we narrowed the range, and we are now guiding 4% to 4.5% organic constant currency growth. We've similarly raised the low end of the range for constant currency revenue growth, where we are now guiding 2.5% to 3%. 
For adjusted EBITDA, we are now $1.475 billion to $1.490 billion, with margins of 42.3% to 42.6%. This compares to 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 42% as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. As we discussed last quarter, our 2021 EBITDA guidance reflects an approximately $60 million benefit of the optimization plan this year and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year as well as incremental growth investments. The return of temporary costs is more heavily weighted in the balance of the year. We also began to implement the optimization plan in Q3 '20. As a result, the second half faces a more challenging comparison, and we continue to forecast margin compression in the second half of the year. 
We are raising and tightening our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.54 to $1.61 versus a comparable $1.45 in 2020. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the tighter adjusted EBITDA guidance range and lower depreciation and amortization, which is offset in part by a slightly higher share count. 
And finally, we are raising and tightening our free cash flow guidance to a range of $620 million to $650 million on solid EBITDA performance, lower interest payments and strong collections. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen has absorbed under the Connect sale agreement. Today, we are lowering our expectation for these cash costs by $20 million and now expect a range of $200 million to $220 million for the full year with $164 million paid in the first half of the year. The vast majority of these costs are included in discontinued operations, and this is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs.
We ended Q2 with 3.62x net debt leverage on a pro forma basis, well on our path towards our medium-term net debt leverage target of 3 to 3.5x. Given this progress, we are lowering our year-end leverage guidance range to 3.5 to 3.7x.
To wrap up, we are pleased with our second quarter results. The strength of key underlying drivers reinforces the confidence that we have in our ability to execute on Nielsen's growth story and deliver our full year guidance and longer-term goals.
And now I'll turn the call back to Sara for the Q&A session."

Nielsen ONE is foundationally about cross-media measurement and the 3 biggest components of which are obviously coverage, resiliency and comparability. Those are the sort of 3 core pillars that get us ultimately to what we are going to deliver in 2022. 
And as a reminder, we launched all of our digital solutions already under a completely new backbone that is completely resilient for all the changes in the privacy environment. That was an important component. The identity spine that powers that is another component of that.
And going into the second half of the year, it's a little bit more focused on expanding coverage, which is all of the CTV coverage expansions that we're launching with all the players. David called them out. So those are important. They'll start to launch in Q3. 
And going into the rest of the year is all of the work we're doing around granularity and [indiscernible], which is the -- which is emboldened by the launch of our analytic capability where we're putting out the national capability -- the national linear capability with big data. So you can imagine all of the flexibility and granularity that starts to add and ultimately pushes us into next year where there's a whole host of other things, including the deduplication methodology, which is ultimately the core of where all this comes together, deduplicating across every component of media delivery that takes place. So that's what we're building towards. The road map is completely on track from all of the inputs as well as what clients start to see periodically going into the rest of the year and into early next year."

So it is a team sport, but the version that we're building and have continued to build is largely around use cases of measurement. And use cases of measurement is -- foundationally, you can think about it as deduplicating where many different versions of exposure are difficult when you have to put them together into deduplicated reach of frequency. That's the use case that we're solving for primarily. And so interoperability and deduplication, that's what we're about, and that makes us a little bit different than the other solutions.

What I would say on the 50%, that really -- has more to do with which of the publishers have already been solved for. So we obviously started with the biggest ones, and they're there. We now have this solution. And in our release, we talked about the solution for the unauthenticated. For those who are smaller, who may not have as much first-party data, we're getting there with some added techniques that use the probabilistic models and machine learning.

Thanks, David. Just to reinforce what he said, we continue to work with the MRC before, during and even now that leads up typically to an accreditation process, which is largely an audit of every single process that goes into managing the panels and ultimately what gets produced from the panels into our products. So our plan is completely on track in terms of all the corrections we needed to make coming out of COVID. Even though COVID is not over, we've managed to get back into field basically completely, going and checking for all of the homes in [indiscernible] flag that we were unable to do during the peak of COVID. So our execution there to get the panel back up to where it needs to be is completely on track. 
And yes, as David said, we don't love getting the added push. But look, like we work with clients as well to showcase and tell them exactly what we're doing. And so we're completely committed, and our plans are going exactly as we planned as well as working with the MRC because they bring a lot of value to the process of reinforcing confidence in what we produce."

And they're using them to understand their market share, to understand their competitiveness, to be able to respond and make their products better. And I was really pleased to see a couple of them use them in their earnings calls because it means they're pretty core to the way they operate their businesses. And I think that's a really nice validation. 
And of course, as I said, those digital-first players are driving a lot of our growth in this post-COVID period and will continue to drive our growth given the nature of the relationship. So I feel really good about that.
More broadly, I would say, on the demand side, the people who buy advertising, the people who invest in content, I think there's a lot more credibility that Nielsen really does measure the total audience. I think there was a narrative when I got here that maybe we were more broadcast than linear focused. And I think it's really clear we're audience focused, and we're following the audience wherever she goes and is going to streaming in a lot of ways in a lot of categories. 
So listen, it's early days, but I think this is the kind of validation leading up to Nielsen ONE and leading us to moving the whole market towards an integrated view of the total audience across both streaming and linear on the same basis. And already, it's being used for decisions and for folks to manage their product strategies."

I would just start by saying that we feel good about the Q2 results. As you noted, they are really strong results. As we think about the second half of the year, we do still continue to expect solid revenue growth. 
I will point out that the first half of the year was a bit stronger than our expectations, and you see that in the guidance revisions that we've provided today. 
The subscription portion of our business, which is about 80% of the total, doesn't have as much variability because we've got a lot of visibility into that business. But on the outcome side of the business, there's definitely more variability, and we saw that last year and now this year with the impact of COVID. We're benefiting, though, from an improving ad market from a COVID recovery perspective, and we're optimistic. But we're of the opinion that this pandemic is not behind us and it's an unpredictable environment. So we've incorporated a bit of risk at the low end around the speed or the pace of the global recovery.
You heard earlier from Karthik and David that we're doing well on our product road map, and execution on that is important for the second half. We do have our initiatives and growth investments that we're making, which are more second half weighted, and some of those will take a little bit of time to ramp. But overall, we think the second half will be in line with, of course, the way that we've guided today. And I think that we, on an overall basis, are feeling very optimistic about the second half and our performance as reflected in the guidance revision."

Again, just going out to the strategy, 3 components there. One is vertical expansion. I think you've heard us talk multiple times about going outside of consumer packaged goods because that's where 90% of marketing dollars get spent, or ad dollars anyway. So expanding coverage. You saw what we're doing in the automotive space. You saw mentions about retail, nondurable retail and pharma. That trading will continue to expand. 
Then it's about making it even more relevant to both sides of the coin, not just the buyers but also the sellers so that sellers can really tell the story of their inventory not just from a volume perspective, which is reach, but also from a value perspective, which is outcomes. And so everything we've mentioned there about how we're being used, our outcome capabilities are being used and will continue to be used by sellers as well is an important component.
And then global expansion is a really important component because, again, everything we're doing in outcomes is about telling the story about the value of marketing, and that's relevant everywhere almost the same way. And so expanding into more markets going again into 2022.
And on the Gracenote side, just -- it's about a couple of things. One is the world of discovery is even more exciting just given the proliferation of platforms and the new innovations in which content is being delivered to consumers. So it's a combination of market expansion as well as capability expansion such as advanced discovery. 
And then the ultimate angle there for us is the expanded use of the Gracenote ID. Because in a world where content is proliferating to so many platforms, the Gracenote ID becomes a unifier to figure out exactly where that content is going and how it's being licensed. Is it being used the way it was -- is the content being used the way it was expected to? So there's a whole bunch of components there that are very exciting for us, many of those in the second half as well as going into 2022."

So you raised a place where I -- I think we're always going to continue to innovate and improve on the tech backbone and take advantage of the latest technologies because I think that is important. And technology as a science continues to evolve. 
What I will say is the foundation is there. The work that needed to be done from when I first got here until now to get us on a single platform to be able to be cloud based, which really means that more of your software can be composable, the ability to get things done in days and weeks, not months and years, is -- it gets better every day. So I think it's a very solid foundation.
I think the fact that it is a single platform makes it much easier to continue to innovate on. But it's going to be a never-ending process to make sure that Nielsen is at the front edge of the technology curve going forward. 
Flip side is, I would say that's really helping us with talent because people are finding that they can do really leading-edge things here, and they're pretty excited about that.

That said, what I would also say is this changing market that we're trying to measure with Nielsen ONE is more sophisticated. It has a combination of ACR data, which is why it feels like Roku were so important, why the CTV integrations are so important and that the -- you need that for streaming. There's still a lot of cable data, and there's an increasing number of homes that are broadband only. So us making sure we're measuring all of it is key. And I think it's certainly telling the market that the Nielsen ONE solution is going to be needed and needed as quickly as we can get it out there.

With regard to a breakdown on international versus domestic, we don't do that breakdown regularly. But if I use 2020 as a barometer, international exposure was about 17%. And I would remind you that Gracenote is a very global business. And so a meaningful portion of our international exposure is because of the global nature of that business. But we're very optimistic about international as a growth opportunity for us. 
So as we make our annual disclosures on the mix of domestic versus international, I would expect to see some proportion of that trend up, but it's on a much smaller base. So it will take time before you see that mix shift coming through in our numbers."

422760,1684950097,2415484,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before we dive into our strong Q3 results, I want to start by taking a step back to provide context around what is happening in the media industry, and why Nielsen is becoming even more",2699,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before we dive into our strong Q3 results, I want to start by taking a step back to provide context around what is happening in the media industry, and why Nielsen is becoming even more relevant as viewing habits continue to accelerate towards streaming. 
The media industry is going through unprecedented change only accelerated by the pandemic with an audience that is watching programming whenever, wherever and on whatever device she chooses, an industry built on linear TV programming, supported by ads is evolving to an industry that is moving to streaming content supported by subscribers and ads. 
According to our September 2021 release of the Nielsen Gage data, just over 50% of viewing took place over broadcast and cable, while streaming alone grew to 37% in the 18 to 54 demographic. This compares to 2016 when more than 75% of viewing was on broadcast or cable. 
The evolution of our solution mirrors this massive shift, and this context is important to keep in mind as you read the news. It is evident that media measurement will be dramatically different 5 years from now, and we are leading the industry's evolution despite the recent headlines. 
As the media ecosystem and audience viewing becomes more fragmented, having a single independent cross-media measurement solution across streaming, broadcast and cable is essential to the industry. Both the World Federation of Advertisers, which represents advertisers globally and the U.S.-based Association of National Advertisers have put forth principles around measurement integrity and standards. Nielsen ONE, which is focused on the future of measurement aligns with these principles. 
We have laid out a clear time line leading up to the Q4 2022 launch of Nielsen ONE and we are looking at opportunities to accelerate this. Nielsen alone is uniquely positioned to provide the industry with a currency-grade, cross-platform measurement solution. 
Let me walk you through some facts about our unique market position. First, our approach to Nielsen ONE is big data, validated by panel. Over time, we have built partnerships with a wide variety of industry participants that now give us visibility into hundreds of millions of big data inputs on TV for return path data and billions of impression connected TVs, computers and mobile devices that we combine with robust, [ open ] and audited panels to correct for biases and other limitations of Big Data. This uniquely allows us to provide persons-level measurement that is representative of the entire U.S. population -- measurement tools derived on big data alone cannot do this. 
Potential competitors who want to optimize TV may claim that they can use individual level information from other big data sources. But big data has flaws and biases. It lacks rich detail about who the people are or it underrepresents diverse populations and certain age groups big data alone might work for targeting and optimization, but it does not work for currency-grade measurement. 
Second, advertisers want independent measurement as evidenced in recent public statements by leading advertisers such as P&G and Aeiserbush, walled gardens are complex and they cannot provide the independent holistic view of the market that Nielsen does. Stitching together data sources from multiple sources using different methodology, but only further add to the complexity. 
Third, Nielsen is deeply embedded in the media ecosystem across platforms such as Mediaocean and with advertisers and publishers who want to transact on a common fact base. And finally, Nielsen is the trusted leader in the industry with a proven history of building alignment across the ecosystem of media buyers and sellers. I also specifically address our accreditation status for traditional broadcast television in the U.S. with the Media Rating Council, or MRC. 
As discussed on previous calls, during the height of the COVID pandemic, we had limited in home field work. As the pandemic continued, we made changes to adapt operationally, including changes to our maintenance procedures. We disclosed those changes and the impact on estimates and have since addressed the outstanding maintenance-related issues. This was obviously a fluid and unprecedented time for all of us. We followed MRC protocols around logging changes, but we accept the constructive criticism that we could have better communicated changes and their impact to clients. 
As a result of all these factors, MRC members voted to suspend accreditation of our national and local TV services in August. We believe in accreditation and fully support the audit process. In fact, we continue to be the only service audited across our products. We are in continuous dialogue with the MRC, and we've also engaged an external firm to support our efforts toward remediating outstanding issues. It's a methodical process and a focused work plan, all of which are aligned with the MRC's feedback. Our panel recovery efforts are well underway, and we're already back to more than 40,000 homes. We are on track to reach 41,600 homes by Q1 of 2022, which is our target, and we will continue to expand beyond that. 
The Nielsen panel remains a key differentiator. I remind you that no other provider has a representative empirical person-level panel. We will have more to share in the coming months, but I can assure you that getting reaccredited as soon as possible is a top priority. 
I would add that today, Nielsen remains the de facto audited currency. Across the board, broadcast, digital first, audio, agency and advertiser clients continue to use our currency ratings every day to the critical business as they did in this year's media upfront. We have not been perfect, but we believe in the integrity of our ratings and our high-quality panels that are foundational to measuring audiences. I am incredibly proud of the way our teams have executed over the past 18 months, demonstrating resilience and courage as we adapted to new ways of working during the global pandemic. 
And I want to thank you all for your dedication. 
You'll hear more from Linda in a few minutes, but I'd also like to touch on our third quarter financial results. We reported another strong quarter building on our track record of execution and demonstrating continued progress on our strategic growth plan. Revenue grew 6.6% on an organic basis including 4.4% growth in Audience Measurement and 12.5% growth in Outcomes & Content. Adjusted EBITDA grew [ 19% ] on a constant currency basis. Our margins remained strong at 43.3% in the third quarter. As expected, these were down year-over-year as some code temporary costs return. Adjusted EPS of $0.45 increased from $0.42 in the prior year, and free cash flow year-to-date is $514 million, up from $383 million a year ago on a comparable basis. Following our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2021 revenue and EP guidance, and we are raising the low end of our ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
Let's turn to business highlights. In Audience Measurement, we made good progress on product milestones ahead of the Q4 2022 launch of Nielsen ONE. Let me start with some recent examples using coverage, comparability and resiliency as a framework. 
Starting with coverage. Our objective is full coverage across all audio and video media and we already have the broadest coverage in the industry. We have full coverage in national and local broadcast and audio and a leading position in digital, which includes streaming services across both ads and content. 
In Digital Ad Ratings, we have the ability to measure 75% of connected TV media spend and approximately 90% of total video digital spend across computer, mobile and connected TV. 
We've expanded our coverage of streaming content, which we measure at both the platform and individual program level. Platform measurement is enabled by our streaming meter. Since launching in January 2021, we've tripled the sample size of streaming meter homes and are now at 18,000 homes. We've increased the number of platforms covered 217 from 10 earlier this year and we now cover around 85% of the entire streaming market. Our expanded sample size will allow us to track newly introduced services faster with greater stability. We're using big day validated by panels to enhance our coverage at the program level, which includes the recently completed integration on the Roku platform. This adds to the program data collected through our household panels and we've increased the number of programs measured by 30% year-to-date. 
And we are continually improving our methodology. We recently rolled out our new portable people meter wearables to better measure media consumption outside of the home. 
Next, comparability. The ultimate measure of comparability is being able to measure all content and ads in a common methodology whether it's linear or streaming. This means making TV measurement more like digital. A clear proof point is our move to a common sample as we include broadband-only homes in the local panel in January 2022. This will enable the industry's transition to trading on impression-based measurement and result in more complete, precise and representative measurement. Media sellers and buyers such as Nexstar Hurst and Magna Global, all voice support of these initiatives. 
In National, we are incorporating Big Data into the measurement, which will be validated by our panels, and we're on track to share impact data with clients in January. The big data integration will enable addressable advertising, it will increase stability and support long tail channel measurement in the currency ratings. 
As a first step, we've already shared initial evaluation data with the MRC and their TV committee. The final point is resiliency or consistency. I discussed earlier the importance of our panel in ensuring Big data is validated and fully inclusive and representative. Having a robust opt-in panel is even more important to ensure that our measurement solutions are durable and can adapt to evolving changes in the technology and privacy landscape. 
Clients see the value in our enhanced and expanded audience measurement products, and it is driving strong performance. Growth in the U.S. was led by national media clients and digital-first clients and we saw particular strength in digital products from our national media client base. Streaming is becoming increasingly important to our clients and the signification of our streaming solutions makes these products more accessible. We've had key wins with both media sellers and buyers. 
Vivo, our global video hosting service, recently expanded their agreement with an emphasis on our Digital Ad Ratings, connected TV capabilities and Apple added streaming platform ratings in addition to their current usage of content and national TV ratings. 
On the buyer side, GroupM recently leveraged our platform ratings in a thought leadership piece for global marketers. And in fact, 14 top agencies are using Nielsen's content ratings. The shift to streaming is creating a greater need for cross media measurement globally. Sweden is the latest example. There, Nielsen has recently been endorsed as their full-service provider of cross-media measurement. 
In the U.S., the enhanced value and belief in the Nielsen ONE road map continues to drive strong renewals. This year, we've renewed important contract across national, local, audio, digital and agency clients. Both Meredith Corporation and White Heart, a broadcast and digital media agency, recently renewed in mobile TV. 
Turning to outcomes and content, which grew 12.5% year-over-year on an organic basis. In Audience Outcomes, we help clients across the marketing cycles, plan, analyze and maximize their marketing investments. Just as in Audience Measurement, advertisers are looking for common metrics to help drive decision-making in a complex environment. We are focused on driving growth through market and vertical expansion, and we are demonstrating success. We are connecting our cross-media measurement to outcomes, which only Nielsen can do. 
Starting with market expansion, we're pleased with our July acquisition of TVTY, a leading TV attribution provider, and we're focused on leveraging Nielsen synergies to sign on new clients in the U.S. and Europe. We are expanding our industry coverage of our predictive ROI tools, which are used by advertisers, agencies and media owners and now cover more than 75 countries globally. 
We are deepening our penetration with advisers across a broad range of industries. We further grew our relationship with Microsoft and in the retailer vertical, we're working with Petco to help fuel their media investment decisions. 
In Europe, we're working with real money transfer in the financial services sector. And in Asia Pacific, we won [indiscernible] Avid in health care, Mediaocean wellness and Centurion Spirit. 
In sports, we see continued stronger partnerships around critical sports intelligence. We expanded our relationship with FIFA to help them enhance their commercial strategy, and we work model on their 2021 Olympics investment. 
Earlier this week, we announced a new offering that uses proprietary Nielsen data to help college sports teams demonstrate the marketing value of their athletic program with Duke Men's basketball signing on as the first client. 
Our global capabilities uniquely makes us a strong partner for global platforms. We recently entered into an agreement with Spotify, who is using our media planning software in 18 markets to help them understand the incremental reach on their platform. 
And we're also working with TikTok in various markets around the globe to help them demonstrate the effectiveness of their platform. 
On the product side, we launched new formats of total media resonate, our upward funnel offering that leads an advertisers' media plan to brand metrics with a faster solution for advertisers and a new offering for media owners. We also went live with our cloud-native multi-touch attribution offering. 
Turning to Outcomes & Content Services. We are the market leader in metadata, and we are building on our global leadership position with geographic expansion and new solutions beyond the core metadata business. 
In the U.S., Gracenote is now contracted with all of the top 10 MVPDs as measured by subscribers having acquired 2 additional providers earlier this year. 
In our top European markets, our market share is just under 20%, which provides a strong runway for growth because the remainder of the market is highly fragmented internal or point solutions. We've continued to win new business, and we are poised to accelerate our market share as we migrate new clients in 2022, extend into incremental geographies and and increase our customer coverage in the markets in which we already operate. The U.S. and Europe are our largest markets, but we also have particular strength in Australia, Brazil and Mexico and several other big markets are in development. 
Ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we published the Gracenote virtual metal table, forecasting which countries will take home metals enabling clients to deliver Olympic-focused stories across digital and broadcast properties. 
On client wins, we renewed our relationship with LG, adding services to help them expand their global service coverage and enhance the quality of their service. We are focused on the Gracenote ID becoming the universal solution for discovering content, and its content spend continues to grow. This creates opportunities to help content distributors better represent their programs in search and better understand and manage their catalogs. The ultimate goal is for the Gracenote ID to serve as a unifier across all content, similar to a UPC code in the retail industry to help clients answer key questions around licensing and distribution. 
Let me sum up. I opened the call discussing the massive shift in audiences and its impact on all of our clients, which is creating opportunity for Nielsen. In Audience Measurement, we are solving for a critical need in the industry with the development of Nielsen ONE. In outcomes and content, we are helping clients to maximize their investments in advertising and drive their content strategies. As you may have seen, we recently unveiled our new brand identity, which reflects the ongoing transformation of our culture and redefined strategy. And you'll see us continue to sharpen the narrative around the core strengths that differentiate Nielsen in the marketplace. 
Our purpose is to power a better media future for all people. We're well positioned to do so as the information services market leader for the media ecosystem. I look forward to keeping you updated on our continued progress. 
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to review the financials."

Similar to the last 2 quarters, I'd like to provide a relevant backdrop to the strong Q3 results that I'm pleased to share with you today. First, my remarks today focus on our results as of the Connect sale",1353,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Similar to the last 2 quarters, I'd like to provide a relevant backdrop to the strong Q3 results that I'm pleased to share with you today. 
First, my remarks today focus on our results as of the Connect sale we completed earlier this year in March and the resulting $2.3 billion debt pay down took place at the beginning of 2020, which helps with the year-over-year comparisons. 
Second, I want to remind you of the strength of our business with 80% contracted revenue headed into any given year, and that accreditation is not a requirement of our contracts. That being said, as David noted, regaining accreditation is a top priority. 
I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our third quarter revenue performance. Revenue for Q3 was $882 million, up 5.1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, are up 6.6% organic, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan, the April sale of our advanced video advertising business to Roku and the recent acquisition of TB TY in July. Reported revenue grew 5.5%, which includes an FX benefit of 40 basis points. Revenue growth accelerated in the U.S. and remained solid in international markets. 
Of note, this quarter represents a high watermark for Q3 revenue in spite of revenue loss as a part of business exits over the past year. The return of COVID-impacted revenue also contributed to stronger revenue growth. Audience Measurement revenue of $637 million was up 3.7% constant currency and 4.4% organic digit growth with National Media clients and double-digit growth from digital clients. 
Local posted another quarter of positive growth, but coupled with a weak Q1, we still expect local to be roughly flat for the year. 
Outcomes & Content revenue of $245 million grew 8.9% constant currency with organic revenue up 12.5%.-- We continue to see some improving trends in short-cycle revenue and strong growth in our sports business. We also continue to drive solid growth in content. The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rate. As you can see, the growth trend continued to improve in the third quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $382 million, up 2.1% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 1.9% constant currency. Following strong margin expansion in the first half of the year, we reported adjusted EBITDA margins of 43.3% during the quarter, down 143 basis points reported or 139 basis points constant currency year-over-year. 
This contraction was in line with our expectations. As we have discussed in prior quarters, there are several factors impacting our margins in 2021 that explain our year-over-year margin expansion in the first half of the year and compression in the second half of the year. 
First, because our cost base is relatively fixed, revenue growth drives operating leverage. Second, in early 2020, we reduced temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs began to return in Q2, though at a lesser pace than initially expected with the prolonged pandemic. And while they continue to increase in Q3 they have not reached the levels we expect when the pandemic is fully behind us. So we expect these costs to continue to trend up in Q4 and into 2022.
 Third, we began to implement our restructuring or optimization plan in Q3 '20. As a result, we saw significant year-over-year benefit in first half margins but the third quarter margin did not see the same kind of benefit on a year-over-year basis, and we'll continue to see this play out in the quarter due to the timing of the optimization initiatives that phased in during the second half of 2020. 
On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. Adjusted EPS was $0.45 in the third quarter, up from $0.42 in Q3 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization. 
Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis was 22% in the quarter. This included $8 million in discrete benefits primarily related to audit settlements and state funds. When we adjust for this, our normalized third quarter effective tax rate was approximately 27%, which is in line with the normalized effective tax rate on a year-to-date basis. Our year-to-date free cash flow is $514 million as compared to $383 million in the prior year period. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA and lower interest payments. These improvements were partially offset by higher tax payments. 
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Today, we are increasing elements of our full year guidance to reflect our solid Q3 results and our confidence in the balance of the year. We are raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and raising the low end of our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges. 
Let me take you through each of these. For revenue, we are raising the range to 4.5% to 4.75% for organic growth and to 3% to 3.25% for constant currency growth. This is above the guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5% organic revenue growth for the year that we communicated back in February, demonstrating our ability to successfully manage through the COVID recovery. Our updated guidance reflects the year-to-date strength and growth outlook for the fourth quarter, which faces a tougher comparison versus Q3 as COVID pressures on revenue began to subside in the fourth quarter of 2020. We remain optimistic about driving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth next year and beyond, in line with our medium-term targets. 
For adjusted EBITDA, we are now guiding $1,480 million to $1,490 million and maintaining our margin outlook of 42.3% to 42.6%. This compares to 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 42% as of the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. Our 2021 EBITDA guidance reflects the benefit of the optimization plan, underlying efficiency of the business and improved cost discipline, partially offset the return of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year and incremental investments and initiatives to drive growth over time. 
I'd remind you that COVID temporary costs have been coming back at a slower pace than initially expected we have been using some of that favorability to invest in the business this year, including investing in our panel and in growth initiatives. When we consider the dynamics that will lead to fourth quarter margin compression, they are similar to those impacting the third quarter and include the return of COVID temporary costs, growth investment and less of a year-over-year benefit from the optimization plan began in July of 2020. 
We are raising and tightening our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.65 to $1.70 versus a comparable $1.45 in 2020. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the tighter adjusted EBITDA guidance range and lower depreciation and amortization. And finally, we are raising the low end of our free cash flow guidance by $10 million to a range of $630 million to $650 million on solid year-to-date performance. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen bears under the Connect sale agreement. We now expect approximately $200 million of full year versus our prior forecast of $200 million to $220 million -- $179 million paid in the first 9 months of the year operations, and this is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs. We've made terrific progress during the year, strengthening our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with [ $3.5 million ] on the path towards our medium-term target range of 3 to 3.5x. 
As we approach the target, we will be well positioned to think more broadly about deploying capital. 
To wrap up, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results, and we are confident in our ability to execute on our growth plan. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sara for Q&A."

One of the criticisms of Nielsen has always been that you to exaggerate the point. People say that you define the meeting industry terms based on the small household panel, which you extrapolate. But you do have access to a lot of big data that you then run through the panel. So my question is, can you talk a little bit more about how this setup compares with some of the other competitors out there in terms of the scope, the size, the availability, the access to that data that you have?"

So let me start with linear. The best big data there for television is return path data. which, of course, we have from our partnerships with the satellite folks and good cable on the local side. And on the audi",514,"Certainly. Thank you for the question, Tim. So let me start with linear. The best big data there for television is return path data. which, of course, we have from our partnerships with the satellite folks and good cable on the local side. And on the audio side, then I'm from connected cars, which is something we're in discussion with the auto manufacturers On. It's the same RPD data for other models. So I think the difference between our approach and others who use RPD data is that we then validate that data with the panel because there are errors in it. There are places where the set-top box might be on and the TV is off. There are certainly no ability to append that back to actual people with had a statistical panel to put people on the overlay. So I would say we add to it with the panel. I think we make it better as a result than just using it in a raw form. 
In the streaming side, it's important to have ACR data. And I would say streaming is important, even -- the streaming approach and the ACR focus is even important for linear today. Keep in mind that 4 out of 10 households no longer have a cable subscription. 
So by definition, there's no set-top box. So you've got to get that through signals. all our signals that come off the TV. And we're unique in pulling that together. And then if it goes through a streaming platform like Roku, of course, with that deal announced earlier this year, we have added value there. 
There are other players who also use ACR data, a lot of that IP came from Gracenote. We certainly have real leadership in the technology. And I think we do it exceptionally well. And again, we can validate all that with empirical evidence from the panel. 
So last, yes, a great question. So sorry to go along. But the last thing I'd want to say about being the only party that has empirical evidence with the panel. That is a proven technique throughout data science today. I came to Nielsen after a decade in machine learning and artificial intelligence, couple of relevant examples that might be useful to you. One is vaccines. So I was used to get to a COVID vaccine much faster than ever before. Big Data certainly helped, but it was really important to have empirical panel of clinical trials so that real people were tested and those models were improved. And it absolutely would have been a disaster without taking the time for empirical data. 
Similarly, AI has vastly improved weather forecasting. But when it's really important, like a hurricane, you still get empirical data by flying hurricane hunters into storms to take real-world evidence, and you still validate those models every day with weather balloons and satellites. So we can go on and on, but I would just say nobody has a big data advantage on us and nobody has our advantage with empirical evidence to validate that data"

If you just reflect on 2020 versus 2021, we do face tougher comparisons even in Q4 versus Q3,because COVID was most impactful to us in Q2 and Q3 of last year. 
More broadly, there is still uncertainty around the pandemic -- And I would say that some global supply chain challenges are out there and that starts to raise questions about how this might impact short-term spending in the balance of the year. It could be favorable or it could be an unfavorable. But with the pandemic still looming, we are just being very smart about the way that we're setting our guidance, again, full year guidance. But as you backed into the fourth quarter. 
I would say, too, that overall, we've been pleased with our renewals this year, and for that reason that we do still feel optimistic about our medium-term guide on mid-single-digit organic revenue.

I'll just reinforce the transformation of the product is fairly broad and began pretty much beginning of this year with transforming our digital product to use an actual identity backbone that we built in 2022. So that sort of think of that as a first step to building all of digital measurement, which will also affect anything delivered over IP. So that entire body of work has gone really well, it continues to go well. I'd say the next big thing is increasing our coverage, and you've seen a whole lot of announcements around our expansion to measure connected TVs. David called out a few metrics, but that program continues to go really well. Our capability is now help us cover pretty much 75% of CTV that's out there, and we will continue to expand that. Then comes the actual work on the traditional rating, which is what we would call linear broadcast. And the big move there is incorporating big data to drive obviously much more breadth, depth, granularity by also leveraging the panels there. So that is on track. January '22 is when we start to put that out there in the marketplace at sales for the market to start to play around with it and get a feel for it. It will have a pretty much a year of prior year data so that people can use and learn from the change in the obvious methodology and the scale of the product. and then continuing to expand the rollout of meters through the panel. Like we said, the panel is an important component to make sure the meters capture things sub minutes, which is important ultimately to the vision of driving de-duplicated cross-media currency, which by putting it all together is our time line for end of 2022. So everything is progressing like we have wanted. And I'll just also go out and say we're looking at every opportunity to accelerate because that's what clients are asking us for. But we feel very optimistic and are excited not just by the progress we made, but also the milestones that we will hit as we have so far in the last 18 months. Thank you."

There are a lot of moving parts on margin as well. And maybe I'll just kind of take you back to last year. First, on revenue, we had the most pronounced COVID loss in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. And those declines started to lessen as we move into Q4 last year. And then to your point, we did take actions early in 2020 and really protect our margins at that time, and we cut a lot of temporary costs and that had a range of different underlying levers as you referenced from executive salaries to 401(k) contributions. We have furloughs. And of course, G&E is every company that's been faced by this pandemic had. 
And so that was about $100 million of temporary costs. And costs started to come back in early 2021, but they've come back at a slower pace. And that has given us some flexibility to continue to invest in the business, and it gave us the flexibility to invest in both growth initiatives and our panel restoration activities. So we felt really, really good about the additional flexibility that, that gave us. But we do expect those costs to continue to return the temporary costs into Q4. And if I just use T&E as a directional example, we're pretty much seeing those costs. They're at a very low level, record low level, but we're pretty much seeing those costs double each quarter. And so I think that's probably a pretty good indication of how but surely, we are recovering from this pandemic. 
The other thing that I think is important to mention, Greg, is optimization plan that we implemented last year. And again, as I referenced earlier, we implemented that plan really to protect our margins last year. And we've got the margins laid out in our deck on Page 8. But if you actually saw the Q2 '20 margins, they were considerably lower at 40.8%. And so when we implemented that plan, it gave us a really nice lift on the margin in the balance of 2020. But most of the initiatives played out in the second half of 2020, and they were phased in. And so we'll -- we saw the most benefit that optimization plan in Q4 last year. And of course, in the second half year, we're lapping that program. We are continuing to make investments and feel good overall about where things stand. But as a result of all of this, we do anticipate that the margin compression will be greater in Q4 than in Q3. 
I would note that we raised the low end of our 2021 EBITDA guidance, and we maintained our full year margin forecast, which is the 42.3 to the 42.6 but as a point of reference, that compares to a pro forma margin of 42% in 2020. So very strong margins overall."

So we are very confident in the product strategy and the role the panel and its components play in that. But what we're working on immediately is just to get the remediation plan executed, which was sort of call out as the cause for the accreditation challenges we've had. So that's the way we're thinking about it. 
Again, last thing I'll just point out is different components of our panel augment the overall capability. So when you think about the role of streaming platforms and being able to provide robust data there, that's where things like the streaming meter, make a huge difference, right?

And bringing together everybody across optimization, analytics and measurement is a good thing. So we were glad to participate in that process and actually get called out specifically as being an important player to help with the evolution. So I want to say there's good intent. 
Beyond that, though, what I would say is where I started today's remarks with the change in industry, it's dramatic. I mean the fact that over 5 years, 1/3 of the total time spent on linear has gone away. The fact that we now have 4 out of 10 households no longer having a cable subscription. That fundamentally means no matter what I do, the ratings for the cable channels are close to 0 on the linear side. And it causes everyone to compete for the other half, which is dominantly streaming. That's going to change measurement. That's going to cause people to really want to step up and expand those answers. 
And I would say as their transition points like the introduction of cable channels, then the introduction of the VCR, the early growth not only treating the digital broadly, there's always noise about the measurement until people settle down. So I do think there is some noise now. And I think there are some constructive criticism around COVID that we're taking seriously and improving. 
But I also think the noise will die down as things settle into a new state. And that state is going to be predominantly driven by streaming for most content. I think live events continue to have a role in broadcast. And so you end up with a live event world dominated by sports and an entertainment world driven by streaming. We're going to measure both. We're going to make them comparable. And as we do that, we're going to serve the industry and people will move on."

And that revenue return, but it's not fully back to what we would have hoped that it would be. Sports is a good example where things just aren't quite the way they were pre-COVID and then as I referenced in my prepared remarks, we're seeing -- and in response to one of the questions, the whole supply chain situation bear some relevance in our outcome space with regard to what kind of spend we might see in the near term by our clients in that space. 
And David referenced as did I, how pleased we are with growth in national and then our digital-first clients are also showing really strong growth. 
And I would point out, too, that we're seeing growth around the world. We're certainly seeing strong growth, and it accelerated in the U.S., and we're seeing very solid growth in our international markets as well. 
On a reported basis, Jeff, I would just remind you that there were some businesses that we also exited as a part of our optimization plan. And so you still see that revenue on a reported basis in the prior year, and they were lower-growth businesses, generally speaking. 
And I think we're starting to see the benefit of our growth initiatives, and we feel good also about renewals that we've done during the course of the year. 
So it's a combination of all of those that caused us to feel really good about the outlook from a revenue perspective. 
With regards to leverage, we are approaching the high end of what we've guided as our medium-term range, having ended the quarter at 3.15x net debt. 
As far as deploying capital, we feel like we now have a range of options in front of us, but we're going to be very thoughtful about it. And we're definitely going to look at what can give us the highest return on our capital. We work hard to grow that capital, and we want to make sure that we're deploying it in a very smart way. And we are in the midst right now of our annual planning cycle. And we're in ongoing dialogue with the Board about ways in which to deploy that capital. We like investing in the business right now, and you've seen some of that play out during the course of the year. We will consider tuck-in M&A as we've described in the past. And then certainly, return of capital to shareholders is an option. And it's just really nice to be having the level of flexibility where we can start thinking in earnest about that range of options, and we're very excited about that."

So we are certainly getting feedback today, not just on the estimates which",626,"Great. So to be clear, there are clients we're engaging with today, agencies, digital platforms, advertisers and, of course, publishers and networks because it affects everybody. So we are certainly getting feedback today, not just on the estimates which we produce, but also improving the workflow. And as Karthik talked about earlier, the ecosystem really matters because we're -- Nielsen is so uniquely and deeply embedded into the transactional systems, the invoicing containment systems, if you will, that and reconciliation that we need to make sure that all evolves with us. And so that's happening. And we will continue to hit key milestones on big data, so some of that we're sharing right now. We started with the MRC, and we shared it with clients. So they can see as big data is in the national measurement, what that looks like and how it feels more stable and robust. So we'll continue to share it. It will continue to be iterative. And this is why earlier we talked to you about 24. We hope to have everything -- I would say we really plan to have everything operational by Q4 of next year. It will come through as once that happens, then people will be able to use it and they'll also have the legacy system to compare so that they can manage. But our hope is to move everything to the new system and not maintain an old and a new version as of next year. 
I think the other thing that we're engaging with the industry on is getting everybody to a common data set that actually will help. That was a big lift for the local market to make sure that we could add all the broadband-only homes in there. Those are homes that have neither a cable subscription or an antenna. So it's not producing a lot of local volume, but it needed to be there to be able to measure everything off the same system and quite honestly in order to move to impressions for local. So we're getting there across the board. And I think that announcement was indicative of where we'll be in the future. When we announced, we had 2 of the big station owners and 2 of the big agencies endorse it. And we're going to continue to work that way more arm in arm with the industry in the rollout of Nielsen ONE throughout next year. So that's part one. 
In terms of the mix, I'll remind you where we were at Investor Day, and it hasn't changed much, and 49% of our revenue was from global media companies, and that includes the digital pure plays. Another I guess, 26% was from the local players, audio and video. So that would add up to about 3/4 of the revenue coming from the supply side or the publisher side. However, and I think this is important for people to remember that's the revenue, but that's not the leverage in the system. To be clear, advertisers decide what currency they want to transact on. You've seen people put out press releases that they've got some new measurement system now use. That can be done. But what really matters is what measurement system the buyer chooses to use. 
So I would say our focus as a company is focused on adding value to the industry with the best measurement. And the advertisers and agencies have an enormous role in our economics because they're the ones who are demanding the currency that best serves their purposes. And quite honestly, the currency that best gives them the answer they need. So we have to continue to work with both sides on an equal basis. Thanks for the question, Matt. Very insightful."

422760,1684950097,2415758,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before we dive into our strong Q3 results, I want to start by taking a step back to provide context around what is happening in the media industry, and why Nielsen is becoming even more",2720,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before we dive into our strong Q3 results, I want to start by taking a step back to provide context around what is happening in the media industry, and why Nielsen is becoming even more relevant as viewing habits continue to accelerate towards streaming. 
The media industry is going through unprecedented change only accelerated by the pandemic with an audience that is watching programming whenever, wherever and on whatever device she chooses. An industry built on linear TV programming, supported by ads is evolving to an industry that is moving to streaming content supported by subscribers and ads. 
According to our September 2021 release of the Nielsen Gauge data, just over 50% of viewing took place over broadcast and cable, while streaming alone grew to 37% in the 18 to 54 demographic. This compares to 2016 when more than 75% of viewing was on broadcast or cable. 
The evolution of our solution mirrors this massive shift, and this context is important to keep in mind as you read the news. It is evident that media measurement will be dramatically different 5 years from now, and we are leading the industry's evolution despite the recent headlines. 
As the media ecosystem and audience viewing becomes more fragmented, having a single, independent cross-media measurement solution across streaming, broadcast and cable is essential to the industry. Both the World Federation of Advertisers, which represents advertisers globally and the U.S.-based Association of National Advertisers have put forth principles around measurement integrity and standards. 
Nielsen ONE, which is focused on the future of measurement aligns with these principles. We have laid out a clear time line leading up to the Q4 2022 launch of Nielsen ONE and we are looking at opportunities to accelerate this. Nielsen alone is uniquely positioned to provide the industry with a currency-grade, cross-platform measurement solution. 
Let me walk you through some facts about our unique market position. First, our approach to Nielsen ONE is big data, validated by panel. Over time, we have built partnerships with a wide variety of industry participants that now give us visibility into hundreds of millions of big data inputs on TV for return path data and billions of impression connected TVs, computers and mobile devices that we combine with robust, opt-in and audited panels to correct for biases and other limitations of big data. This uniquely allows us to provide persons-level measurement that is representative of the entire U.S. population. Measurement tools derived on big data alone cannot do this. 
Potential competitors who want to optimize TV may claim that they can use individual-level information from other big data sources. But big data has flaws and biases. It lacks rich detail about who the people are or it underrepresents diverse populations and certain age groups. Big data alone might work for targeting and optimization, but it does not work for currency-grade measurement. 
Second, advertisers want independent measurement as evidenced in recent public statements by leading advertisers such as P&G and Anheuser-Busch. Walled gardens are complex and they cannot provide the independent holistic view of the market that Nielsen does. Stitching together data sources from multiple sources using different methodology would only further add to the complexity. 
Third, Nielsen is deeply embedded in the media ecosystem across buying platforms such as Mediaocean and with advertisers and publishers who want to transact on a common fact base. And finally, Nielsen is the trusted leader in the industry with a proven history of building alignment across the ecosystem of media buyers and sellers. 
I also specifically address our accreditation status for traditional broadcast television in the U.S. with the Media Rating Council, or MRC. As discussed on previous calls, during the height of the COVID pandemic, we had limited in-home field work. As the pandemic continued, we made changes to adapt operationally, including changes to our maintenance procedures. We disclosed those changes and the impact on estimates and have since addressed the outstanding maintenance-related issues. 
This was obviously a fluid and unprecedented time for all of us. We followed MRC protocols around logging changes, but we accept the constructive criticism that we could have better communicated changes and their impact to clients. 
As a result of all these factors, MRC members voted to suspend accreditation of our national and local TV services in August. We believe in accreditation and fully support the audit process. In fact, we continue to be the only service audited across our products. 
We are in continuous dialogue with the MRC, and we've also engaged an external firm to support our efforts toward remediating outstanding issues. It's a methodical process and a focused work plan, all of which are aligned with the MRC's feedback. Our panel recovery efforts are well underway, and we're already back to more than 40,000 homes. We are on track to reach 41,600 homes by Q1 of 2022, which is our target, and we will continue to expand beyond that. 
The Nielsen panel remains a key differentiator. I remind you that no other provider has a representative, empirical person-level panel. We will have more to share in the coming months, but I can assure you that getting reaccredited as soon as possible is a top priority. 
I would add that today, Nielsen remains the de facto audited currency. Across the board, broadcast, digital-first, audio, agency and advertiser clients continue to use our currency ratings every day to drive critical business as they did in this year's media upfront. We have not been perfect, but we believe in the integrity of our ratings and our high-quality panels that are foundational to measuring audiences. 
I am incredibly proud of the way our teams have executed over the past 18 months, demonstrating resilience and courage as we adapted to new ways of working during the global pandemic. And I want to thank you all for your dedication. 
You'll hear more from Linda in a few minutes, but I'd also like to touch on our third quarter financial results. We reported another strong quarter, building on our track record of execution and demonstrating continued progress on our strategic growth plan. 
Revenue grew 6.6% on an organic basis including 4.4% growth in Audience Measurement and 12.5% growth in Outcomes & Content. Adjusted EBITDA grew  on a constant currency basis. Our margins remained strong at 43.3% in the third quarter. As expected, these were down year-over-year as some code temporary costs return. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.45 increased from $0.42 in the prior year, and free cash flow year-to-date is $514 million, up from $383 million a year ago on a comparable basis. Following our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2021 revenue and EPS guidance, and we are raising the low end of our ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
Let's turn to business highlights. In Audience Measurement, we made good progress on product milestones ahead of the Q4 2022 launch of Nielsen ONE. Let me start with some recent examples using coverage, comparability and resiliency as a framework. 
Starting with coverage. Our objective is full coverage across all audio and video media, and we already have the broadest coverage in the industry. We have full coverage in national and local broadcast and audio and a leading position in digital, which includes streaming services across both ads and content. 
In Digital Ad Ratings, we have the ability to measure 75% of connected TV media spend and approximately 90% of total video digital spend across computer, mobile and connected TV. We've expanded our coverage of streaming content, which we measure at both the platform and individual program level. 
Platform measurement is enabled by our streaming meter. Since launching in January 2021, we've tripled the sample size of streaming meter homes and are now at 18,000 homes. We've increased the number of platforms covered to 17 from 10 earlier this year and we now cover around 85% of the entire streaming market. Our expanded sample size will allow us to track newly introduced services faster with greater stability. 
We're using big data validated by panels to enhance our coverage at the program level, which includes the recently completed integration on the Roku platform. This adds to the program data collected through our household panels and we've increased the number of programs measured by 30% year-to-date. 
And we are continually improving our methodology. We recently rolled out our new Portable People Meter wearables to better measure media consumption outside of the home. 
Next, comparability. The ultimate measure of comparability is being able to measure all content and ads in a common methodology whether it's linear or streaming. This means making TV measurement more like digital. A clear proof point is our move to a common sample as we include broadband-only homes in the local panel in January 2022. This will enable the industry's transition to trading on impression-based measurement and result in more complete, precise and representative measurement. Media sellers and buyers such as Nexstar, Hearst and MAGNA Global, all voice support of these initiatives. 
In National, we are incorporating big data into the measurement, which will be validated by our panels, and we're on track to share impact data with clients in January. The big data integration will enable addressable advertising, it will increase stability and support long tail channel measurement in the currency ratings. 
As a first step, we've already shared initial evaluation data with the MRC and their TV committee. The final point is resiliency or consistency. I discussed earlier the importance of our panel in ensuring big data is validated and fully inclusive and representative. Having a robust opt-in panel is even more important to ensure that our measurement solutions are durable and can adapt to evolving changes in the technology and privacy landscape. 
Clients see the value in our enhanced and expanded audience measurement products, and it is driving strong performance. Growth in the U.S. was led by national media clients and digital-first clients and we saw particular strength in digital products from our national media client base. Streaming is becoming increasingly important to our clients and the simplification of our streaming solutions makes these products more accessible. We've had key learnings with both media sellers and buyers. 
Vevo, our global video hosting service, recently expanded their agreement with an emphasis on our Digital Ad Ratings, connected TV capabilities, and Apple added streaming platform ratings in addition to their current usage of content and national TV ratings. On the buyer side, GroupM recently leveraged our platform ratings in a thought leadership piece for global marketers. And in fact, 14 top agencies are using Nielsen's content ratings. 
The shift to streaming is creating a greater need for cross media measurement globally. Sweden is the latest example. There, Nielsen has recently been endorsed as their full-service provider of cross-media measurement. 
In the U.S., the enhanced value and belief in the Nielsen ONE road map continues to drive strong renewals. This year, we've renewed important contracts across national, local, audio, digital and agency clients. Both Meredith Corporation and Whitehardt, a broadcast and digital media agency, recently renewed in mobile TV. 
Turning to Outcomes & Content, which grew 12.5% year-over-year on an organic basis. In Audience Outcomes, we help clients across the marketing cycles, plan, analyze and maximize their marketing investments. Just as in Audience Measurement, advertisers are looking for common metrics to help drive decision-making in a complex environment. We are focused on driving growth through market and vertical expansion, and we are demonstrating success. We are connecting our cross-media measurement to outcomes, which only Nielsen can do. 
Starting with market expansion, we're pleased with our July acquisition of TVTY, a leading TV attribution provider, and we're focused on leveraging Nielsen synergies to sign on new clients in the U.S. and Europe. We are expanding our industry coverage of our predictive ROI tools, which are used by advertisers, agencies and media owners, and now cover more than 75 countries globally. 
We are deepening our penetration with advisers across a broad range of industries. We further grew our relationship with Microsoft. And in the retailer vertical, we're working with Petco to help fuel their media investment decisions. In Europe, we're working with Ria Money Transfer in the financial services sector. And in Asia Pacific, we've won [ Avon ] in health care, MitoQ in wellness and Suntory in spirits. 
In sports, we see continued stronger partnerships around critical sports intelligence. We expanded our relationship with FIFA to help them enhance their commercial strategy, and we worked with Mondelez on their 2021 Olympics investment. 
Earlier this week, we announced a new offering that uses proprietary Nielsen data to help college sports teams demonstrate the marketing value of their athletic program. Earlier this week, we announced a new offering that uses proprietary Nielsen data to help college sports teams demonstrate the marketing value of their athletic program with Duke Men's basketball signing on as the first client.  
Our global capabilities uniquely makes us a strong partner for global platforms. We recently entered into an agreement with Spotify, who is using our media planning software in 18 markets to help them understand the incremental reach on their platform. And we're also working with TikTok in various markets around the globe to help them demonstrate the effectiveness of their platform. 
On the product side, we launched new formats of Total Media Resonance, our upward funnel offering that leads an advertisers' media plan to brand metrics with a faster solution for advertisers and a new offering for media owners. We also went live with our cloud-native multi-touch attribution offering. 
Turning to Outcomes & Content Services. We are the market leader in metadata, and we are building on our global leadership position with geographic expansion and new solutions beyond the core metadata business. 
In the U.S., Gracenote is now contracted with all of the top 10 MVPDs as measured by subscribers having acquired 2 additional providers earlier this year. In our top European markets, our market share is just under 20%, which provides a strong runway for growth because the remainder of the market is highly fragmented internal or point solutions. 
We've continued to win new business, and we are poised to accelerate our market share as we migrate new clients in 2022, extend into incremental geographies and increase our customer coverage in the markets in which we already operate. The U.S. and Europe are our largest markets, but we also have particular strength in Australia, Brazil and Mexico and several other big markets are in development. 
Ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we published the Gracenote Virtual Medal Table, forecasting which countries will take home metals enabling clients to deliver Olympics-focused stories across digital and broadcast properties. 
On client wins, we renewed our relationship with LG, adding services to help them expand their global service coverage and enhance the quality of their service. We are focused on the Gracenote ID becoming the universal solution for discovering content. And as content spend continues to grow, this creates opportunities to help content distributors better represent their programs in search and better understand and manage their catalogs. The ultimate goal is for the Gracenote ID to serve as a unifier across all content, similar to a UPC code in the retail industry to help clients answer key questions around licensing and distribution. 
Let me sum up. I opened the call discussing the massive shift in audiences and its impact on all of our clients, which is creating opportunity for Nielsen. In Audience Measurement, we are solving for a critical need in the industry with the development of Nielsen ONE. In Outcomes & Content, we are helping clients to maximize their investments in advertising and drive their content strategies. 
As you may have seen, we recently unveiled our new brand identity, which reflects the ongoing transformation of our culture and redefined strategy. And you'll see us continue to sharpen the narrative around the core strengths that differentiate Nielsen in the marketplace. 
Our purpose is to power a better media future for all people. We're well positioned to do so as the information services market leader for the media ecosystem. I look forward to keeping you updated on our continued progress. 
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to review the financials."

Similar to the last 2 quarters, I'd like to provide a relevant backdrop to the strong Q3 results that I'm pleased to share with you today. First, my remarks today focus on our results as of the Connect sale",1386,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Similar to the last 2 quarters, I'd like to provide a relevant backdrop to the strong Q3 results that I'm pleased to share with you today. 
First, my remarks today focus on our results as of the Connect sale we completed earlier this year in March and the resulting $2.3 billion debt paydown took place at the beginning of 2020, which helps with the year-over-year comparisons. 
Second, I want to remind you of the strength of our business, with 80% contracted revenue headed into any given year, and that accreditation is not a requirement of our contracts. That being said, as David noted, regaining accreditation is a top priority. 
I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our third quarter revenue performance. Revenue for Q3 was $882 million, up 5.1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or up 6.6% organic, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan, the April sale of our Advanced Video Advertising business to Roku and the recent acquisition of TVTY in July. Reported revenue grew 5.5%, which includes an FX benefit of 40 basis points. Revenue growth accelerated in the U.S. and remained solid in international markets. 
Of note, this quarter represents a high watermark for Q3 revenue in spite of revenue loss as a part of business exits over the past year. The return of COVID-impacted revenue also contributed to stronger revenue growth.
Audience Measurement revenue of $637 million was up 3.7% constant currency and 4.4% organic. National and digital measurement products were areas of strength. And from a client perspective, we had high single-digit growth with national media clients and double-digit growth from digital-first clients. Local posted another quarter of positive growth, but coupled with a weak Q1, we still expect local to be roughly flat for the year. 
Outcomes & Content revenue of $245 million grew 8.9% constant currency with organic revenue up 12.5%. We continue to see some improving trends in short-cycle revenue and strong growth in our sports business. We also continue to drive solid growth in content. The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rates. As you can see, the growth trend continued to improve in the third quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $382 million, up 2.1% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 1.9% constant currency. Following strong margin expansion in the first half of the year, we reported adjusted EBITDA margins of 43.3% during the quarter, down 143 basis points reported or 139 basis points constant currency year-over-year. This contraction was in line with our expectations. 
As we have discussed in prior quarters, there are several factors impacting our margins in 2021 that explain our year-over-year margin expansion in the first half of the year and compression in the second half of the year. First, because our cost base is relatively fixed, revenue growth drives operating leverage. 
Second, in early 2020, we reduced temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs began to return in Q2, though at a lesser pace than initially expected with the prolonged pandemic. And while they continue to increase in Q3, they have not reached the levels we expect when the pandemic is fully behind us. So we expect these costs to continue to trend up in Q4 and into 2022. 
Third, we began to implement our restructuring or optimization plan in Q3 '20. As a result, we saw significant year-over-year benefit in first half margins but the third quarter margin did not see the same kind of benefit on a year-over-year basis, and we'll continue to see this play out in the fourth quarter due to the timing of the optimization initiatives that phased in during the second half of 2020. 
On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020.  Adjusted EPS was $0.45 in the third quarter, up from $0.42 in Q3 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization. 
Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis was 22% in the quarter. This included $8 million in discrete benefits primarily related to audit settlements and state funds. When we adjust for this, our normalized third quarter effective tax rate was approximately 27%, which is in line with the normalized effective tax rate on a year-to-date basis. 
Our year-to-date free cash flow is $514 million as compared to $383 million in the prior year period. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA and lower interest payments. These improvements were partially offset by higher tax payments.
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Today, we are increasing elements of our full year guidance to reflect our solid Q3 results and our confidence in the balance of the year. We are raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and raising the low end of our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges. Let me take you through each of these. 
For revenue, we are raising the range to 4.5% to 4.75% for organic growth and to 3% to 3.25% for constant currency growth. This is above the guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5% organic revenue growth for the year that we communicated back in February, demonstrating our ability to successfully manage through the COVID recovery. 
Our updated guidance reflects the year-to-date strength and growth outlook for the fourth quarter, which faces a tougher comparison versus Q3 as COVID pressures on revenue began to subside in the fourth quarter of 2020. We remain optimistic about driving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth next year and beyond, in line with our medium-term targets. 
For adjusted EBITDA, we are now guiding $1.480 billion to $1.490 billion and maintaining our margin outlook of 42.3% to 42.6%. This compares to 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 42% as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. Our 2021 EBITDA guidance reflects the benefit of the optimization plan, underlying efficiency of the business and improved cost discipline, partially offset the return of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year and incremental investments and initiatives to drive growth over time. 
I'd remind you that COVID temporary costs have been coming back at a slower pace than initially expected, and we have been using some of that favorability to invest in the business this year, including investing in our panel and in growth initiatives. When we consider the dynamics that will lead to fourth quarter margin compression, they are similar to those impacting the third quarter and include the return of COVID temporary costs, growth investment and less of a year-over-year benefit from the optimization plan began in July of 2020. 
We are raising and tightening our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.65 to $1.70 versus a comparable $1.45 in 2020. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the tighter adjusted EBITDA guidance range and lower depreciation and amortization. And finally, we are raising the low end of our free cash flow guidance by $10 million to a range of $630 million to $650 million on solid year-to-date performance. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen bears under the Connect sale agreement.  We now expect approximately $200 million of full year versus our prior forecast of $200 million to $220 million, with $179 million paid in the first 9 months of the year. The vast majority of these costs are included in discontinued operations, and this is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs. 
We've made terrific progress during the year, strengthening our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with 3.15x net debt leverage on a pro forma basis while on the path towards our medium-term target range of 3 to 3.5x. As we approach the target, we will be well positioned to think more broadly about deploying capital. 
To wrap up, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results, and we are confident in our ability to execute on our growth plan. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sara for Q&A."

One of the criticisms of Nielsen has always been that you -- to exaggerate the point, people say that you define the media industry terms based on the small household panel, which you extrapolate. But you do have access to a lot of big data that you then run through the panel. So my question is, can you talk a little bit more about how this setup compares with some of the other competitors out there in terms of the scope, the size, the availability, the access to that data that you have?"
422760,1684950097,2415758,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Certainly. Thank you for the question, Tim. So let me start with linear. The best big data there for television is return path data which, of course, we have from our partnerships with the satellite folks and good cable on the local side. And on the audio",515,"Certainly. Thank you for the question, Tim. So let me start with linear. The best big data there for television is return path data which, of course, we have from our partnerships with the satellite folks and good cable on the local side. And on the audio side, then I'm from connected cars, which is something we're in discussion with the auto manufacturers on. It's the same RPD data for other models. 
So I think the difference between our approach and others who use RPD data is that we then validate that data with the panel because there are errors in it. There are places where the set-top box might be on and the TV is off. There are certainly no ability to append that back to actual people. We've had a statistical panel to put people on the overlay. So I would say we add to it with the panel. I think we make it better as a result than just using it in a raw form. 
In the streaming side, it's important to have ACR data. And I would say streaming is important, even -- the streaming approach and the ACR focus is even important for linear today. Keep in mind that 4 out of 10 households no longer have a cable subscription. 
So by definition, there's no set-top box. So you've got to get that through signals, audio signals that come off the TV. And we're unique in pulling that together. And then if it goes through a streaming platform like Roku, of course, with that deal announced earlier this year, we have added value there. 
There are other players who also use ACR data, a lot of that IP came from Gracenote. We certainly have real leadership in the technology. And I think we do it exceptionally well. And again, we can validate all that with empirical evidence from the panel. 
So last -- that's a great question. So sorry to go long, but the last thing I'd want to say about being the only party that has empirical evidence with the panel, that is a proven technique throughout data science today. I came to Nielsen after a decade in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
A couple of relevant examples that might be useful to you. One is vaccines. So AI was used to get to a COVID vaccine much faster than ever before. Big data certainly helped, but it was really important to have empirical panel of clinical trials so that real people were tested and those models were improved. And it absolutely would have been a disaster without taking the time for empirical data. 
Similarly, AI has vastly improved weather forecasting. But when it's really important, like a hurricane, you still get empirical data by flying hurricane hunters into storms to take real-world evidence, and you still validate those models every day with weather balloons and satellites. 
So we can go on and on, but I would just say nobody has a big data advantage on us, and nobody has our advantage with empirical evidence to validate that data."

But to your point, things can always shift around a little bit from 1 quarter to another, but there's really not anything in particular that I would call out. If you just reflect on 2020 versus 2021, we do face tougher comparisons even in Q4 versus Q3, because COVID was most impactful to us in Q2 and Q3 of last year. 
More broadly, there is still uncertainty around the pandemic. And I would say that some global supply chain challenges are out there, and that starts to raise questions about how this might impact short-term spending in the balance of the year. It could be a favorable or it could be an unfavorable. But with the pandemic still looming, we are just being very smart about the way that we're setting our guidance, again, full year guidance, but as you backed into the fourth quarter. 
I would say too, that overall, we've been pleased with our renewals this year, and it's for that reason that we do still feel optimistic about our medium-term guide on mid-single-digit organic revenue. 
So I would say, overall, biggest factor is definitely the tougher comparison and the varying of what's in Q3 versus Q4, always a little bit of shifting. But overall, we feel very good about the outlook."

On the first question of the ecosystem itself, as every part of being a currency is to actually facilitate between buyers and sellers. So there's a lot of ecosystem players that play a very important role. And so our data obviously fuels these buying and selling systems so that it can operate in effective pure in-house contest between buyers and sellers. 
So we're very close to all of these players because there is a good interdependency and that actually makes things easier and more fluid for the industry to operate efficiently. So that's the role that the 2 players play and we're embedded with many of them. And we called out a couple, obviously, but that becomes particularly important even as we transform all of our products because all of these ecosystem players then need to revamp how they use our data in the role that they perform for the industry. 
On the second question, yes, I think part of David called out as well as the feedback that we have taken to heart is being much more explicit in our communication of what we're actually doing. Panel, again, we don't want to dominate all the conversation about our innovation in just with panels. That panels continue to be important. We will communicate more broadly with our clients and the industry around the progress we're making, especially around getting reaccredited, panel sizes themselves have a role to play in the reaccreditation process.

I'll just reinforce, the transformation of the product is fairly broad and began pretty much beginning of this year with transforming our digital product to use an actual identity backbone that we built in 2022. So that, sort of think of that as a first step to building all of digital measurement, which will also affect anything delivered over IP. So that entire body of work has gone really well, it continues to go well. 
I'd say the next big thing is increasing our coverage, and you've seen a whole lot of announcements around our expansion to measure connected TVs. David called out a few metrics, but that program continues to go really well. Our capability is now -- help us cover pretty much 75% of CTV that's out there, and we will continue to expand that. 
Then comes the actual work on the traditional rating, which is what we would call linear broadcast. And the big move there is incorporating big data to drive obviously much more breadth, depth, granularity by also leveraging the panels there. So that is on track. January '22 is when we start to put that out there in the marketplace at scale for the market to start to play around with it and get a feel for it. It will have a pretty much a year of prior-year data so that people can use and learn from the change in the obvious methodology and the scale of the product. 
And then continuing to expand the rollout of meters through the panel. Like we've said, the panel is an important component to make sure the meters capture things sub minutes, which is important ultimately to the vision of driving de-duplicated cross-media currency, which by putting it all together is our time line for end of 2022. 
So everything is progressing like we have wanted. And I'll just also go out and say we're looking at every opportunity to accelerate because that's what clients are asking us for. But we feel very optimistic and are excited not just by the progress we've made, but also the milestones that we will hit as we have so far in the last 18 months. Thank you."

So a little bit like revenue, there are a lot of moving parts on margin as well. And maybe I'll just kind of take you back to last year. First, on revenue, we had the most pronounced COVID loss in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. And those declines started to lessen as we moved into Q4 last year. 
And then to your point, we did take actions early in 2020 and really protect our margins at that time. And we cut a lot of temporary costs and that had a range of different underlying levers as you referenced from executive salaries to 401(k) contributions. We had furloughs. And of course, G&E, as every company that's been faced by this pandemic had. 
And so that was about $100 million of temporary costs. And those costs started to come back in early 2021, but they've come back at a slower pace. And that has given us some flexibility to continue to invest in the business. And it gave us the flexibility to invest in both growth initiatives and our panel restoration activities. 
So we felt really, really good about the additional flexibility that, that gave us. But we do expect those costs to continue to return, the temporary costs into Q4. And if I just use T&E as a directional example, we're pretty much seeing those costs -- they're at a very low level, record low level, but we're pretty much seeing those costs double each quarter. And so I think that's probably a pretty good indication of how slowly but surely, we are recovering from this pandemic. 
The other thing that I think is important to mention, Greg, is optimization plan that we implemented last year. And again, as I referenced earlier, we implemented that plan really to protect our margins last year. And we've got the margins laid out in our deck on Page 8. But if you actually saw the Q2 '20 margins, they were considerably lower at 40.8%. 
And so when we implemented that plan, it gave us a really nice lift on the margin in the balance of 2020. But most of the initiatives played out in the second half of 2020, and they were phased in. And so we'll -- we saw the most benefit that optimization plan in Q4 last year. And of course, in the second half year, we're lapping that program. 
We are continuing to make investments and feel good overall about where things stand. But as a result of all of this, we do anticipate that the margin compression will be greater in Q4 than in Q3. 
I would note that we raised the low end of our 2021 EBITDA guidance, and we maintained our full year margin forecast, which is the 42.3% to the 42.6% but as a point of reference, that compares to a pro forma margin of 42% in 2020. So still very strong margins overall."

So we are very confident in the product strategy and the role the panel and its components play in that. But what we're working on immediately is just to get the remediation plan executed, which was sort of called out as the cause for the accreditation challenges we've had.

And there's nothing else out there in the marketplace that provides that level of breadth, accuracy and granularity. So there is many components to this. But right now, what we're focused on is the overall product strategy to get the Nielsen ONE. 
Back to you, David."

There are a number of folks I respect there, starting with their CEO, who I consider a friend. And quite honestly, I think their research people are really solid, and we learn from each other. So I want to start with that. 
And bringing together everybody across optimization, analytics and measurement is a good thing. So yes, we were glad to participate in that process and actually get called out specifically as being an important player to help with the evolution. So I want to say there's good intent. 
Beyond that, though, what I would say is where I started today's remarks with the change in industry, it's dramatic. I mean the fact that over 5 years, 1/3 of the total time spent on linear has gone away. The fact that we now have 4 out of 10 households no longer having a cable subscription, that fundamentally means no matter what I do, the ratings for the cable channels are close to 0 on the linear side. And it causes everyone to compete for the other half, which is dominantly streaming. That's going to change measurement. That's going to cause people to really want to step up and explain those answers. 
And I would say as their transition points, like the introduction of cable channels, then the introduction of the VCR, the early growth -- not only streaming but digital broadly, there's always noise about the measurement until people settle down. So I do think there is some noise now. And I think there are some constructive criticisms around COVID that we're taking seriously and improving. 
But I also think the noise will die down as things settle into a new state. And that state is going to be predominantly driven by streaming for most content. I think live events continue to have a role in broadcast. And so you end up with a live event world dominated by sports and an entertainment world driven by streaming. We're going to measure both. We're going to make them comparable. And as we do that, we're going to serve the industry and people will move on."

So maybe it's the timing of those factors. But does Nielsen ONE rollout also play into it? Is there incremental COVID recovery? If you could just help me bridge the categories. 
And then if I could squeeze in a second. You are fast approaching essentially there on your leverage target. In the prepared remarks, you said that as you approach that, you can think more broadly about deploying capital. How does the Board feel about a repurchase at this valuation? Or are you more talking about leaning in on M&A?"

Thanks for your questions, Jeff. And you kind of answered the first question because you ran a lot of the things that we're also seeing as we think about the revenue growth, clearly COVID, the impact year-over-year basis and seeing that revenue return. 
But it's not fully back to what we would have expected or would have hoped that it would be. Sports is a good example where things just aren't quite the way they were pre-COVID. And then as I referenced in my prepared remarks, we're seeing -- and in response to one of the questions, the whole supply chain situation bears some relevance in our outcome space with regard to what kind of spend we might see in the near term by our clients in that space. 
And David referenced as did I, how pleased we are with growth in national, and then our digital-first clients are also showing really strong growth. And I would point out too, that we're seeing growth around the world. We're certainly seeing strong growth, and it accelerated in the U.S. And we're seeing very solid growth in our international markets as well. 
On a reported basis, Jeff, I would just remind you that there were some businesses that we also exited as a part of our optimization plan. And so you still see that revenue on a reported basis in the prior year, and they were lower-growth businesses, generally speaking. 
And I think we're starting to see the benefit of our growth initiatives, and we feel good also about renewals that we've done during the course of the year. So it's a combination of all of those that cause us to feel really good about the outlook from a revenue perspective. 
With regards to leverage, we are so pleased to be approaching the high end of what we've guided as our medium-term range, having ended the quarter at 3.15x net debt. 
As far as deploying capital, we feel like we now have a range of options in front of us, but we're going to be very thoughtful about it. And we're definitely going to look at what can give us the highest return on our capital. We work hard to grow that capital, and we want to make sure that we're deploying it in a very smart way. 
And we are in the midst right now of our annual planning cycle. And we're in ongoing dialogue with the Board about ways in which to deploy that capital. We like investing in the business right now, and you've seen some of that play out during the course of the year. We will consider tuck-in M&A as we've described in the past. And then certainly, return of capital to shareholders is an option. And it's just really nice to be having the level of flexibility where we can start thinking in earnest about that range of options, and we're very excited about that."

422760,1684950097,2415758,"Nielsen Holdings plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Nielsen Holdings plc","Executives","Great.

So to be clear, there are clients we're engaging with today, agencies, digital platforms, advertisers and, of course, publishers and networks because this affects everybody. So we are certainly getting feedback today, not just on the estimates which we produce, but also improving the workflow. And as Karthik talked about earlier, the ecosystem really matters because we're -- Nielsen is so uniquely and deeply embedded into the transactional systems, the invoicing containment systems, if you will, that -- and reconciliation that we need to make sure that all evolves with us. And so that's happening. 
And we will continue to hit key milestones on big data. So some of that we're sharing right now. We started with the MRC, and we shared it with clients so they can see as big data is in the national measurement, what that looks like and how it feels more stable and robust. 
So we'll continue to share it. It will continue to be iterative. And this is why earlier, we talked to you about 24. We hope to have everything -- I would say we really plan to have everything operational by Q4 of next year. It will come throughout the year. And once that happens, then people will be able to use it and they'll also have the legacy system to compare so that they can manage. But our hope is to move everything to the new system and not maintain an old and a new version as of next year. 
I'd say the other thing that we're engaging with the industry on is getting everybody to a common data set. That actually will help. That was a big lift for the local market to make sure that we could add all the broadband-only homes in there. Those are homes that have neither a cable subscription nor an antenna. So it's not producing a lot of local volume, but it needed to be there to be able to measure everything off the same system and quite honestly, in order to move to impressions for local. 
So we're getting there across the board. And I think that announcement was indicative of where we'll be in the future. When we announced, we had 2 of the big station owners and 2 of the big agencies endorse it. And we're going to continue to work that way, more arm-in-arm with the industry in the rollout of Nielsen ONE throughout next year. So that's part one. 
In terms of the mix, I'll remind you where we were at Investor Day, and it hasn't changed much and that 49% of our revenue was from global media companies, and that includes the digital pure plays; another, I guess, 26% was from the local players, audio and video. So that would add up to about 3/4 of the revenue coming from the supply side or the publisher side. However, and I think this is important for people to remember, that's the revenue, but that's not the leverage in the system. 
To be clear, advertisers decide what currency they want to transact on. You've seen people put out press releases that they've got some new measurement system that you can now use. That can be done. But what really matters is what measurement system the buyer chooses to use. 
So I would say our focus as a company is focused on adding value to the industry with the best measurement. And the advertisers and agencies have an enormous role in our economics because they're the ones who are demanding the currency that best serves their purposes and quite honestly, the currency that best gives them the answer they need. So we have to continue to work with both sides on an equal basis. 
Thanks for the question, Matt. Very insightful."

Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate Nielsen's continued strategic and operational transformation in an evolving global media ecosystem.

Our second quarter results demonstrate Nielsen's continued strategic and operational transformation in an evolving global media ecosystem. These results also show that we are executing as planned on the growth strategy we laid out at our Investor Day in December. 
Let me remind you of the 3 overarching messages and compelling opportunity for Nielsen. First, we are focused on driving new growth from new solutions across all of our end markets globally. Across the board, we are delivering on the key elements of our product road map. 
Second, our cultural transformation is progressing well. Our associates around the globe have rallied around a growth-driven mindset, and we're benefiting from their energy, enthusiasm and clarity of focus. This means focusing on accelerating revenue growth and advancing our product evolution to match the rapid changes in audience behavior and the media ecosystem. 
And third, we have a compelling and strengthening financial model with 80% recurring revenue, expanding margins and increasing free cash flow conversion. 
I'll provide a high-level look at our second quarter results before turning to the business highlights. I'll then hand the call over to Linda for a more detailed review of our results. 
We are building on our consistent track record of success, and we are pursuing opportunities to further improve. Year-over-year revenue grew 6.2% on an organic basis. We are seeing the benefit of a COVID recovery in some markets, although it remains uneven globally. Our teams are doing a great job serving clients around the world, even in markets that remain challenged. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margins of 43% expanded 256 basis points on solid revenue growth and strong cost discipline. Our adjusted EPS of $0.43 increased from $0.35 in the prior year. And free cash flow was $190 million, up from $86 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a comparable basis. Following strong first half performance and reflecting our confidence in the 2021 outlook, we are raising the low end of our ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and also raising our EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. 
Turning to the business. I'd like to start with a high-level discussion on the value we bring to the media industry. 
There is no question that audiences are changing how they consume media. And platforms, networks, studios, advertisers and agencies are all transforming to meet and drive these changes. In the second quarter alone, our clients were involved in big mergers, big product launches, a robust advertising upfront and global expansion. Nielsen's 3 essential solutions, Audience Measurement, Audience Outcomes and Gracenote Content Services, were used by our clients to make decisions and negotiate with a common fact base as they navigate a changing media industry. We are growing especially well with our largest global partners with a scalable, digital-first approach. And we are seeing our clients increasingly invest across these 3 essential solutions, which will accelerate our growth over time.  
Finally, I'd remind you that Nielsen's mission is to power a better media future for all people. And this includes our strong commitment to our ESG priorities and performance. In June, we released an interim responsibility update, which highlights the important work we have done around the 6 key areas of our ESG strategy. The Board and I firmly believe these efforts are essential to the overall success of our organization. 
Now let me share some specifics for each of our 3 solutions. Starting with Audience Measurement, which posted 4% year-over-year organic growth. 
We are making significant progress on the building blocks that are foundational to Nielsen ONE, our cross-media currency solution. Industry engagement is critical to the success of Nielsen ONE, and we are partnering closely with media buyers and sellers in its development. We've launched a series of cross-functional working committees and recently met with the Executive Steering Committee, which consists of senior industry leaders. We received good feedback on our progress against coverage, comparability and resiliency. 
Our work with the industry includes the ANA, the Association of National Advertisers; and the WFA, the World Federation of Advertisers. Nielsen ONE aligns with their objectives for a cross-media measurement solution that best addresses the needs of advertisers. We are also supporting the ANA's Alliance for Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing, or AIMM, to help their members measure their investments in Black, Hispanic and Asian-owned media. 
We continue to be encouraged by renewals and expanded scope with both multichannel and digital pure-play clients as well as advertisers and agencies. Clients are renewing with larger contracts as they add more services. These are largely multiyear commitments with annual price escalators. 
Q2 advertiser and agency growth examples would include the extension of our Digital Ad Ratings agreement with Toyota and Dentsu's expanded relationship to include streaming measurement. On the publisher side, 9 of the top 10 TV network groups are now using our streaming measurement solutions. And just this week, Google cited Nielsen metrics on their earnings call to demonstrate the incremental reach for advertisers on their platform.  We also recently partnered with DAZN, a global streaming sports platform, on an audience measurement tool ahead of the Italian football season. 
Our local video and audio business continues to strengthen. We recently renewed and expanded our agreement with Entravision, which includes a comprehensive suite of measurement services, including local TV ratings covering their 22-market footprint and Nielsen Audio for all radio stations in 14 markets. We also renewed a multiyear deal with iHeartMedia across all of their markets. 
Let me walk through some recent product milestones for Nielsen ONE using coverage, comparability and resiliency as a framework. 
Starting with coverage, which we are expanding significantly. The addition of Roku as a data provider brings the aggregate number of devices measured close to 100 million, in combination with DIRECTV, DISH and VIZIO. And we've doubled the number of connected TV partners over the past year to most recently include Samsung TV Plus. When combined with our existing coverage of major platforms, such Hulu, Amazon and YouTube, this will bring our big data coverage of video digital ad spend in the United States to approximately 90%.  
We continue to hit milestones on streaming measurement also. We are expanding our base of streaming meters with approximately 14,000 installed meters as of July and broadened our coverage to include the top 15 streaming platforms. Outside the U.S., our streaming meters are now live in 6 markets, and we will continue to add markets over the next several quarters. 
Next, comparability. In June, we launched The Gauge, a new monthly analytic tool that provides the industry with a simple view of time spent that is comparable across streaming, traditional cable, broadcast channels and gaming. We were, of course, pleased that Netflix's co-CEO, Reed Hastings, publicly acknowledged that Nielsen is uniquely positioned to help scorekeep in the dynamic media landscape and that Netflix used The Gauge to demonstrate their runway for growth in their Q2 earnings update. There is a lot of great work and progress behind the scenes on driving comparability across TV and digital. 
Deduplication is a critical component, and we have recently completed a key step in this area, developing a methodology for cross-device deduplication within households. Another key milestone this year will be the integration of big data sources into Nielsen's national television measurement calibrated by our panel. These integrations are on schedule, and we're on track to have impact data by year-end that clients can use during 2022 for analytic purposes. We are also on track towards sub-minute measurement in our television panel, which will be enabled by innovation in our watermark and signature technologies. The work to make our existing metered panel sub-minute capable is near completion and expected to roll out in Q4 of this year. 
And finally, we remain in active discussions with the MRC, ANA, WFA, clients and other industry organizations as we build towards evolving the currency. 
The last point is resiliency. As the privacy landscape continues to evolve, with third-party cookie deprecation being the most notable change, we have taken proactive steps that provide us with the flexibility to adapt, enabling us to understand the audience and audience demographics in a privacy-focused way. 
Earlier this week, we unveiled our cookieless approach for audience and outcomes measurement, eliminating our reliance on digital identifiers. This new approach is enabled by our Nielsen identity spine, which allows us to deduplicate across linear and digital platforms as a part of Nielsen ONE. A full, privacy-focused redesign has already been completed for the 2 largest digital platforms. And we continue to enhance coverage of the identity spine, recently adding new data partners such as Toluna, DDEX, FullContact, Cint and ID5, and this builds on existing data relationships with Newstar, Narrative, Throtle and TrueData. 
I want to reiterate that all of our big data sets are validated by our robust panel, which represents an important truth set and statistically representative view of the audience in the U.S. and in key markets around the world. 
As discussed on our first quarter call, during COVID, CDC and state guidelines prevented us from entering panelist homes either to sign up new panelists or maintaining existing homes, and this presented an operational challenge. I'm happy to say that we have now restored full maintenance protocols and have been improving panel size and quality every week during the second quarter. We are closely engaged with the MRC, and they are up to speed on our progress. We remain committed to the MRC audit and accreditation process. 
Turning to Outcomes & Content, which grew 12.6% year-over-year on an organic basis in Q2. Audience Outcomes growth is driven by geographic expansion, expanding to new verticals beyond CPG and helping media companies better sell on the outcomes they deliver. 
Let me start with geographic expansion. We are expanding the global reach of our campaign outcomes measurement tool with the addition of Vietnam, India, Portugal, the Philippines and Switzerland, among others. We expect to be in over 40 markets by the end of the year. And earlier this month, we acquired TVTY, a leading TV attribution provider based in France, which expands our capabilities and data partnerships in Europe as well as the U.S. This tuck-in acquisition aligns with our strategy to deliver cross-media outcomes as a complement to Audience Measurement. 
In terms of new verticals and capabilities, we are seeing continued traction, growing our client base across a broad range of industries. We have an impressive roster of new wins in the U.S. and around the world, including industry giants such as Samsung, Microsoft and Anheuser-Busch. We recently expanded our capabilities in the important automotive vertical through a new partnership with IHS Markit to integrate their Polk Automotive data. Initially available for addressable audience activation, we'll expand the use cases across audience and outcomes measurement solutions over the next year. 
We have expanded our norms database designed to establish syndicated standards for campaign outcomes measurement across platforms which we launched last fall to now include nondurable retail and pharma in the U.S. 
Finally, we have made significant progress with many of our media publishers, adding outcomes metrics on top of Audience Measurement as they evolve the way they sell advertising. A timely example this week during the Tokyo Olympics. Our outcomes and Sports teams jointly worked with the International Olympic Committee to create a new solution measuring the return on sponsorship investment for some of the IOC's top partners. This is a first in the sports market and is a good example of expanding outcomes into sponsorships. 
We are evolving our core Multi-Touch Attribution product from digital exclusive to digital first with the addition of linear television and over the top. And we are expanding our channel coverage, which helps pinpoint the optimal spend across the entire media mix, now including the coverage of radio, print and social influencers. 
And finally, turning to Gracenote Content Services, which is also growing through geographic expansion and additional solutions beyond the core metadata business. 
We continue to see a very high renewal rate of Gracenote services. For example, we recently renewed our multiyear agreement with Verizon with a focus around streaming video services. During the second quarter, we expanded Gracenote with major clients into the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and most recently, Poland. 
We are also developing new solutions to add more value off the Gracenote platform. Earlier this year, we launched Inclusion Analytics, empowering smarter decision-making around inclusive content investments and helping to drive toward a more diverse and equitable future. And we've seen on interest for this service across media, agency and advertiser clients. We also recently signed long-term deals with 2 connected TV manufacturers to use Gracenote ID as a part of their advanced advertising platforms. 
Let me sum up. We reported another strong quarter due to solid execution and a cultural shift to a growth mindset. We are making continued progress on our product road map, and we are driving growth across our 3 essential solutions. We are adding new clients and new markets while also bringing more services and incremental value to our existing clients. We have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook, which is reflected in our updated guidance provided today. 
Let me now turn the call over to Linda to review the financials."

This appro",1312,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, my remarks today focus on our results as if the Connect sale and related $2.3 billion debt paydown that we completed earlier in the year took place at the beginning of 2020. This approach helps with prior year comparisons and is consistent with how we handled Investor Day in December and our 2021 guidance. You'll find comparable prior period comparisons in the appendix of today's slide presentation. 
Before I get into the results, I would just like to remind you that a year ago this time, we faced our most impacted quarter from a COVID perspective, and we had recently announced our large-scale optimization plan. All of this is a relevant backdrop to these strong Q2 results I am pleased to now review with you. I'll start with Slide 7, which summarizes our second quarter revenue performance.  
Revenue for Q2 was $861 million, up 4.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or up 6.2% organic constant currency, which adjusts for exits related to the 2020 optimization plan and the sale of our Advanced Video Advertising business to Roku earlier this year. On a reported basis, revenue grew 6.2%, which includes an FX benefit of 170 basis points. Revenue growth accelerated in both the U.S. and in international markets. 
We're continuing to see recovery from COVID-related pressures and strong execution by our teams around the world despite an uneven global recovery. For some perspective, despite the loss in the current year of revenue associated with business exits that were part of the 2020 optimization plan, Q2 '21 revenue was higher than Q2 '19 revenue. The same was true for the first quarter, and we believe surpassing pre-pandemic revenue levels demonstrates that we are driving fundamental growth in addition to recovering from COVID impacts in 2020. Our solutions are resonating with clients across our end markets around the world.
Audience Measurement grew 3.3% constant currency and 4% on an organic base. Growth remains solid across the board and especially strong in digital measurement. As expected, pressure in our local business has subsided with local posting positive growth for the first time in 10 quarters. As we discussed previously, our local business was down in the mid-single digits during the last 2 years due to pressure on multiyear contract renewals as we went through our local transformation. And that work was completed in late 2019. We cycled through those contracts and expect local to be roughly flat for the year.
Outcomes & Content grew 7.9% constant currency with organic revenue up 12.6%. We saw improving trends in short-cycle revenue and strong growth in our Sports business, both of which were hard hit in Q2 '20 due to COVID. We also continued to drive solid growth in Content. The right side of the page shows revenue for the past 5 quarters as well as constant currency and organic revenue growth rates. As you can see, the growth trend continued to improve nicely in the second quarter.
Turning now to Slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million, up 11.8% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 43% expanded 216 basis points reported or 256 basis points constant currency. On the right side of the page, we show adjusted EBITDA and margins over the last 5 quarters as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. 
There are several drivers to our margins. First, operating leverage from top line growth was strong. Second, we took swift actions in late Q1 '20 and reduced temporary costs by approximately $100 million. These temporary costs began to return in Q2 '21, though at a lesser pace than initially expected but will continue to ramp as the year progresses. And third, just over a year ago, we did a restructuring or optimization plan. So the incremental year-over-year benefit of this plan is more pronounced in the first half of this year versus the second half. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.43 in the second quarter as compared to $0.35 in Q2 '20. This was driven by higher EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization, offset in part by higher taxes. 
Our effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter. This includes $2 million in discrete items, which we add back for adjusted net income, resulting in a normalized second quarter tax rate of approximately 27.4%. 
Free cash flow was really strong at $190 million, which compares to $86 million in Q2 '20 on a pro forma basis. Key drivers of the year-over-year improvement include higher EBITDA, improved working capital, in part due to strong collections, and lower interest payments. These improvements were partially offset by higher tax payments, which is timing related within 2021.
And now I'll discuss our updated 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Today, we are increasing our full year guidance to reflect our solid Q2 results and our confidence in the balance of the year. We are raising the low end of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges and raising our margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance. Let me take you through each of these items. 
For revenue, we narrowed the range, and we are now guiding 4% to 4.5% organic constant currency growth. We've similarly raised the low end of the range for constant currency revenue growth, where we are now guiding 2.5% to 3%. 
For adjusted EBITDA, we are now $1.475 billion to $1.490 billion, with margins of 42.3% to 42.6%. This compares to 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of 42% as if the sale of Connect took place at the beginning of 2020. As we discussed last quarter, our 2021 EBITDA guidance reflects an approximately $60 million benefit of the optimization plan this year and the underlying efficiency of the business, partially offset by the return of COVID temporary cost cuts made last year as well as incremental growth investments. The return of temporary costs is more heavily weighted in the balance of the year. We also began to implement the optimization plan in Q3 '20. As a result, the second half faces a more challenging comparison, and we continue to forecast margin compression in the second half of the year. 
We are raising and tightening our adjusted EPS guidance to $1.54 to $1.61 versus a comparable $1.45 in 2020. This higher adjusted EPS range is driven by the tighter adjusted EBITDA guidance range and lower depreciation and amortization, which is offset in part by a slightly higher share count. 
And finally, we are raising and tightening our free cash flow guidance to a range of $620 million to $650 million on solid EBITDA performance, lower interest payments and strong collections. 
As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges do not include the impact of onetime separation-related costs, which Nielsen has absorbed under the Connect sale agreement. Today, we are lowering our expectation for these cash costs by $20 million and now expect a range of $200 million to $220 million for the full year with $164 million paid in the first half of the year. The vast majority of these costs are included in discontinued operations, and this is the last year of any meaningful separation-related cash costs.
We ended Q2 with 3.62x net debt leverage on a pro forma basis, well on our path towards our medium-term net debt leverage target of 3 to 3.5x. Given this progress, we are lowering our year-end leverage guidance range to 3.5 to 3.7x.
To wrap up, we are pleased with our second quarter results. The strength of key underlying drivers reinforces the confidence that we have in our ability to execute on Nielsen's growth story and deliver our full year guidance and longer-term goals.
And now I'll turn the call back to Sara for the Q&A session."

Nielsen ONE is foundationally about cross-media measurements and the 3 biggest components of which are obviously coverage, resiliency and comparability. Those are the sort of 3 core pillars that get us ultimately to what we are going to deliver in 2022. 
And as a reminder, we launched all of our digital solutions already under a completely new backbone that is completely resilient for all the changes in the privacy environment. That was an important component. The identity spine that powers that is another component of that.
And going into the second half of the year, it's a little bit more focused on expanding coverage, which is all of the CTV coverage expansions that we're launching with all the players. David called them out. So those are important. They'll start to launch in Q3. 
And going into the rest of the year is all of the work we're doing around granularity and addressable, which is the -- which is emboldened by the launch of our analytic capability where we're putting out the national capability -- the national linear capability with big data. So you can imagine all of the flexibility and granularity that starts to add and ultimately pushes us into next year where there's a whole host of other things, including the deduplication methodology, which is ultimately the core of where all this comes together, deduplicating across every component of media delivery that takes place. So that's what we're building towards. The road map is completely on track from all of the inputs as well as what clients start to see periodically going into the rest of the year and into early next year."

So when David talked about all of the integrations we have, it's about enabling an interoperable world where identity is obviously a big challenge. 
So it is a team sport, but the version that we're building and have continued to build is largely around use cases of measurement. And use cases of measurement is foundationally -- you can think about it as deduplicating where many different versions of exposure are difficult when you have to put them together into deduplicated reach of frequency. That's the use case that we're solving for primarily. And so interoperability and deduplication, that's what we're about, and that makes us a little bit different than the other solutions. But we're making really good progress on that."

And that's the reason we went ahead with our launch and our cookieless solutions for measurement and for attribution.
What I would say on the 50%, that really -- has more to do with which of the publishers have already been solved for. So we obviously started with the biggest ones, and they're there. We now have this solution. And in our release, we talked about the solution for the unauthenticated. For those who are smaller, who may not have as much first-party data, we're getting there with some added techniques that use the probabilistic models and machine learning.

On the first part, I'm going to let Karthik go into the details on COVID recovery. We had to do some things differently during COVID. And of course, COVID is not done. But we did get to the point where it was safe to be back in homes, both for recruiting and replacement. And we're operating at a very strong pace, and we've actually increased investment to make sure that we have the panels the way it needs to be. 
It's a fair complaint that people would want that instantly. So I don't love the tactics, but I would agree that it is important that we resolve the panel. The -- and I'm going to let Karthik describe how. 
The second part of that though, to be clear, the accreditation is very important. We think it really builds trust in the industry. But it's a vote of confidence. It's not required to use the product, and it's not in our contract. So we're not required to maintain accreditation. We certainly have it as a goal.

So our plan is completely on track in terms of all the corrections we needed to make coming out of COVID. Even though COVID is not over, we've managed to get back into field basically completely, going and checking for all of the homes in calls and flags that we were unable to do during the peak of COVID. So our execution there to get the panel back up to where it needs to be is completely on track. 
And yes, as David said, we don't love getting the added push. But look, like we work with clients as well to showcase and tell them exactly what we're doing.

And I think that's a really nice validation. 
And of course, as I said, those digital-first players are driving a lot of our growth in this post-COVID period and will continue to drive our growth given the nature of the relationship. So I feel really good about that.
More broadly, I would say, on the demand side, the people who buy advertising, the people who invest in content, I think there's a lot more credibility that Nielsen really does measure the total audience. I think there was a narrative when I got here that maybe we were more broadcast than linear focused. And I think it's really clear we're audience focused, and we're following the audience wherever she goes and is going to streaming in a lot of ways in a lot of categories. 
So listen, it's early days, but I think this is the kind of validation leading up to Nielsen ONE and leading us to moving the whole market towards an integrated view of the total audience across both streaming and linear on the same basis. And already, it's being used for decisions and for folks to manage their product strategies."

As we think about the second half of the year, we do still continue to expect solid revenue growth. 
I will point out that the first half of the year was a bit stronger than our expectations, and you see that in the guidance revisions that we've provided today. 
The subscription portion of our business, which is about 80% of the total, doesn't have as much variability because we've got a lot of visibility into that business. But on the outcome side of the business, there's definitely more variability, and we saw that last year and now this year with the impact of COVID. We're benefiting though from an improving ad market from a COVID recovery perspective, and we're optimistic. But we're of the opinion that this pandemic is not behind us and it's an unpredictable environment. So we've incorporated a bit of risk at the low end around the speed or the pace of the global recovery.
You heard earlier from Karthik and David that we're doing well on our product road map, and execution on that is important for the second half. We do have our initiatives and growth investments that we're making, which are more second half weighted, and some of those will take a little bit of time to ramp.

But I think we're getting much more agile at managing that. I'm really proud of the teams for doing that. 
We -- I think we already covered the Nielsen ONE road map, which, of course, is super important. That's a heavy subscription business. I'd like to have Karthik spend a minute on some of the product innovations that are coming in Content and outcomes because those are, as you saw, driving even more growth. And we're really excited about all 3 legs of the Nielsen revenue fuel. Karthik?"

Again, just going out to the strategy, 3 components there. One is vertical expansion. I think you've heard us talk multiple times about going outside of consumer packaged goods because that's where 90% of marketing dollars get spent, or ad dollars anyway. So expanding coverage. You saw what we're doing in the automotive space. You saw mentions about retail, nondurable retail and pharma. That trading will continue to expand. 
Then it's about making it even more relevant to both sides of the coin, not just the buyers but also the sellers so that sellers can really tell the story of their inventory not just from a volume perspective, which is reach, but also from a value perspective, which is outcomes. And so everything we've mentioned there about how we're being used, our outcome capabilities are being used and will continue to be used by sellers as well is an important component.
And then global expansion is a really important component because, again, everything we're doing in outcomes is about telling the story about the value of marketing, and that's relevant everywhere almost the same way. And so expanding into more markets going again into 2022.
And on the Gracenote side, just -- it's about a couple of things. One is the world of discovery is even more exciting just given the proliferation of platforms and the new innovations in which content is being delivered to consumers. So it's a combination of market expansion as well as capability expansion such as advanced discovery. 
And then the ultimate angle there for us is the expanded use of the Gracenote ID. Because in a world where content is proliferating to so many platforms, the Gracenote ID becomes a unifier to figure out exactly where that content is going and how it's being licensed. Is it being used the way it was -- is the content being used the way it was expected to? So there's a whole bunch of components there that are very exciting for us, many of those in the second half as well as going into 2022."

So you raised a place where I -- I think we're always going to continue to innovate and improve on the tech backbone and take advantage of the latest technologies because I think that is important. And technology as a science continues to evolve. 
What I will say is the foundation is there. The work that needed to be done from when I first got here until now to get us on a single platform to be able to be cloud-based, which really means that more of your software can be composable, the ability to get things done in days and weeks, not months and years, is -- it gets better every day. So I think it's a very solid foundation.
I think the fact that it is a single platform makes it much easier to continue to innovate on. But it's going to be a never-ending process to make sure that Nielsen is at the front edge of the technology curve going forward. 
Flip side is, I would say that's really helping us with talent because people are finding that they can do really leading-edge things here, and they're pretty excited about that. So as we've been bringing new people in this year, this has been a really interesting job. They love our CTO, they love the tech team and they love the project."

So we're going to continue to invest, we're going to continue to improve and we're going to continue to be transparent so that everyone can have confidence and trust in the fidelity of what we're producing.
That said, what I would also say is this changing market that we're trying to measure with Nielsen ONE is more sophisticated. It has a combination of ACR data, which is why it feels like Roku were so important, why the CTV integrations are so important and that the -- you need that for streaming. There's still a lot of cable data, and there's an increasing number of homes that are broadband only. So us making sure we're measuring all of it is key. And I think it's certainly telling the market that the Nielsen ONE solution is going to be needed and needed as quickly as we can get it out there.
So yes, I do think it creates demand as people acknowledge the changing market. And I think we need to continue to strengthen all aspects of our data, including our panel, and be transparent about that. Karthik, I don't know if you want to add anything."

And then a quick one for Linda. We couldn't help noticing that removing some of the ""other items"" from adjusted EBITDA, which is about $38 million this year versus $2 million last year, would have taken margins down quite a bit.

With regard to a breakdown on international versus domestic, we don't do that breakdown regularly. But if I use 2020 as a barometer, international exposure was about 17%. And I would remind you that Gracenote is a very global business. And so a meaningful portion of our international exposure is because of the global nature of that business. But we're very optimistic about international as a growth opportunity for us. 
So as we make our annual disclosures on the mix of domestic versus international, I would expect to see some proportion of that trend up, but it's on a much smaller base. So it will take time before you see that mix shift coming through in our numbers."
