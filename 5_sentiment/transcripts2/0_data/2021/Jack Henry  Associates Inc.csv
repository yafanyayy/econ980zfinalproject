277617,702444952,2200349,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commit",1362,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. We remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our HR teams continue to work closely with all groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and have now updated our return to office date to July 1. 
At this point, I don't anticipate us extending that date, although I definitely expect long-lasting changes to our in-office work model. Most of our customers now have many people physically in their locations everyday, and we regularly receive requests to deliver on-site sales engagements and system implementations. As I mentioned on the last call, our sales teams are routinely doing sales presentations and executing contracts with no on-site presence at the customer location. We have also completed many 100% remote implementations with great success, including several full core conversions. 
With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in December. For Q2 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $5.5 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts the current quarter negatively, but as we have highlighted in the past, is good news if you take a long-term view. 
Turning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 1% for the quarter and increased by 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 2% increase in revenue this quarter and a 3% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions business with a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 4% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams, again, had a very solid quarter as they booked the fifth largest sales quarter in the history of the company. We inked 6 competitive core takeaways and 12 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. On previous calls, I highlighted the fact that our competitive core signings have slowed a bit as a result of the pandemic and that was also true in Q2. With that in mind, you may ask how it was possible for us to book the fifth largest quarter in history with less than the new core win category. Of course, this happens because the sales teams have had tremendous success with our broad suite of complementary offerings, including digital, fraud and payment solutions. 
During the quarter, we signed 61 new clients to our Banno Digital Suite, 6 new clients on our treasury management platform and 11 new clients on our card processing solution. Of course, all of these contracts represent new revenue to Jack Henry. As I mentioned last quarter, we continued to implement more than 30 new financial institution clients every month on our Banno Digital platform. As of February 1, we now have more than 4 million users on the platform, but that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, our Banno platform has been recognized by EFI Navigator as having the highest consumer rating in the App store, and we are continuing to receive accolades as the fastest application in the industry. If you combine our inroads in the digital banking space, with our ongoing success with digital lending and digital account opening, we see great things ahead for Jack Henry as a leader in this area. Regarding our new card processing platform, as of the end of December, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our core clients and many of our noncore clients. We will complete all of the migrations next month as previously announced. You will start to see the larger positive impact on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter as we have emphasized throughout the project. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. 
Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that its Fed Now team has been working closely with a few companies over the past year to help them design and develop the Fed Now network. We have been very active with the Fed Now team for more than a year, and we're excited to participate in their pilot program. We look forward to bringing many financial institutions live through our payments hub,  which we have branded Jack Henry Pay Center. As I've discussed previously, our pay center solution was designed to provide connectivity through a single platform to multiple real-time payments providers, which facilitates a more logical and efficient approach for our clients than any other processor in the market today. Additionally, it allows us to connect clients to the real-time payments network in groups rather than one at a time, which is a significant enhancement over any other offering in the industry. 
In addition to working with the Fed on the FEDNOW program, many of you know that we have also been very involved in the rollout of the PPP program through the first 2 rounds last year and the latest round earlier this year. We are currently working with many of our financial institution clients to help submit and process thousands of PPP loans with their current pipeline totaling almost $1 billion in loans to small businesses around the country. Hopefully, many of you noticed that we released our first corporate sustainability report on December 31. Although I'm very proud of the report and its content, I think it's important to note that Jack Henry has practiced the concepts of corporate responsibility since our founding. This report is our way of summarizing the standards and practices we've been dedicated to for more than 40 years and which are evident every day as we strive in all cases to adhere to our guiding principle of doing the right thing. In the report, we discussed our commitments to our 5 key stakeholders: our employees, customers, stockholders, communities and the environment. Our investment in corporate responsibility is embodied through our commitment to: enabling our associates to engage in meaningful work that they love; providing innovative financial solutions to our customers to support responsible business decisions and keep their clients connected delivering a strong return on investment to our stockholders while maintaining long-term sustainability for our business model; encouraging our communities to flourish by connecting people with technology; and pursuing environmentally friendly practices to support a strong future for us all. In January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of their annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, 73% of banks in our target market expect to increase their technology spending as they rebound from the pandemic in 2021, with 22% of them indicating an increase of greater than 10% year-over-year. This correlates with the information we're receiving from other sources, which puts the average expected increase in tech spending for 2021 in our market at around 5%. I think that pent-up demand is reflected in the continued influx of RFPs we're receiving and the ongoing interest in Jack Henry Technology Solutions. 
As we begin the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."
277617,702444952,2200349,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter a",1414,"Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter and deconversion fees of $7.7 million revenue and divestitures of $1.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter, this revenue line would have grown 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year. Service and support revenue primary driver was data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud, which continues to show very strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year. However, the growth in that line was totally offset by a decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which is due to decreased license, hardware and imitation revenue for primarily on premise customers, pass through revenue, which is related to our billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations related to COVID; and our Jack Henry Annual Conference, or our JAC, which was held virtually, and therefore, no registration fees for customers or vendors for our tech fair. And then obviously, as mentioned, deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year, which is -- all those lines were a decrease. Processing revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage growth of all revenue lines in both Q2 and year-to-date this year compared to the same periods last year. Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter, as Dave mentioned, compared to last year on a GAAP basis and was up a little over 2% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of deconversion fees and revenue from divestitures. Our cost of revenue was up 3% compared to last year second quarter. This increase was due primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at December 31 compared to a year ago quarter. The increase in cost was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result, again, of COVID travel limitations. Our research and development expense decreased 1% for the quarter compared to last year. This decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of our overall costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily almost completely due to travel-related expense savings as a result of COVID-19, which required us to hold our JAC virtual this year as previously mentioned, and also due to the gain on disposal of assets in this quarter of this year. Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased slightly from 22.4% last year to 22.2%, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already discussed and our increased cost. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased from 21.1% last year to 21.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment margins continue to be impacted by the additional costs related to our card processing platform migration. As Dave mentioned -- as he discussed in his opening comments, our core segment operating margins increased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while complimentary segment margins decreased slightly on a GAAP basis but improved on a non-GAAP basis compared to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 23.1% this year compared to 23.2% last year. And our net income was $72 million for the second quarter compared to $72.1 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.94 in both quarters. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 4% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service in the past. Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $8.9 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $10.5 million last year. Our depreciation was up 5% year-to-date, primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed into service. We purchased 675,000 shares of Jack Henry stock year-to-date for $110 million, and we paid dividends of $65.5 million for a total return to shareholders of $175.5 million year-to-date. Our operating cash flow was $194 million for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which is down a little from $215 million last fiscal year. We invested $76.6 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. And our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, less CapEx and less cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was $163.8 million year-to-date. 
A couple of comments on our balance sheet as of December 31. Our cash position is still in very good shape at $147.8 million, down a little from $213 million at June 30. Due to the previous items discussed, there is nothing drawn on the revolver, which has a maximum capacity of $700 million. So we've got a lot of dry powder, and we had no other long-term dean balance sheet other than the capitalized operating leases. 
In the press release yesterday, we confirmed both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance yesterday, and they were basically guided as previously in line. However, just to be clear that this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if the country is forced to shut down again due to the pandemic or the economy stalls or actually reverses, then this guidance will be revised. Also, I'd like to emphasize that in our GAAP guidance that we continue to forecast revenue from deconversion fees for FY '21 will be down approximately $33 million from what we saw in FY '20. We have seen $14.6 million decrease in the first half of the year alone, and we will see a significant decrease in Q3 as that was the largest quarter for deconversion revenue last fiscal year and the largest increase year-over-year. We see little to no current M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which, in the short term, as Dave mentioned, will hurt revenue growth. But in the long term, as we have always said that we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue to the long term. 
This means based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we continue to look at a GAAP revenue growth of 3% to 4-plus percent. The adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY '21 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to the previous year and the small revenue impact from the cruise divestiture in Q2 it was removed from FY '20 for comparison to FY '21. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance has not changed from Q1, the difference of all deconversion fees and revenue from the divestiture. 
We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY '21 to be down just slightly at about 22% from last year for all the reasons previously mentioned, and our non-GAAP margins to actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 at around 22%. and with the significant headwinds created by the projected significant decrease in deconversion revenue in our third fiscal quarter we are guiding Q3 EPS to be $0.83 to $0.87, which I believe is generally in line with the current consensus. However, we have increased our full year EPS guidance for FY '21, which we provided last quarter to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.80, and we are now updating our EPS guidance for FY '21 to the range of $3.85 to $3.90, with no change to our projected impact decrease in deconversion fees. The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies. 
This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Jay, will you please open the call lines up for questions."

So first, there are some that are trying to figure out whether or not the neo banks are truly competitors or not. Oftentimes, the neo banks are attracting the customer who's looking for free. And our customers like any customer have trouble making money on free. So sometimes they're not terribly distressed if some of those customers leave to go to somebody like Chime. I think that explains why these neo banks aren't making any money. But that's the short-term view, and we take a long-term view, are they going to attract the customer and then build on that customer for the long term. So a lot of our customers are trying to figure out how to compete in that space. So many of them have launched digital-only banks, digital-only brands. And of course, we support that. We've talked about that on the call before. Where we're hosting a separate brand in our Jack Henry private cloud, a separate processing environment, separate marketing by the bank to make sure that they have an opportunity to attract those customers. The other approach that some banks are taking is trying to figure out how to partner more closely with fintechs, so not necessarily with a neo bank, but with other fintechs to enable the same type of we'll say, cool experience, make sure that they're providing that connectivity. And of course, as I've discussed many times on this call, Jack Henry is very supportive of that environment, where we provide the hooks, provide the connectivity for fintechs to connect into our infrastructure and help our banks achieve success that way. 
So it depends on the bank. You have some who maybe put their head in the sand a little bit. You have others who are being aggressive about launching digital-only banks. And then you have some that are working with fintechs to create a whole new experience in some other way. And it just depends on the profile of the bank and their feeling of the competitive nature of those players."

You're replacing the entire guts of your processing operation. And so in this environment, the pandemic environment, where everybody had people working from home, that type of decision and that type of disruptive move was a little bit challenging for a lot of CEOs to make that move. But they still wanted to offer innovative new technologies. They need to take care of the customers, particularly because all of their consumers were living and working from home and expected to have an outstanding digital experience so they needed to continue to implement these smaller point solutions, complementary solutions to augment the services that they provide for their consumers and that they provide internally to their employees. And so that's where we have this broad suite of complementary solutions, and I highlighted a few of them on the call today, that's where a lot of those things have really stepped up, particularly around digital. So there's digital banking, which we used to call online banking and mobile banking. There's digital lending. There's digital account origination. All those things have been hot commodities here lately because of that move to remote work."

There is pent-up demand. People just kind of put a stop on it, but they still need to upgrade their infrastructure. So we saw our fees start to pick up in the late fall. I'll say, I highlighted on the November call, and that's absolutely true today. 
So we are today, if you look at our sales pipeline today, it is as full as it was, we'll say, 18 months ago. So 18 months ago -- let me back up a second. We normally think in terms, as we run the business, the sales pipeline you want to be. You want to have about 90% of the annual quota for the company at any given day, the sales pipeline should be at about 90% of the full year's quota because some deals aren't going to happen, and some will happen and so on. And we're back to that level now. So we're almost about 90% of our annual quota is in the pipeline today. And that's the way I say we're -- the engine is running again where core demand has picked up, and that's part of the reason that I'm pretty optimistic about our opportunity for sales success going forward."

To get back to our operating model for banks and credit unions to be like it was 2 years ago. They'll have a remote workforce going forward, just like we will. So that is not the trigger. 
I think now it's them understanding how to run the business with a combination of in office and remote, and they recognize they need to do a technology upgrade. Okay, now let's get down to business and make that decision. And move forward with the technology upgrade. And then we can do conversion -- core conversions, 100% remote.

Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, a lot of strange things going on in our financials right now. Is there some potential upside for Q4? Absolutely. But when you look at Q3, I mean, some of the big savings we got were definitely travel-related because our people just aren't moving because of restrictions and different things. But that also impacts revenue. So as I made some open comments, I mean, license, hardware, implementation, billable travel is all down. And so when we do get to start traveling again, the travel expense will go up and we -- and our salespeople are starting to get out there and move a little bit, and some of our installs are moving a little bit more. So our travel cost is going to go up. Yes, some of that's billable, which also increased revenue. But remember that in our business, the revenue is all kind of delayed. So even though our travel expenses may go up and other costs go up, the revenue related to that travel is probably not going to happen for a quarter or more. So there's potential for some negative impact on margins in the short term, but it's going to drag along all that revenue. So I -- so you're absolutely right, there is some potential upside from our Q4. And once we get past this and into more of a regular cadence, I think we can go right back into that regular margin expansion that we've seen historically."

There's a ton of secondary questions you've asked there. But what to expect. The best guidance I can give you there is that the pipeline, the incoming pipeline as far as the deal volume that we're working today is back to the level that it was prepandemic. Now can I predict exactly when things will sign and close? That's -- it's more art than science when it comes to timing on those things. But if we assume that we'll win at the same rate that we're winning prepandemic, and we know that the pipeline is at about the same level as it was pre pandemic. Logically, we can assume, I think, that sometime later this calendar year, the rate of wins will be similar to what we were experiencing prepandemic. And then the thing to keep in mind is once we sign a new core deal, the revenue doesn't hit the P&L. The majority of the revenue doesn't hit the P&L, oftentimes for at least a year afterwards. And once we start a conversion, that conversion is a major impact to the financial institution, as I was highlighting earlier, some people call it rip and replace where you're taking everything out and replacing it with a brand-new system. Well, that takes many months of planning and operation to get that conversion completed. So the revenue -- the big chunk of revenue normally follows often times a year after we've signed the contract or announced a win."

But what I do expect, as we just talked about in the last question is more on the core signing side. I expect as we go forward that we'll start to see more on the core signing side. The thing that will be interesting to watch is, can we sustain the pace that we've seen on the complementary side because if we can increase core bookings and sustain the complementary bookings, that's significant. That's meaningful. I'm not ready to say that, that's achievable, but that will certainly be our objective. And I think we have the opportunity to do that because we're getting all of this great recognition for some of this wonderful technology that we've been rolling out here, particularly in the area of digital.

So the big thing, I mean, if you're going to go back 6 or 7 years, and you really can't go back that far because you can really only go back to 2017 because when we restated for ASC 606, that was the farthest back we went.

So you really can't look beyond that and get a true comparison of margins because ASC 606 definitely changed how we recognize revenue and had a significant impact on margins. 
But from '17 forward, the primary impact on our margins has been 2 things. One, the migration to the new card platform has increased our cost because we haven't been able to reduce any cost until we get through the migration. Which, as Dave said in his opening comments, is going to be complete at the end of March. So we will start to see that cost savings. We'll see a nice rebound in margins in Q4 and then a full year of that cost reduction in FY '22. The other thing that's happened since '17 is we have literally sold no new core business. So there's been virtually no new core license revenue, which is very high-margin business happening in the last 3 or 4 years. I mean, on the bank side, I think we have sold maybe 3 or 4 in-house deals since 2017. On the crediting side, not bearing any more than that. And most of those were smaller bank deals for our core director solution. So we -- so those are the 2 primary drivers as COGS that margin come down. Now what's going to happen is, like I said, you'll see margin improve in Q4. We'll continue to see it improve in the following year. We have gone through the transition of getting -- I mean, our license and hardware revenue is now very small percentage of our total revenue, so very little impact from that. So as we continue to migrate our -- in -- our on-prem customers to our private cloud and continue to sell additional card business and our private cloud business continues to become a much larger percentage of our total revenue, that's a very high-margin business. Our margins will continue to grow and get back to the historical rates in FY '23 and beyond."

277617,702444952,2200590,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commit",1356,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. 
We remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our HR teams continue to work closely with all groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and have now updated our return-to-office date to July 1. 
At this point, I don't anticipate us extending that date, although I definitely expect long-lasting changes to our in-office work model. Most of our customers now have many people physically in their locations every day, and we regularly receive requests to deliver on-site sales engagements and system implementations. As I mentioned on the last call, our sales teams are routinely doing sales presentations and executing contracts with no on-site presence at the customer location. We have also completed many 100% remote implementations with great success, including several full core conversions. 
With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in December. For Q2 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $5.5 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts the current quarter negatively, but as we have highlighted in the past, is good news if you take a long-term view. 
Turning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 1% for the quarter and increased by 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 2% increase in revenue this quarter and a 3% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions business with a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 4% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams, again, had a very solid quarter as they booked the fifth largest sales quarter in the history of the company. We inked 6 competitive core takeaways and 12 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. On previous calls, I highlighted the fact that our competitive core signings have slowed a bit as a result of the pandemic and that was also true in Q2. With that in mind, you may ask how it was possible for us to book the fifth largest quarter in history with less than the new core win category. Of course, this happens because the sales teams have had tremendous success with our broad suite of complementary offerings, including digital, fraud and payment solutions. 
During the quarter, we signed 61 new clients to our Banno Digital Suite, 6 new clients on our treasury management platform and 11 new clients on our Card Processing Solution. Of course, all of these contracts represent new revenue to Jack Henry. As I mentioned last quarter, we continued to implement more than 30 new financial institution clients every month on our Banno Digital platform. As of February 1, we now have more than 4 million users on the platform but that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, our Banno platform has been recognized by FI Navigator as having the highest consumer rating in the App store, and we are continuing to receive accolades as the fastest application in the industry. If you combine our inroads in the digital banking space, with our ongoing success with digital lending and digital account opening, we see great things ahead for Jack Henry as a leader in this area. 
Regarding our new card processing platform, as of the end of December, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our core clients and many of our non-core clients. We will complete all of the migrations next month as previously announced. You will start to see the larger positive impact on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter as we have emphasized throughout the project. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. 
Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that its FedNow team has been working closely with a few companies over the past year to help them design and develop the FedNow network. We have been very active with the FedNow team for more than a year, and we're excited to participate in their pilot program. We look forward to bringing many financial institutions live through our payments hub, which we have branded Jack Henry PayCenter. 
As I've discussed previously, our PayCenter solution was designed to provide connectivity through a single platform to multiple real-time payments providers, which facilitates a more logical and efficient approach for our clients than any other processor in the market today. Additionally, it allows us to connect clients to the real-time payments network in groups rather than one at a time, which is a significant enhancement over any other offering in the industry. 
In addition to working with the Fed on the FedNow program, many of you know that we have also been very involved in the rollout of the PPP program through the first 2 rounds last year and the latest round earlier this year. We are currently working with many of our financial institution clients to help submit and process thousands of PPP loans with their current pipeline totaling almost $1 billion in loans to small businesses around the country. 
Hopefully, many of you noticed that we released our first corporate sustainability report on December 31. Although I'm very proud of the report and its contents, I think it's important to note that Jack Henry has practiced the concepts of corporate responsibility since our founding. This report is our way of summarizing the standards and practices we've been dedicated to for more than 40 years and which are evident every day as we strive in all cases to adhere to our guiding principle of doing the right thing. In the report, we discussed our commitments to our 5 key stakeholders: our employees, customers, stockholders, communities and the environment. 
Our investment in corporate responsibility is embodied through our commitment to: enabling our associates to engage in meaningful work that they love; providing innovative financial solutions to our customers to support responsible business decisions and keep their clients connected, delivering a strong return on investment to our stockholders while maintaining long-term sustainability for our business model; encouraging our communities to flourish by connecting people with technology; and pursuing environmentally friendly practices to support a strong future for us all. 
In January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of their annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, 73% of banks in our target market expect to increase their technology spending as they rebound from the pandemic in 2021, with 22% of them indicating an increase of greater than 10% year-over-year. This correlates with the information we're receiving from other sources, which puts the average expected increase in tech spending for 2021 in our market at around 5%. I think that pent-up demand is reflected in the continued influx of RFPs we're receiving and the ongoing interest in Jack Henry technology solutions. 
As we begin the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."
277617,702444952,2200590,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter a",1415,"Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter and deconversion fees of $7.7 million revenue and divestitures of $1.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter, this revenue line would have grown 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year. 
Service and support revenue primary driver was data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud, which continues to show very strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year. However, the growth in that line was totally offset by a decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which is due to decreased license; hardware and imitation revenue for primarily on-premise customers; pass-through revenue, which is related to our billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations related to COVID; and our Jack Henry Annual Conference, or our JAC, which was held virtually, and therefore, no registration fees for customers or vendors for our tech fair. 
And then obviously, as mentioned, deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year, which is all those lines were a decrease. Processing revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. 
Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage growth of all revenue lines in both Q2 and year-to-date this year compared to the same periods last year. Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter, as Dave mentioned, compared to last year on a GAAP basis and was up a little over 2% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of deconversion fees and revenue from divestitures. Our cost of revenue was up 3% compared to last year second quarter. This increase was due -- primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at December 31 compared to a year ago quarter. The increase in cost was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result, again, of COVID travel limitations. 
Our research and development expense decreased 1% for the quarter compared to last year. This decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of our overall costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily almost completely due to travel-related expense savings as a result of COVID-19, which required us to hold our JAC virtual this year as previously mentioned, and also due to the gain on disposal of assets in this quarter of this year. 
Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased slightly from 22.4% last year to 22.2%, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already discussed and our increased cost. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased from 21.1% last year to 21.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment margins continue to be impacted by the additional costs related to our card processing platform migration. As Dave mentioned -- as he discussed in his opening comments, our core segment operating margins increased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while complimentary segment margins decreased slightly on a GAAP basis but improved on a non-GAAP basis compared to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 23.1% this year compared to 23.2% last year. And our net income was $72 million for the second quarter compared to $72.1 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.94 in both quarters. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 4% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service in the past. 
Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $8.9 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $10.5 million last year. Our depreciation was up 5% year-to-date, primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed into service. We purchased 675,000 shares of Jack Henry stock year-to-date for $110 million, and we paid dividends of $65.5 million for a total return to shareholders of $175.5 million year-to-date. 
Our operating cash flow was $194 million for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which is down a little from $215 million last fiscal year. We invested $76.6 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. And our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, less CapEx and less cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was $163.8 million year-to-date. 
A couple of comments on our balance sheet as of December 31. Our cash position is still in very good shape at $147.8 million, down a little from $213 million at June 30. Due to the previous items discussed, there is nothing drawn on the revolver which has a maximum capacity of $700 million. So we've got a lot of dry powder, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than the capitalized operating leases. 
In the press release yesterday, we confirmed both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance yesterday, and they were basically guided as previously in line. However, just to be clear that this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if the country is forced to shut down again due to the pandemic or the economy stalls or actually reverses, then this guidance will be revised. 
Also, I'd like to emphasize that in our GAAP guidance that we continue to forecast revenue from deconversion fees for FY '21 will be down approximately $33 million from what we saw in FY '20. We have seen $14.6 million decrease in the first half of the year alone, and we will see a significant decrease in Q3 as that was the largest quarter for deconversion revenue last fiscal year and the largest increase year-over-year. We see little to no current M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which, in the short term, as Dave mentioned, will hurt revenue growth. But in the long term, as we have always said that we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue to the long term. 
This means based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we continue to look at a GAAP revenue growth of 3- to 4-plus percent. The adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY '21 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to the previous year and the small revenue impact from the cruise divestiture in Q2 it was removed from FY '20 for comparison to FY '21. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance has not changed from Q1, the difference of all deconversion fees and revenue from the divestiture. 
We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY '21 to be down just slightly at about 22% from last year for all the reasons previously mentioned, and our non-GAAP margins to actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 at around 22%. And with the significant headwinds created by the projected significant decrease in deconversion revenue in our third fiscal quarter, we are guiding Q3 EPS to be $0.83 to $0.87, which, I believe, is generally in line with the current consensus. However, we had increased our full year EPS guidance for FY '21, which we provided last quarter, to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.80, and we are now updating our EPS guidance for FY '21 to the range of $3.85 to $3.90 with no change to our projected impact or decrease in deconversion fees. The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies. 
This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Jay, will you please open the call -- lines up for questions?"

So we've had the brakes on a little bit on the sales side, on the credit side. But there is demand there. We expect to see demand going forward. But again, it won't be -- we don't expect to be a major issuer in the future but we certainly are seeing demand from our customers."

So first, there are some that are trying to figure out whether or not the neo banks are truly competitors or not. Oftentimes, the neo banks are attracting the customer who's looking for free. And our customers, like any customer, have trouble making money on free. So sometimes they're not terribly distressed if some of those customers leave to go to somebody like Chime. I think that explains why these neo banks aren't making any money. 
But that's the short-term view, and we take a long-term view, are they going to attract the customer and then build on that customer for the long term. So a lot of our customers are trying to figure out how to compete in that space. Many of them have launched digital-only banks, digital-only brands. And of course, we support that. We've talked about that on the call before, where we're hosting a separate brand in our Jack Henry private cloud, a separate processing environment, separate marketing by the bank to make sure that they have an opportunity to attract those customers. 
The other approach that some banks are taking is trying to figure out how to partner more closely with fintechs, so not necessarily with a neo bank, but with other fintechs to enable the same type of, I'll say, cool experience, make sure that they're providing that connectivity. And of course, as I've discussed many times on this call, Jack Henry is very supportive of that environment, where we provide the hooks, provide the connectivity for fintechs to connect into our infrastructure and help our banks achieve success that way. 
So it depends on the bank. You have some who maybe put their head in the sand a little bit. You have others who are being aggressive about launching digital-only banks. And then you have some that are working with fintechs to create a whole new experience in some other way. And it just depends on the profile of the bank and their feeling of the competitive nature of those players."

So the biggest thing is core, if you think about a core replacement, anybody who makes that decision. Look, the thing I say all the time is if you're the CEO of a bank or credit union, when you decide to make a core replacement, that's the most difficult technology decision you will ever make in your role as the CEO of a bank or credit union because when you replace the core, it touches everything, right? 
You're replacing the entire guts of your processing operation. And so in this environment, the pandemic environment, where everybody had people working from home, that type of decision and that type of disruptive move was a little bit challenging for a lot of CEOs to make that move. But they still wanted to offer innovative new technologies. They need to take care of the customers, particularly, because all of their consumers were living and working from home and expected to have an outstanding digital experience so they needed to continue to implement these smaller point solutions, complementary solutions to augment the services that they provide for their consumers and that they provide internally to their employees. 
And so that's where we have this broad suite of complementary solutions, and I highlighted a few of them on the call today, that's where a lot of those things have really stepped up, particularly around digital. So there's digital banking, which we used to call online banking and mobile banking. There's digital lending. There's digital account origination. All those things have been hot commodities here lately because of that move to remote work."

So we saw our fees start to pick up in the late fall. I'll say, I highlighted on the November call, and that's absolutely true today. 
So we are today, if you look at our sales pipeline today, it is as full as it was, we'll say, 18 months ago. So 18 months ago -- let me back up a second. We normally think in terms, as we run the business, the sales pipeline you want to be -- you want to have about 90% of the annual quota for the company. At any given day, the sales pipeline should be at about 90% of the full year's quota because some deals aren't going to happen and some will happen and so on. And we're back to that level now. So we're almost about 90% of our annual quota is in the pipeline today. And that's the way I say we're -- the engine is running again where core demand has picked up, and that's part of the reason that I'm pretty optimistic about our opportunity for sales success going forward."

And so I don't expect -- I'll say, ever -- maybe that's too dramatic, but I don't expect ever to get back to our operating model for banks and credit unions to be like it was 2 years ago. They'll have a remote workforce going forward, just like we will. So that is not the trigger. 
I think now it's them understanding how to run the business with a combination of in-office and remote, and they recognize they need to do a technology upgrade. Okay, now let's get down to business and make that decision and move forward with the technology upgrade. And then we can do conversion -- core conversions, 100% remote.

Obviously, there're some -- there's a lot of moving parts, a lot of strange things going on in our financials right now. Is there some potential upside for Q4? Absolutely. But when you look at Q3, I mean, some of the big savings we got were definitely travel-related because our people just aren't moving because of restrictions and different things. But that also impacts revenue. 
So as I mentioned some of them in my comments, I mean, license, hardware, implementation, billable travel is all down. And so when we do get to start traveling again, the travel expense will go up and we -- and our salespeople are starting to get out there and move a little bit, and some of our installs are moving a little bit more. So our travel cost is going to go up. Yes, some of that's billable, which also increased revenue. But remember that in our business, the revenue is all kind of delayed. 
So even though our travel expenses may go up and other costs go up, the revenue related to that travel is probably not going to happen for a quarter or more. So there's potential for some negative impact on margins in the short term, but it's going to drag along all that revenue. So I -- so you're absolutely right, there is some potential upside from our Q4. And once we get in -- get past this and into more of a regular cadence, I think, we can go right back into that regular margin expansion that we've seen historically."

Now can I predict exactly when things will sign and close? That's -- it's more art than science when it comes to timing on those things. But if we assume that we'll win at the same rate that we're winning -- that we were winning pre pandemic, and we know that the pipeline is at about the same level as it was pre pandemic, logically, we can assume, I think, that sometime later this calendar year, the rate of wins will be similar to what we were experiencing pre pandemic. 
And then the thing to keep in mind is once we sign a new core deal, the revenue doesn't hit the P&L. The majority of the revenue doesn't hit the P&L, oftentimes for at least a year afterwards. And once we start a conversion, that conversion is a major impact to the financial institution, as I was highlighting earlier, some people call it rip and replace where you're taking everything out and replacing it with a brand-new system. Well, that takes many months of planning and operation to get that conversion completed.

But what I do expect, as we just talked about in the last question is more on the core-signing side. I expect as we go forward that we'll start to see more on the core-signing side. 
The thing that will be interesting to watch is, can we sustain the pace that we've seen on the complementary side. Because if we can increase core bookings and sustain the complementary bookings, that's significant, that's meaningful. I'm not ready to say that, that's achievable, but that will certainly be our objective. And I think we have the opportunity to do that because we're getting all of this great recognition for some of this wonderful technology that we've been rolling out here, particularly in the area of digital.

So the big thing, I mean, if you're going to go back 6 or 7 years, and you really can't go back that far because you can really only go back to 2017 because when we restated for ASC 606, that was the farthest back we went. So you really can't look be",386,"Yes.

So you really can't look beyond that and get a true comparison of margins because ASC 606 definitely changed how we recognize revenue and had a significant impact on margins. 
But from '17 forward, the primary impact on our margins has been 2 things. One, the migration to the new card platform has increased our cost because we haven't been able to reduce any cost until we get through the migration, which, as Dave said in his opening comments, is going to be complete at the end of March. So we will start to see that cost savings. We'll see a nice rebound in margins in Q4 and then a full year of that cost reduction in FY '22. 
The other thing that's happened since '17 is we have literally sold no new core business. So there's been virtually no new core license revenue which is very high-margin business happening in the last 3 or 4 years. I mean on the bank side, I think, we have sold maybe 3 or 4 in-house deals since 2017. On the crediting side, not bearing any more than that. And most of those were smaller bank deals for our core director solution. So we -- so those are the 2 primary drivers as COGS at marts come down. 
Now what's going to happen is, like I said, you'll see margin improve in Q4. We'll continue to see it improve in the following year. We have gone through the transition of getting -- I mean, our license and hardware revenue is now very small percentage of our total revenue, so very little impact from that. So as we continue to migrate our -- in -- our on-prem customers to our private cloud and continue to sell additional card business and our card -- and our private cloud business continues to become a much larger percentage of our total revenue, that's a very high-margin business. Our margins will continue to grow and get back to the historical rates in FY '23 and beyond."

We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business.

We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. 
We remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our HR teams continue to work closely with all groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and have now updated our return-to-office date to July 1. 
At this point, I don't anticipate us extending that date, although I definitely expect long-lasting changes to our in-office work model. Most of our customers now have many people physically in their locations every day, and we regularly receive requests to deliver on-site sales engagements and system implementations. As I mentioned on the last call, our sales teams are routinely doing sales presentations and executing contracts with no on-site presence at the customer location. We have also completed many 100% remote implementations with great success, including several full core conversions. 
With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in December. For Q2 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $5.5 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts the current quarter negatively, but as we have highlighted in the past, is good news if you take a long-term view. 
Turning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 1% for the quarter and increased by 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 2% increase in revenue this quarter and a 3% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions business with a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 4% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams, again, had a very solid quarter as they booked the fifth largest sales quarter in the history of the company. We inked 6 competitive core takeaways and 12 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. On previous calls, I highlighted the fact that our competitive core signings have slowed a bit as a result of the pandemic and that was also true in Q2. With that in mind, you may ask how it was possible for us to book the fifth largest quarter in history with less than the new core win category. Of course, this happens because the sales teams have had tremendous success with our broad suite of complementary offerings, including digital, fraud and payment solutions. 
During the quarter, we signed 61 new clients to our Banno Digital Suite, 6 new clients on our treasury management platform and 11 new clients on our Card Processing Solution. Of course, all of these contracts represent new revenue to Jack Henry. As I mentioned last quarter, we continued to implement more than 30 new financial institution clients every month on our Banno Digital platform. As of February 1, we now have more than 4 million users on the platform but that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, our Banno platform has been recognized by FI Navigator as having the highest consumer rating in the App store, and we are continuing to receive accolades as the fastest application in the industry. If you combine our inroads in the digital banking space, with our ongoing success with digital lending and digital account opening, we see great things ahead for Jack Henry as a leader in this area. 
Regarding our new card processing platform, as of the end of December, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our core clients and many of our non-core clients. We will complete all of the migrations next month as previously announced. You will start to see the larger positive impact on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter as we have emphasized throughout the project. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. 
Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that its FedNow team has been working closely with a few companies over the past year to help them design and develop the FedNow network. We have been very active with the FedNow team for more than a year, and we're excited to participate in their pilot program. We look forward to bringing many financial institutions live through our payments hub, which we have branded Jack Henry PayCenter. 
As I've discussed previously, our PayCenter solution was designed to provide connectivity through a single platform to multiple real-time payments providers, which facilitates a more logical and efficient approach for our clients than any other processor in the market today. Additionally, it allows us to connect clients to the real-time payments network in groups rather than one at a time, which is a significant enhancement over any other offering in the industry. 
In addition to working with the Fed on the FedNow program, many of you know that we have also been very involved in the rollout of the PPP program through the first 2 rounds last year and the latest round earlier this year. We are currently working with many of our financial institution clients to help submit and process thousands of PPP loans with their current pipeline totaling almost $1 billion in loans to small businesses around the country. 
Hopefully, many of you noticed that we released our first corporate sustainability report on December 31. Although I'm very proud of the report and its contents, I think it's important to note that Jack Henry has practiced the concepts of corporate responsibility since our founding. This report is our way of summarizing the standards and practices we've been dedicated to for more than 40 years and which are evident every day as we strive in all cases to adhere to our guiding principle of doing the right thing. In the report, we discussed our commitments to our 5 key stakeholders: our employees, customers, stockholders, communities and the environment. 
Our investment in corporate responsibility is embodied through our commitment to: enabling our associates to engage in meaningful work that they love; providing innovative financial solutions to our customers to support responsible business decisions and keep their clients connected, delivering a strong return on investment to our stockholders while maintaining long-term sustainability for our business model; encouraging our communities to flourish by connecting people with technology; and pursuing environmentally friendly practices to support a strong future for us all. 
In January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of their annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, 73% of banks in our target market expect to increase their technology spending as they rebound from the pandemic in 2021, with 22% of them indicating an increase of greater than 10% year-over-year. This correlates with the information we're receiving from other sources, which puts the average expected increase in tech spending for 2021 in our market at around 5%. I think that pent-up demand is reflected in the continued influx of RFPs we're receiving and the ongoing interest in Jack Henry technology solutions. 
As we begin the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."
277617,702444952,2201157,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter a",1415,"Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter and deconversion fees of $7.7 million revenue and divestitures of $1.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter, this revenue line would have grown 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year. 
Service and support revenue primary driver was data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud, which continues to show very strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year. However, the growth in that line was totally offset by a decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which is due to decreased license; hardware and imitation revenue for primarily on-premise customers; pass-through revenue, which is related to our billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations related to COVID; and our Jack Henry Annual Conference, or our JAC, which was held virtually, and therefore, no registration fees for customers or vendors for our tech fair. 
And then obviously, as mentioned, deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year, which is all those lines were a decrease. Processing revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. 
Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage growth of all revenue lines in both Q2 and year-to-date this year compared to the same periods last year. Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter, as Dave mentioned, compared to last year on a GAAP basis and was up a little over 2% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of deconversion fees and revenue from divestitures. Our cost of revenue was up 3% compared to last year second quarter. This increase was due -- primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at December 31 compared to a year ago quarter. The increase in cost was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result, again, of COVID travel limitations. 
Our research and development expense decreased 1% for the quarter compared to last year. This decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of our overall costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily almost completely due to travel-related expense savings as a result of COVID-19, which required us to hold our JAC virtual this year as previously mentioned, and also due to the gain on disposal of assets in this quarter of this year. 
Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased slightly from 22.4% last year to 22.2%, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already discussed and our increased cost. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased from 21.1% last year to 21.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment margins continue to be impacted by the additional costs related to our card processing platform migration. As Dave mentioned -- as he discussed in his opening comments, our core segment operating margins increased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while complimentary segment margins decreased slightly on a GAAP basis but improved on a non-GAAP basis compared to last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 23.1% this year compared to 23.2% last year. And our net income was $72 million for the second quarter compared to $72.1 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.94 in both quarters. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 4% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service in the past. 
Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $8.9 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $10.5 million last year. Our depreciation was up 5% year-to-date, primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed into service. We purchased 675,000 shares of Jack Henry stock year-to-date for $110 million, and we paid dividends of $65.5 million for a total return to shareholders of $175.5 million year-to-date. 
Our operating cash flow was $194 million for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, which is down a little from $215 million last fiscal year. We invested $76.6 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. And our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, less CapEx and less cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was $163.8 million year-to-date. 
A couple of comments on our balance sheet as of December 31. Our cash position is still in very good shape at $147.8 million, down a little from $213 million at June 30. Due to the previous items discussed, there is nothing drawn on the revolver which has a maximum capacity of $700 million. So we've got a lot of dry powder, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than the capitalized operating leases. 
In the press release yesterday, we confirmed both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance yesterday, and they were basically guided as previously in line. However, just to be clear that this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if the country is forced to shut down again due to the pandemic or the economy stalls or actually reverses, then this guidance will be revised. 
Also, I'd like to emphasize that in our GAAP guidance that we continue to forecast revenue from deconversion fees for FY '21 will be down approximately $33 million from what we saw in FY '20. We have seen $14.6 million decrease in the first half of the year alone, and we will see a significant decrease in Q3 as that was the largest quarter for deconversion revenue last fiscal year and the largest increase year-over-year. We see little to no current M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which, in the short term, as Dave mentioned, will hurt revenue growth. But in the long term, as we have always said that we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue to the long term. 
This means based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we continue to look at a GAAP revenue growth of 3- to 4-plus percent. The adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY '21 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to the previous year and the small revenue impact from the cruise divestiture in Q2 it was removed from FY '20 for comparison to FY '21. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance has not changed from Q1, the difference of all deconversion fees and revenue from the divestiture. 
We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY '21 to be down just slightly at about 22% from last year for all the reasons previously mentioned, and our non-GAAP margins to actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 at around 22%. And with the significant headwinds created by the projected significant decrease in deconversion revenue in our third fiscal quarter, we are guiding Q3 EPS to be $0.83 to $0.87, which, I believe, is generally in line with the current consensus. However, we had increased our full year EPS guidance for FY '21, which we provided last quarter, to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.80, and we are now updating our EPS guidance for FY '21 to the range of $3.85 to $3.90 with no change to our projected impact or decrease in deconversion fees. The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies. 
This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Jay, will you please open the call -- lines up for questions?"

So we've had the brakes on a little bit on the sales side, on the credit side. But there is demand there. We expect to see demand going forward. But again, it won't be -- we don't expect to be a major issuer in the future but we certainly are seeing demand from our customers."

So first, there are some that are trying to figure out whether or not the neo banks are truly competitors or not. Oftentimes, the neo banks are attracting the customer who's looking for free. And our customers, like any customer, have trouble making money on free. So sometimes they're not terribly distressed if some of those customers leave to go to somebody like Chime. I think that explains why these neo banks aren't making any money. 
But that's the short-term view, and we take a long-term view, are they going to attract the customer and then build on that customer for the long term. So a lot of our customers are trying to figure out how to compete in that space. Many of them have launched digital-only banks, digital-only brands. And of course, we support that. We've talked about that on the call before, where we're hosting a separate brand in our Jack Henry private cloud, a separate processing environment, separate marketing by the bank to make sure that they have an opportunity to attract those customers. 
The other approach that some banks are taking is trying to figure out how to partner more closely with fintechs, so not necessarily with a neo bank, but with other fintechs to enable the same type of, I'll say, cool experience, make sure that they're providing that connectivity. And of course, as I've discussed many times on this call, Jack Henry is very supportive of that environment, where we provide the hooks, provide the connectivity for fintechs to connect into our infrastructure and help our banks achieve success that way. 
So it depends on the bank. You have some who maybe put their head in the sand a little bit. You have others who are being aggressive about launching digital-only banks. And then you have some that are working with fintechs to create a whole new experience in some other way. And it just depends on the profile of the bank and their feeling of the competitive nature of those players."

So the biggest thing is core, if you think about a core replacement, anybody who makes that decision. Look, the thing I say all the time is if you're the CEO of a bank or credit union, when you decide to make a core replacement, that's the most difficult technology decision you will ever make in your role as the CEO of a bank or credit union because when you replace the core, it touches everything, right? 
You're replacing the entire guts of your processing operation. And so in this environment, the pandemic environment, where everybody had people working from home, that type of decision and that type of disruptive move was a little bit challenging for a lot of CEOs to make that move. But they still wanted to offer innovative new technologies. They need to take care of the customers, particularly, because all of their consumers were living and working from home and expected to have an outstanding digital experience so they needed to continue to implement these smaller point solutions, complementary solutions to augment the services that they provide for their consumers and that they provide internally to their employees. 
And so that's where we have this broad suite of complementary solutions, and I highlighted a few of them on the call today, that's where a lot of those things have really stepped up, particularly around digital. So there's digital banking, which we used to call online banking and mobile banking. There's digital lending. There's digital account origination. All those things have been hot commodities here lately because of that move to remote work."

So we saw our fees start to pick up in the late fall. I'll say, I highlighted on the November call, and that's absolutely true today. 
So we are today, if you look at our sales pipeline today, it is as full as it was, we'll say, 18 months ago. So 18 months ago -- let me back up a second. We normally think in terms, as we run the business, the sales pipeline you want to be -- you want to have about 90% of the annual quota for the company. At any given day, the sales pipeline should be at about 90% of the full year's quota because some deals aren't going to happen and some will happen and so on. And we're back to that level now. So we're almost about 90% of our annual quota is in the pipeline today. And that's the way I say we're -- the engine is running again where core demand has picked up, and that's part of the reason that I'm pretty optimistic about our opportunity for sales success going forward."

They'll have a remote workforce going forward, just like we will. So that is not the trigger. 
I think now it's them understanding how to run the business with a combination of in-office and remote, and they recognize they need to do a technology upgrade.

Obviously, there're some -- there's a lot of moving parts, a lot of strange things going on in our financials right now. Is there some potential upside for Q4? Absolutely. But when you look at Q3, I mean, some of the big savings we got were definitely travel-related because our people just aren't moving because of restrictions and different things. But that also impacts revenue. 
So as I mentioned some of them in my comments, I mean, license, hardware, implementation, billable travel is all down. And so when we do get to start traveling again, the travel expense will go up and we -- and our salespeople are starting to get out there and move a little bit, and some of our installs are moving a little bit more. So our travel cost is going to go up. Yes, some of that's billable, which also increased revenue. But remember that in our business, the revenue is all kind of delayed. 
So even though our travel expenses may go up and other costs go up, the revenue related to that travel is probably not going to happen for a quarter or more. So there's potential for some negative impact on margins in the short term, but it's going to drag along all that revenue. So I -- so you're absolutely right, there is some potential upside from our Q4. And once we get in -- get past this and into more of a regular cadence, I think, we can go right back into that regular margin expansion that we've seen historically."

But if we assume that we'll win at the same rate that we're winning -- that we were winning pre pandemic, and we know that the pipeline is at about the same level as it was pre pandemic, logically, we can assume, I think, that sometime later this calendar year, the rate of wins will be similar to what we were experiencing pre pandemic. 
And then the thing to keep in mind is once we sign a new core deal, the revenue doesn't hit the P&L. The majority of the revenue doesn't hit the P&L, oftentimes for at least a year afterwards. And once we start a conversion, that conversion is a major impact to the financial institution, as I was highlighting earlier, some people call it rip and replace where you're taking everything out and replacing it with a brand-new system. Well, that takes many months of planning and operation to get that conversion completed.

But what I do expect, as we just talked about in the last question is more on the core-signing side. I expect as we go forward that we'll start to see more on the core-signing side. 
The thing that will be interesting to watch is, can we sustain the pace that we've seen on the complementary side. Because if we can increase core bookings and sustain the complementary bookings, that's significant, that's meaningful. I'm not ready to say that, that's achievable, but that will certainly be our objective.

So the big thing, I mean, if you're going to go back 6 or 7 years, and you really can't go back that far because you can really only go back to 2017 because when we restated for ASC 606, that was the farthest back we went.

So the big thing, I mean, if you're going to go back 6 or 7 years, and you really can't go back that far because you can really only go back to 2017 because when we restated for ASC 606, that was the farthest back we went. So you really can't look beyond that and get a true comparison of margins because ASC 606 definitely changed how we recognize revenue and had a significant impact on margins. 
But from '17 forward, the primary impact on our margins has been 2 things. One, the migration to the new card platform has increased our cost because we haven't been able to reduce any cost until we get through the migration, which, as Dave said in his opening comments, is going to be complete at the end of March. So we will start to see that cost savings. We'll see a nice rebound in margins in Q4 and then a full year of that cost reduction in FY '22. 
The other thing that's happened since '17 is we have literally sold no new core business. So there's been virtually no new core license revenue which is very high-margin business happening in the last 3 or 4 years. I mean on the bank side, I think, we have sold maybe 3 or 4 in-house deals since 2017. On the crediting side, not bearing any more than that. And most of those were smaller bank deals for our core director solution. So we -- so those are the 2 primary drivers as COGS at marts come down. 
Now what's going to happen is, like I said, you'll see margin improve in Q4. We'll continue to see it improve in the following year. We have gone through the transition of getting -- I mean, our license and hardware revenue is now very small percentage of our total revenue, so very little impact from that. So as we continue to migrate our -- in -- our on-prem customers to our private cloud and continue to sell additional card business and our card -- and our private cloud business continues to become a much larger percentage of our total revenue, that's a very high-margin business. Our margins will continue to grow and get back to the historical rates in FY '23 and beyond."

277617,712097144,2268126,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.

We're very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. 
For Q3 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $18 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts revenue in the current quarter negatively. But as I've highlighted many times in the past, this is good news for our company if you take a long-term view. 
Turning to the segments. We again had a good quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue decreased 4% for the quarter because of the reduction in deconversion fees, but increased by 3% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary Solutions businesses, with a 1% increase in revenue this quarter and a 5% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
As I mentioned in the press release, our core sales teams had an extremely solid quarter and are now seeing core activity consistent with our pre pandemic run rate. During the quarter, we inked 15 competitive core takeaways which is greater than the 1 per week run rate we saw in 2019. 
In addition to our success signing Nucor clients, we signed 6 existing onprem core customers to move to our private cloud environment. As we continue to push into the larger regional bank space, I think it's significant to note that of the 15 new core deals in the quarter, 5 were with multibillion-dollar asset banks and credit unions. As a reminder, regarding the topic of new core wins, at Jack Henry, we only call out new core deals when a banker credit union moves their entire core processing relationship from a competitor system to a Jack Henry core solution. We do not announce them as a new core win if they move from 1 Jack Henry core to another or if they simply purchase a new module from us. Think of it as a new logo on the Jack Henry core customer list that wasn't there previously. 
In addition to the tremendous success we saw with our core business this quarter, we continued to sign new clients to our new digital offerings. During the third quarter, we signed 42 new clients to our Banno platform, and we continue to see increased interest in this offering as well as the rest of our digital suite. In our April 6 press release regarding digital momentum, we shared that we had more than 400 financial institutions and more than 4.3 million users live on the Banno platform. 
As of May 1, however, we have added several more financial institutions and we now have just over 5 million users live. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. As I've said before, I expect our success in this area to grow as we continue to add new functionality and features to the platform. 
Regarding the ongoing migrations of our new card processing platform, as of the end of March, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our debit processing customers to the new platform in accordance with the plan we've been discussing for more than 3 years. Here are a few statistics regarding this remarkably successful project. 
We did our first migration on October 30, 2017, and completed the project on March 26, 2021. That's 1,243 days. During that time, we migrated 879 customers and added 151 new debit and credit customers to the platform. We currently support 1,030 banks and credit unions on the platform and we're adding new clients every month. 
You will start to see the larger positive impact of this completed project on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter as we have emphasized throughout the process. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. 
As you probably heard, M&A has become a topic again among bankers, now that they're more confident about their operating models and the overall economy. Several of our clients have approached us recently to work with them as they prepare to complete acquisitions of smaller institutions. 
In fact, the CEOs of 2 regional banks currently processed by Jack Henry, were quoted in an American Banker article last week regarding their desire to pick up where they left off before the pandemic brought everything to a halt. We expect our activity and what we refer to as the convert merge area of our business to pick up again as we get into the summer months and new deals are announced. 
Speaking of American Banker, hopefully, you all saw their article last month announcing that once again, Jack Henry has been recognized by their team as a Best Place to Work in fintech. American banker only recognizes 50 companies each year. And as you can probably imagine, almost all of the companies on the fintech list generate less than $100 million in annual revenue pretty much in keeping with the type of company most people think of when they hear the word fintech. 
We are particularly proud of this recognition for a few reasons: first, the scores are based on surveys conducted with our employees by an independent agency; second, this is our fifth year in a row to receive this designation from American Banker; third, we are many times larger than almost any other company on the list; and fourth, none of our larger competitors have ever made this list. I think this recognition is indicative of the culture, entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to developing truly innovative solutions found within the teams at Jack Henry. 
As you have undoubtedly already noted from yesterday's press release, we purchased a significant number of shares in the quarter, with a lack of good quality acquisitions for us to pursue and with our stock at an attractive price, we worked with the Board to authorize an additional repurchase under the existing plan, which enabled us to buy 1,825,000 shares during the quarter. 
This significant share repurchase does not foreshadow a change in our strategy in this regard. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to purchasing our own shares as we have excess cash and the lack of acquisition targets that fit our strategy. 
Hopefully, you've all seen the press release we posted this morning, announcing the upcoming retirement of our longtime Chairman, Jack Prim. Of course, many of you know, Jack is the guy who sat in this chair before I became CEO at Jack Henry. As I said in today's press release, Jack has given many years to our company as a business leader, a Board member and a friend to us all. He has had a significant impact on the success of our company and on me personally. And for that, I want to sincerely thank him on behalf of all of us at Jack Henry. 
Recognizing that Jack has been considering a potential retirement for some time, we were prepared for his decision and expect our process to allow us to fill the vacancy close in time to Jack's retirement date. We hope to have more information to share regarding a new Board member and a new Chairman before the end of June. 
Slowly but surely, our customers are settling into a new mode of operation with the anticipation of most COVID restrictions being lifted in the coming months. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote, but we are committed to our return to office date of July 1. We are finalizing plans for office usage and staffing that will employ a hybrid work-from-home, work-in-office strategy and we will continue to leverage remote sales and implementation tools where possible. We still have some work to do and some things to learn, but I'm very optimistic about our ability to be successful as the work environment shifts again post COVID. 
As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our virtual analyst conference next week. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."

For the quarter, our services port revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago.

For the quarter, our services port revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting that service to support revenue for deconversion fees of $4.367 million in the current quarter and deconversion fees of $22.8 million and revenue from divestitures last year in the prior fiscal quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, this revenue line would have grown actually 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year, which, obviously, as Dave mentioned, that has a lot of pressure and headwinds from our convert merge revenue and also hardware in the quarter. 
Year-to-date, our deconversion fees are now down $33 million compared to the prior year, which, if you remember the guidance that we provided back in August, that is right in line with the full year impact. Service support revenue, primary driver was data processing and hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, however, the growth in that line was totally offset by a decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which, again, was due to our decreased hardware implementation revenue for onprem customers convert merge implementations, which is also down to the significant decrease in M&A activity, pass-through revenue that is related to billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations by COVID and then obviously, deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which was down almost $18 million. 
Processing revenue increased 13% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and also increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage of growth of all revenue lines in both Q3 and year-to-date this year compared to the same periods last year. 
Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and was up 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Cost of revenue was up 4% compared to last year's second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at March 31 compared to a year ago. 
The increase in costs was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result of COVID travel limitations. Our research and development expense decreased 3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 over the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to a higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product development as we continue to invest in our products this quarter compared to a year ago. 
Our SG&A expense decreased 6% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 over the same quarter and this decrease was primarily due to travel-related savings. Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased from 21.4% last year to 21% this year, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already pointed out and increased cost. However, on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased nicely and we saw strong margin expansion from 18.1% last year to 20.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. 
Our payments segment margins were impacted by deconversion fees in the quarter. But on a non-GAAP basis, our payments margin improved slightly with the completion of the platform migration. Both our core and complementary segments had a decrease in GAAP margins, but both of them had a nice increase in non-GAAP margins. So our underlying operations continue to be very strong as we move forward through the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was 21.5%, up from 19.7% in the same quarter a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in the timing of the release of respective reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from varying statute limitation periods. 
Our net income was $71.4 million in the third quarter compared to $73.9 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.95 for the current quarter compared to 96% -- $0.96 last year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 3% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed in service in the prior year. Included in this total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions which decreased $13.3 million -- or to $13.3 million this year compared to $15.4 million last year. 
Depreciation is up 3% due to the date primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed in service. As Dave mentioned, we've purchased 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $384.4 million, and we paid dividends of just right at $100 million for a total return to shareholders of $484.2 million year-to-date. 
Our operating cash flow was $266.3 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which is down a little from $276 million last year, which is also impacted by the significant decrease in deconversion fees this year-to-date compared to last year. We invested $116.7 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software year-to-date. 
Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets is $155.8 million year-to-date. 
A couple of comments on our balance sheet. Our cash position of $70.1 million compared to $109.5 million a year ago. So we still have decent cash for operations. We did drawdown $200 million on our revolver during the quarter to fund our stock buybacks, but we have no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than operating leases. 
Our return on invested capital for our trailing 12 months is 19.2% and our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 20.9%, which is very solid. 
For update on our guidance, we did update both our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for the full fiscal year. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. But if things do go differently, then obviously, this guidance will be revised. 
We've been very consistent with our GAAP guidance that revenue from deconversion fees would be a decrease of approximately $33 million compared to last year, which we hit that mark, as I previously said, during our fiscal Q3. And it now appears the deconversion revenue will actually be down by another $4 million in Q4 compared to the previous year for a total decrease of approximately $37 million in deconversion fees compared to the last fiscal year. 
We continue to see no immediate M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which in the short-term will hurt -- will continue to hurt our revenue growth for the fiscal year. But in long term, as we have always said, that we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue for the long term. This means, based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we expect GAAP revenue to growth in FY '21 to be 3% to 3.5%. 
The adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY '21 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to the previous year and the small revenue impact from the cruise divestiture during Q2 that was removed from FY '20 for comparison purposes. For non-GAAP revenue growth guidance provided in the release, we are now guiding to approximately 6% growth due to the ongoing headwinds previously discussed in the various lines of revenue. So we still anticipate we're going to grow 6% this year, which means Q4 is going to have a really nice revenue growth to get our slightly less than 5% year-to-date up to that 6% for the year. 
We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY '21 to be down slightly at about 22% compared to last year for all the reasons we discussed. And non-GAAP margins should actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year, similar to what we've seen through the first 3 quarters. 
Our effective tax rate for the full year of FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 rate at around 22%, assuming there are no federal or state tax law changes between now and the end the year that would impact our fiscal year. We've also increased our full year EPS guidance for FY '21 again this quarter, which we provided last quarter, a range of $3.85 to $3.90. We are now updating our EPS guidance for FY '21 to a range of $3.98 to $4.02. 
The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies, which is offsetting the impact of deconversion fees. 
With that, this concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Brandy, will you please open the call lines up for questions."

So there's -- all the cost savings is not going to be in this quarter. In fact, there's other things that we're still having to do through the end of December, I believe, for some programming and different things to get the full efficiencies out of the new platforms. So it's probably going to be Q3 of next fiscal year that we had the full quarterly impact of that $16 million plus savings, but we're going to start getting some this quarter. So you will see some payments margin expansion in Q4, and then you'll see more in Q1 and Q2 and then even more in Q3 next year."

I won't say that there's been any major shift in this quarter. We started to see a shift in the -- earlier in the fiscal year for a heavy emphasis on digital and things that would allow our our customers' customers, so whether it's a consumer or a commercial customer, allow them to conduct more business without coming into the branch. So the digital platform has, of course, been right at the front of that list, I'll reemphasize what I said in my opening comments here. In the press release we put out on April 6, we said we had around 400 institutions and 4.3 million users live. A month later, on May 4, we now have more than 5 million users live. So it really, I think, emphasizes the dramatic shift that's happening among banks and credit unions to ensure that their consumers and their commercial customers have best-of-breed digital technology for them to view. So that's been a key driver for our customers and certainly for us. Treasury is another piece of that puzzle. So I didn't call it out. And we have 12 so far this year as far as treasury, new customers that are signed to the treasury platform. Again, that's a move toward more digital functionality, but for very large commercial customers. You don't install a treasury solution unless you have really large commercial customers. Otherwise, they just use cash management. So that, I think, is indicative. And then on the lending side, I've highlighted this many times that's allowing a commercial customer to do complex commercial loans online without having to drive to the branch with their financial statements and all that packet of information. The thing that we have just recently done there is we've added this lending marketplace functionality where customers, if they have a credit that's too large for them to book. They can essentially sell that credit through a marketplace to other lenders who want to take on the responsibility for that credit. So there's a lot of activity in all of those areas, but it is this shift toward doing business more in a digital environment as opposed to coming into the branch. That's what's driving all of those things that I just touched on."

We have really successfully shifted to enabling our sales team and customers being accepting of doing business remote. They still like to have people come in once a while and some customers insist on the sales rep coming in. But we're doing a lot of this remote. A lot of the demonstrations that we do now are normally where we would have had 5 or 6 people on site. We'll maybe have 1 or 2 on site, and the other 4 are on a team's call or on a Zoom call doing the demonstration. So customers have really become to -- gotten the point where they'll accept that idea of much of the single happening virtually. And so what that's created now is and I think I've said this on calls before, we -- a good gauge for us of how out our sales pipeline is is if we are at about 90% of our annual quota, so not a monthly quota. But the annual quota at any given time, on any given day, if we have about 90% of the annual quota in the pipeline, then we know that we've got enough happening that we should be able to make our number. We are right at that mark right now. And so what that tells me is customers are engaging with us. They have salespeople working with them on deals. And we're kind of back to a normal run rate that we would have seen in 2019, that's what we're seeing today in the sales pipeline. So the number of engagements and the volume of deals that are flowing through the pipe are about where we were in 2019."

Can I say with absolute certainty that we're going to do 52 deals next year? No. But it's certainly the pace right now and everything that we see in the pipeline for the next coming months, the pace is definitely greater than it has been during COVID-19 during the depths of COVID-19, I guess I'll put it that way. And it's logical, I don't think anybody should be surprised that there was a slowdown in those core decisions during the pandemic because as we've talked about before, when you're the CEO of a bank or credit union, you decide to switch out your core, that's essentially making a decision to do heart and lung transplant all at the same time for your institution, and it's a very disruptive, no matter how smooth it goes, it's a disruptive process. And why would you make that decision unless you absolutely have to. Why would you make that decision in the midst of a global pandemic. And so I think it's totally logical that we're back to that pace. All -- if you take COVID out of the picture, all the other reasons for a customer to move to Jack Henry, those are all there still, just like they were in 2019. And so I think these bank and credit union executives are seeing that now. They know how to manage through in the COVID world, and now they're back to thinking about how do I find a best-of-breed provider on the core side, and let's go talk to Jack Henry."

I mean, I said earlier that our non-GAAP is going to finish up pretty much in line -- slightly up from where it was last year. It's -- we will gain more than 100 bps in operating margin in FY '22. And could it be more than that? Yes. But I think, as I said earlier, it's going to take us some additional time. As Dave just said, it's going to take some time to take out all these costs taken out, and it's actually going to be by the end of the second quarter, I believe when we get all the costs taken out, so you're going to see some continued margin improvement throughout next fiscal year, and it will be Q3 when you see the full impact of what the cost takeout for the payment migration but as we continue to add new payments customers as we continue to add new core customers as we continue to migrate our on-prem customers to our private cloud, all those things will help our margins. The other thing that I think a lot of people forget about is with the M&A activity, obviously, our deconversion fees are down. But on the other side that is in our -- both our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers is what and Dave alluded to in his opening comments is our convert merge revenue because our customers do a lot of acquiring as well. So we've had some significant headwinds this fiscal year on our convert merger revenue, we have done no risks or layoffs. So we still have all the costs so just having some -- the M&A activity picking up, will not only give us back some deconversion fee revenue, which we really don't want, that will also help with convert merge revenue, which -- that will also help our operating margins. There's so many positive things that's going to help our operating margins as things get back to normal, David.. One comment I'll add here while you're shifting to a new questioner. I didn't call it out in my comments, but just since Dave asked about the impacts of this platform conversion, Kevin pointed out that we're continuing to add new customers. I didn't call it in my comments, but we added 13 more brand-new customers to that platform during the quarter. So this really is a growth driver for us now that we're through the migration. We're continuing to add customers to that platform, net new."

Our customers are much happier. They're definitely referenceable, which is what's leading to all of these successes in signing new customers to the platform. So it really has been the right move for Jack Henry. It was a long-term project, and it was pain along the way because you're disrupting all these customers, but it really was the right decision. It's been a good move for us, for our customers. And so we're well positioned for growth in the future. And the 1 thing I'll emphasize that we've talked about on previous calls, haven't talked about it in a while, but our old platform was dependent on a Jack Henry core system or for the old eplatforms to the function. This new platform is not dependent on a Jack Henry core system, which means we can sell debit and credit outside the Jack Henry core base, which we couldn't do in the past.

And what I've highlighted in the past is we are intensely focused right now on delivering Mano business, which is the other big chunk. So Banno, so far, has been positioned as a consumer application. No business will be delivered later this year. And by the way, those of you who attend the Analyst Day next week. Amy, who runs digital for us is going to update you on that panel business and kind of what that means for us. But Banno business will be delivered later this calendar year. And so once we have Banno consumer and Banno business all up and running and live and good to go, then we start selling outside the Jack Henry core base. So that will be later in 2020 -- calendar 2022 is when we'll start selling outside the core base. But we want to make sure that we have everything tighten right with our core customers before we start to go after sales outside the Jack Henry core base. But we definitely will be doing that. And right now, the target is late calendar 2022. 
And I'd just add one thing to that is -- so if you think about, Steve, I mean, right now, we are at about just over 20% of our core customers that are using Banno. So we've got an enormous amount of runway. And obviously, as Dave said, we want to take care of our core customers. The other thing I'd point out is we've actually -- and I've never seen this. I've been in this business for a long time. I've never seen a complementary product actually win a core deal. And we've actually won some very nice core wins because we are only selling Banno to our core customers. So it's -- that's another reason to make sure we've taken care of all of our core -- our own core customers before we start going outside the base."

Is the revenue opportunity similar for each product? Or how would you handicap that? That's a good question. I would say, a commercial customer tends to pay more for that functionality than a consumer does, but you don't have as many of them to work with at each institution. So depending on the makeup of the institution, if they're highly commercial focused, I'd say there's a greater opportunity at that institution. If they're primarily consumer-focused retail then there's a lesser opportunity. So it just depends on the institution, the makeup of the institution. But if they're heavily commercial, there is a significant opportunity once we roll out that functionality. So we'll go around to our existing customers who are running Banno consumer. He'll be first on the list to say, okay, now we have bound for business. Let's add that, and that will be essentially the easy button for those customers that have already deployed the panel for their consumer base."

Share buybacks continue to be an option for us, particularly when the share price is down like it was here a few months ago, that's what really drove us to get more active with the board and make a significant move."

Jack Henry has been a player in the multibillion-dollar space for well over 10 years. So if we were having this call 15 years ago, I would totally agree with what you just said. We were not a player in the multibillion-dollar space. But for the past 10, 15 years, we have continue to grow in that space. We are the dominant player on the credit union side, almost 50%, and you'll see the numbers next week at the analyst conference. I can't quote it exactly off the top of my head, but close to 50% of the over $1 billion credit unions run our Jack Henry Episys solution. So we are by far the dominant player on the credit union side with a single platform. On the banking side, we have somewhere around 23% to 25% of the multibillion-dollar market running on almost all of them on our Silver Lake platform. We've continued to push up market. It is a key part of our strategy. We have continued to add functionality over the years, and we are winning in that space. Regularly, just as I emphasized on the call today. So we have -- we are not the little brother in the multibillion-dollar banking space. We are definitely a player. But the question for us is, historically, we have been below about $50 billion. And so one of the things that Stacy will talk about at the Analyst Day next week is that we are -- we do have an initiative to move above $50 billion because that has not been a market that we've been in historically. We've been below $50 billion, but we have teams, and we've been actively working in that space as well. So we definitely are not targeting smaller banks. In fact, if you're a credit union blow, about $100 million in assets or a bank below, about $200 million in assets, Jack Henry generally is not the fit. We're the fit for right around $1 billion is a real sweet spot for us. But as I mentioned, we've continued to grow up market here for many years."

I'm concerned that you may have a little bit of a misconception about deconversion fees. So when we get deconversion fees, that's because one of our customers has been acquired by somebody else. And so they are buying their way out of the existing contract that we have. We have no control over whether somebody is being acquired by another institution. We do we do have a good track record of doing -- of saving those accounts by convincing the acquirer the switch to the Jack Henry system. Those are hard to do, and it's rare that you were able to do that because the acquirer is making all the decisions and the acquiree is having to respond to those decisions. But we have several times convinced the acquiring bank to convert to the Jack Henry system, but those are hard, and those are rare. So what drives deconversion revenue is one of our customers being acquired away. It's not that they're angry with Jack Henry and decide to leave us, and now they got to pay to get out of the agreement. It's 100% of the time, I'd say it's because they've been acquired by somebody else. So that really doesn't come into the retention rate conversation. And again, our retention rates are well into the upper 90s as far as the core base."

Continuing to do investment in the treasury platform because our larger banks that are serving larger commercial customers are continuing to look for additional functionality.

There's always ongoing investment in the core systems with new functionality and new look and feel. The user experience is constantly being updated. Our lending platform, I highlighted that a little while ago in this conversation, lots of ongoing investment there to expand the functionality to allow our customers, particularly on the commercial side, to do online lending. But we've also, in the past  year or so, in investing in new functionality for consumer lending and consumer deposits to deliver best-of-breed functionality when it comes to originating accounts online.

They've used it as a differentiator against banks and not just against big banks but against banks just in general. And part of their rationale has been that they have money to spend. On technology, they don't -- they haven't historically built as many branches that banks have. They've tried to use technology to be the differentiator.

On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. 
I will now turn the call over to Dave."
277617,712097144,2268350,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard",1486,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. 
For Q3 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $18 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts revenue in the current quarter negatively. But as I've highlighted many times in the past, this is good news for our company if you take a long-term view. 
Turning to the segments. We again had a good quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue decreased 4% for the quarter because of the reduction in deconversion fees, but increased by 3% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 1% increase in revenue this quarter and a 5% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
As I mentioned in the press release, our core sales teams had an extremely solid quarter and are now seeing core activity consistent with our pre-pandemic run rate. During the quarter, we inked 15 competitive core takeaways, which is greater than the 1 per week run rate we saw in 2019. 
In addition to our success signing new core clients, we signed 6 existing on-prem core customers to move to our private cloud environment. As we continue to push into the larger regional bank space, I think it's significant to note that of the 15 new core deals in the quarter, 5 were with multibillion-dollar asset banks and credit unions. 
As a reminder, regarding the topic of new core wins, at Jack Henry, we only call out new core deals when a banker credit union moves their entire core processing relationship from a competitor system to a Jack Henry core solution. We do not announce them as a new core win if they move from 1 Jack Henry core to another or if they simply purchase a new module from us. Think of it as a new logo on the Jack Henry core customer list that wasn't there previously. 
In addition to the tremendous success we saw with our core business this quarter, we continued to sign new clients to our new digital offerings. During the third quarter, we signed 42 new clients to our Banno platform, and we continue to see increased interest in this offering as well as the rest of our digital suite. 
In our April 6 press release regarding digital momentum, we shared that we had more than 400 financial institutions and more than 4.3 million users live on the Banno platform. As of May 1, however, we have added several more financial institutions, and we now have just over 5 million users live. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store, and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. As I've said before, I expect our success in this area to grow as we continue to add new functionality and features to the platform. 
Regarding the ongoing migrations of our new card processing platform, as of the end of March, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our debit processing customers to the new platform, in accordance with the plan we've been discussing for more than 3 years. Here are a few statistics regarding this remarkably successful project. 
We did our first migration on October 30, 2017, and completed the project on March 26, 2021. That's 1,243 days. During that time, we migrated 879 customers and added 151 new debit and credit customers to the platform. We currently support 1,030 banks and credit unions on the platform, and we're adding new clients every month. 
You will start to see the larger positive impact of this completed project on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter, as we have emphasized throughout the process. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. 
As you probably heard, M&A has become a topic again among bankers now that they're more confident about their operating models and the overall economy. Several of our clients have approached us recently to work with them as they prepare to complete acquisitions of smaller institutions. 
In fact, the CEOs of 2 regional banks currently processed by Jack Henry were quoted in an American Banker article last week regarding their desire to pick up where they left off before the pandemic brought everything to a halt. We expect our activity and what we refer to as the convert-merge area of our business to pick up again as we get into the summer months and new deals are announced. 
Speaking of American Banker, hopefully you all saw their article last month announcing that, once again, Jack Henry has been recognized by their team as a best place to work in fintech. American Banker only recognizes 50 companies each year. And as you can probably imagine, almost all of the companies on the fintech list generate less than $100 million in annual revenue, pretty much in keeping with the type of company most people think of when they hear the word fintech. 
We are particularly proud of this recognition for a few reasons: first, the scores are based on surveys conducted with our employees by an independent agency; second, this is our fifth year in a row to receive this designation from American Banker; third, we are many times larger than almost any other company on the list; and fourth, none of our larger competitors have ever made this list. I think this recognition is indicative of the culture, entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to developing truly innovative solutions found within the teams at Jack Henry. 
As you have undoubtedly already noted from yesterday's press release, we purchased a significant number of shares in the quarter. With a lack of good quality acquisitions for us to pursue and with our stock at an attractive price, we worked with the Board to authorize an additional repurchase under the existing plan, which enabled us to buy 1,825,000 shares during the quarter. 
This significant share repurchase does not foreshadow a change in our strategy in this regard. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to purchasing our own shares as we have excess cash and the lack of acquisition targets that fit our strategy. 
Hopefully, you've all seen the press release we posted this morning announcing the upcoming retirement of our long-time Chairman, Jack Prim. Of course, many of you know Jack is the guy who sat in this chair before I became CEO at Jack Henry. As I said in today's press release, Jack has given many years to our company as a business leader, a Board Member and a friend to us all. He has had a significant impact on the success of our company and on me personally. And for that, I want to sincerely thank him on behalf of all of us at Jack Henry. 
Recognizing that Jack has been considering a potential retirement for some time, we were prepared for his decision and expect our process to allow us to fill the vacancy close in time to Jack's retirement date. We hope to have more information to share regarding a new Board Member and a new Chairman before the end of June. 
Slowly but surely, our customers are settling into a new mode of operation with the anticipation of most COVID restrictions being lifted in the coming months. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote, but we are committed to our return to office date of July 1. 
We are finalizing plans for office usage and staffing that will employ a hybrid work-from-home, work-in-office strategy. And we will continue to leverage remote sales and implementation tools, where possible. We still have some work to do and some things to learn, but I'm very optimistic about our ability to be successful as the work environment shifts again post COVID. 
As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our virtual analyst conference next week. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."

For the quarter, our Services and Support revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting that Services and Support revenue for deconversion fees of $4.367 million in the c",1543,"Thanks, Dave. For the quarter, our Services and Support revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting that Services and Support revenue for deconversion fees of $4.367 million in the current quarter and deconversion fees of $22.8 million and revenue from divestitures last year in the prior fiscal quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, this revenue line would have grown actually 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year, which, obviously, as Dave mentioned, that has a lot of pressure and headwinds from our convert-merge revenue and also hardware in the quarter. 
Year-to-date, our deconversion fees are now down $33 million compared to the prior year, which, if you remember the guidance that we provided back in August, that is right in line with the full year impact. Services and support revenue primary driver was data processing and hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year. 
However, the growth in that line was totally offset by a decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which, again, was due to our decreased hardware implementation revenue for on-prem customers; convert-merge implementations, which is also down to the significant decrease in M&A activity; pass-through revenue that is related to billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations by the COVID; and then, obviously, deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which was down almost $18 million. 
Processing revenue increased 13% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and also increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage of growth of all revenue lines in both Q3 and year-to-date this year compared to the same periods last year. 
Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and was up 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Cost of revenue was up 4% compared to last year's second (sic) [ third ] quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at March 31 compared to a year ago. The increase in costs was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result of COVID travel limitations. 
Our research and development expense decreased 3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 over the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to a higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product development as we continue to invest in our products this quarter compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 6% in the second (sic) [ third ] quarter of fiscal '21 over the same quarter, and this decrease was primarily due to travel-related savings. 
Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased from 21.4% last year to 21% this year, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already pointed out and increased costs. However, on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased nicely, and we saw a strong margin expansion from 18.1% last year to 20.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. 
Our payments segment margins were impacted by deconversion fees in the quarter. But on a non-GAAP basis, our payments margin improved slightly with the completion of the platform migration. Both our core and complementary segments had a decrease in GAAP margins, but both of them had a nice increase in non-GAAP margins. So our underlying operations continue to be very strong as we move forward through the year. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was 21.5%, up from 19.7% in the same quarter a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in the timing of the release of respective reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from varying statute limitation periods. 
Our net income was $71.4 million in the third quarter compared to $73.9 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.95 for the current quarter compared to 96% -- $0.96 last year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 3% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed in service in the prior year. Included in this total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased $13.3 million -- or to $13.3 million this year compared to $15.4 million last year. 
Depreciation is up 3% due to the -- they're primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed in service. As Dave mentioned, we've purchased 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $384.4 million, and we paid dividends of just right at $100 million, for a total return to shareholders of $484.2 million year-to-date. 
Our operating cash flow was $266.3 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which is down a little from $276 million last year, which is also impacted by the significant decrease in deconversion fees this year-to-date compared to last year. We invested $116.7 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software year-to-date. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets, is $155.8 million year-to-date. 
A couple of comments on our balance sheet. Our cash position is $70.1 million compared to $109.5 million a year ago, so we still have decent cash for operations. We did draw down $200 million on our revolver during the quarter to fund our stock buybacks, but we have no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than operating leases. Our return on invested capital for our trailing 12 months is 19.2%, and our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 20.9%, which is very solid. 
For update on our guidance, we did update both our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for the full fiscal year. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. But if things do go differently, then obviously, this guidance will be revised. 
We've been very consistent with our GAAP guidance that revenue from deconversion fees would be a decrease of approximately $33 million compared to last year, which we hit that mark, as I previously said, during our fiscal Q3. And it now appears the deconversion revenue will actually be down by another $4 million in Q4 compared to the previous year, for a total decrease of approximately $37 million in deconversion fees compared to the last fiscal year. 
We continue to see no immediate M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which, in the short-term, will hurt -- will continue to hurt our revenue growth for the fiscal year. But in long term, as we have always said, that we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue for the long term. This means, based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we expect GAAP revenue to grow -- growth in FY '21 to be 3% to 3.5%. 
The adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY '21 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to the previous year and the small revenue impact from the Cruise divestiture during Q2 that was removed from FY '20 for comparison purposes. For non-GAAP revenue growth guidance provided in the release, we are now guiding to approximately 6% growth due to the ongoing headwinds previously discussed in the various lines of revenue. 
So we still anticipate we're going to grow 6% this year, which means Q4 is going to have a really nice revenue growth to get our slightly less than 5% year-to-date up to that 6% for the year. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY '21 to be down slightly at about 22% compared to last year, for all the reasons we discussed. And non-GAAP margins should actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year, similar to what we've seen through the first 3 quarters. 
Our effective tax rate for the full year of FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 rate at around 22%, assuming there are no federal or state tax law changes between now and the end of the year that would impact our fiscal year. We've also increased our full year EPS guidance for FY '21 again this quarter, which we provided last quarter a range of $3.85 to $3.90. We are now updating our EPS guidance for FY '21 to a range of $3.98 to $4.02. The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies, which is offsetting the impact of deconversion fees. 
With that, this concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Brandy, will you please open the call lines up for questions?"

Obviously, that's not going to all happen this quarter, and that's an annual run rate. We are in the process right now of decommissioning both those platforms. 
So there's -- all the cost savings is not going to be in this quarter. In fact, there's some other things that we're still having to do through the end of December, I believe, for some programming and different things to get the full efficiencies out of the new platforms. 
So it's probably going to be Q3 of next fiscal year that we have the full quarterly impact of that $16 million-plus savings, but we're going to start getting some this quarter. So you will see some payments margin expansion in Q4, and then you'll see more in Q1 and Q2 and then even more in Q3 next year."

I won't say that there's been any major shift in this quarter. And we started to see a shift in the -- earlier in the fiscal year for the heavy emphasis on digital and things that would allow our customers' customers, so whether it's a consumer or a commercial customer, allow them to conduct more business without coming into the branch. So the digital platform has, of course, been right at the front of that list. 
I'll reemphasize what I said in my opening comments here. In the press release we put out on April 6, we said we had around 400 institutions and 4.3 million users live. A month later, on May 4, we now have more than 5 million users live. So it really, I think, emphasizes the dramatic shift that's happening among banks and credit unions to ensure that their consumers and their commercial customers have best-of-breed digital technology for them to view. So that's been a key driver for our customers and certainly for us. 
Treasury is another piece of that puzzle. So I didn't call it out. And we have 12 so far this year as far as treasury, new customers that have signed to the treasury platform. Again, that's a move toward a more digital functionality, but for very large commercial customers. You don't install a treasury solution unless you have really large commercial customers. Otherwise, they just use cash management. So that, I think, is indicative. 
And then on the lending side, I've highlighted this many times, that's allowing a commercial customer to do complex commercial loans online without having to drive to the branch with their financial statements and all that packet of information. The thing that we have just recently done there is we've added this lending marketplace functionality, where customers, if they have a credit that's too large for them to book, they can essentially sell that credit through a marketplace to other lenders who want to take on the responsibility for that credit. 
So there's a lot of activity in all of those areas, but it is this shift toward doing business more in a digital environment as opposed to coming into the branch. That's what's driving all of those things that I just touched on."

We have really successfully shifted to enabling our sales team and customers being accepting of doing business remote. They still like to have people come in once a while and some customers insist on the sales rep coming in, but we're doing a lot of this remote. 
A lot of the demonstrations that we do now are -- normally, where we would have had 5 or 6 people on site, we'll, maybe we have 1 or 2 on site, and the other 4 are on a team's call or on a Zoom call doing the demonstration. So customers have really become to -- or gotten to the point where they'll accept that idea of much of this will be happening virtually. 
And so what that's created now is, and I think I've said this on calls before, we -- a good gauge for us of how stout our sales pipeline is, is if we are at about 90% of our annual quota, so not a monthly quota, but the annual quota. At any given time on any given day, if we have about 90% of the annual quota in the pipeline, then we know that we've got enough happening, that we should be able to make our number. We are right at that mark right now. 
And so what that tells me is customers are engaging with us. They have salespeople working with them on deals. And we were kind of back to a normal run rate that we would have seen in 2019, that's what we're seeing today in the sales pipeline. So the number of engagements and the volume of deals that are flowing through the pipe are about where we were in 2019."

And now we can focus wholly on adding new customers instead of migrating all of our existing customers because that was such a major feat to get that done without disrupting our customers, I mean, that alone should help drive some nice payment growth. Our remote deposit capture -- I know check conversion is not sexy, but it just continues to be a major grower for us. 
And then as we get back to the new core wins that we've seen and the migrations from end out, yes, I see no reason why our revenue growth in the next fiscal year can't be up nicely from where it was this year."

But what we are seeing today, as I quoted in my comments, we are back to the run rate that we saw in 2019. And I talked about it many times on the calls at the time that we were on this run rate of booking 1 competitive takeaway per week. 
Can I say with absolute certainty that we're going to do 52 deals next year? No. But it's certainly the pace right now. And everything that we'll see in the pipeline for the next coming months, the pace is definitely greater than it has been during COVID-19, during the depths of COVID-19, I guess, I'll put it that way. And it's logical. I don't think anybody should be surprised that there was a slowdown in those core decisions during the pandemic. 
Because, as we've talked about before, when you're the CEO of a bank or credit union, you decide to switch out your core, that's essentially making a decision to do heart-and-lung transplant all at the same time for your institution. And it's a very disruptive -- no matter how smooth it goes, it's a disruptive process. And why would you make that decision unless you absolutely have to? Why would you make that decision in the midst of a global pandemic? 
And so I think it's totally logical that we're back to that pace. All -- if you take COVID out of the picture, all the other reasons for a customer to move to Jack Henry, those are all there still, just like they were in 2019. And so I think these bank and credit union executives are seeing that now. They know how to manage through in the COVID world, and now they're back to thinking about, ""How do I find a best-of-breed provider on the core side? Then let's go talk to Jack Henry."""

I mean, I said earlier that our non-GAAP is going to finish up pretty much in line, it's slightly up from where it was last year. It's -- we will gain more than 100 bps in operating margin in FY '22. And could it be more than that? Yes. But I think, as I said earlier, it's going to take us some additional time. As Dave just said, it's going to take some time to take out all these costs taken out. 
And it's actually going to be by the end of the second quarter, I believe, when we get all the costs taken out. So you're going to see some continued margin improvement throughout next fiscal year, and it will be Q3 when you see the full impact of what the cost takeout from the payment migration. But as we continue to add new payments customers, as we continue to add new core customers, as we continue to migrate our on-prem customers to our private cloud, all those things will help our margins. 
The other thing that I think a lot of people forget about is, with the M&A activity, obviously, our deconversion fees are down. But on the other side, that is, in our -- both our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers is what -- and Dave alluded to in his opening comments, is our convert-merge revenue because our customers do a lot of acquiring as well. So we've had some significant headwinds this fiscal year on our convert-merge revenue, we have done no risks or layoffs, so we still have all the costs. 
So just having some -- the M&A activity picking up will not only give us back some deconversion fee revenue, which we really don't want, that will also help with convert-merge revenue, which -- that will also help our operating margins. So there's so many positive things that's going to help our operating margins as these things get back to normal. Dave?"

Customer response has been terrific. Our customers are much happier. They're definitely referenceable, which is what's leading to all of these successes in signing new customers to the platform. So it really has been the right move for Jack Henry. It was a long-term project, and there was pain along the way because you're disrupting all these customers, but it really was the right decision. It's been a good move for us, for our customers. And so we're well positioned for growth in the future. 
And the one thing I'll emphasize that we've talked about on previous calls, haven't talked about it in a while, but our old platform was dependent on a Jack Henry core system for those -- for the old platforms to function.

And so once we have Banno consumer and Banno business all up and running and live and good to go, then we start selling outside the Jack Henry core base.

It is a key part of our strategy. We have continued to add functionality over the years, and we are winning in that space regularly, just as I emphasized on the call today. 
So we have -- we are not the little brother in the multibillion-dollar banking space. We are definitely a player. But the question for us is, historically, we have been below about $50 billion. And so one of the things that Stacey will talk about at the Analyst Day next week is that we are -- we do have an initiative to move above $50 billion because that has not been a market that we've been in historically. We've been below $50 billion, but we have teams, and we've been actively working in that space as well. 
So we definitely are not targeting smaller banks. In fact, if you're a credit union below about $100 million in assets or a bank below about $200 million in assets, Jack Henry, generally, is not the fit. We're the fit for a -- right around $1 billion is a real sweet spot for us. But as I mentioned, we've continued to grow upmarket here for many years."

I'm concerned that you may have just a little bit of a misconception about deconversion fees. So when we get deconversion fees, that's because one of our customers has been acquired by somebody else. And so they are buying their way out of the existing contract that we have. 
We have no control over whether somebody is being acquired by another institution. We do have a good track record of doing -- of saving those accounts by convincing the acquirer to switch to the Jack Henry system. Those are hard to do, and it's rare that you are able to do that because the acquirer is making all the decisions, and the acquiree is having to respond to those decisions. But we have, several times, convinced the acquiring bank to convert to the Jack Henry system. But those are hard, and those are rare. 
So what drives deconversion revenue is one of our customers being acquired away. It's not that they're angry with Jack Henry and decide to leave us, and now they got to pay to get out of the agreement. It's -- 100% of the time, I'd say it's because they've been acquired by somebody else. So that really doesn't come into the retention rate conversation. And again, our retention rates are well into the upper 90s as far as the core base."

So talking of those solutions, some of them we've talked about here. We have digital is on that list, continuing to do a lot of investment in digital. Continuing to do investment in the treasury platform because our larger banks that are serving larger commercial customers are continuing to look for additional functionality. So that's on the list as far as R&D projects is concerned. 
We have our -- the core systems, we're continuing to do investment. That's something that you never say you're done. There's always ongoing investment in the core systems with new functionality and new look and feel. The user experience is constantly being updated. 
Our lending platform, so I highlighted that a little while ago in this conversation, lots of ongoing investment there to expand the functionality, to allow our customers, particularly on the commercial side, to do online lending. But we've also, in the past year or so, been investing in new functionality for consumer lending and consumer deposits, to deliver best-of-breed functionality when it comes to originating accounts online. 
And then the last I'd highlight is in the area of fraud. So a lot of investment going on in the fraud area, where new functionality to deliver a more digital experience, I guess, around managing fraud for our customers."

Credit unions have always put technology at the front of the line. They've used it as a differentiator against banks, and not just against big banks, but against banks just in general. And part of their rationale has been that they have money to spend on technology. 
They don't -- they haven't historically built as many branches that banks have. They've tried to use technology to be the differentiator.

Today, we are very pleased to share details with you of a quarter that produced record revenue and operating income as well as record sales bookings.
As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business while dealing with the ongoing effects of the pandemic.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 10% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 4% for the quarter and increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payment segment performed extremely well, posting a 16% increase in revenue this quarter and a 17% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.
As I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company. June was also the strongest sales month ever, and have propelled all 3 sales groups to exceed their quota for the quarter. While they were signing all those contracts in the fourth quarter, the sales team also did an outstanding job of refilling the pipeline with new opportunities to set us up for success going forward. I think this is a good sign of the health of our market, and bodes well for the start of the new sales year.
In the fourth fiscal quarter, we booked 13 competitive core takeaways and 14 deals to move existing on-premise customers to our private cloud environment. Several of our complementary offerings also saw a very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 87 new clients to our Banno digital platform in the quarter, 10 new treasury management clients and 22 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 41 competitive core takeaways, with 8 of them greater than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 35 contracts to move on-prem core clients to our private cloud, 219 new Banno Digital customers and 55 new clients for our card processing solution. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions.
At our analyst conference in May, I shared with the attendees that we had just surpassed 5 million registered users on our Banno Digital Banking platform. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were at roughly 5.6 million registered users. As a point of reference, on July 1, 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users. So in 1 year, we saw an increase of approximately 75% in our user count. This is significant because, as I have stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform. We continue to onboard clients and their users at a pace of about 30 financial institutions added to the platform each month.
In addition to our ongoing success with Banno, we have delivered many new and innovative solutions during the fiscal year. A few examples include our Symitar team delivered an automated database migration to almost all of our Episys clients, which allowed them to move to the new database structure with no effort or client impact. Our lending team delivered the Jack Henry Loan Marketplace, which allows banks and credit unions to easily engage through a digital experience in the buying, selling and participation of loans.
Our digital team delivered the Banno Digital Toolkit, which provides a complete set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, to enable easy plug-ins to third-party solutions in our digital platform. Our payments team continued the expansion of functionality and adoption of the PayCenter platform and delivered the Zelle digital tool to enable clients not using our digital platform to connect to the PayCenter hub for Zelle transactions. And of course, the payments group completed the 3.5-year project to upgrade our card payments platform. Almost all of these new deliverables are built on entirely new technology stacks and are designed to make easier for our customers to leverage our open architecture tools and philosophy to deliver cutting-edge solutions to their account holders.
As you may know, we have a number of active projects at Jack Henry centered on the topic of corporate responsibility. We continue to advance our environmental stewardship commitment and recently announced that on Earth Day, our associates launched a new business innovation group called Bill Green. Our business innovation groups are company-sponsored associate-driven groups that provide a collaborative platform for people, ideas and thoughts to intersect and help address business challenges. Our associates decided that a business innovation group focused on our planet was appropriate and necessary for us to make meaningful progress on this initiative.
As the labor market continues to heat up, we are focused more than ever on attracting and retaining talented associates. To that end, we have recently implemented new technology to expand our remote recruiting efforts and broaden our pool of qualified and diverse talent. Our hope is that this approach will only serve to improve on the reputation as a great place to work that we currently enjoy in cities across the country. Our consistent placement on Best Places to Work list is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry, and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture. I'm pleased to share that nearly 2/3 of our associates participated in our most recent engagement survey, and our average engagement score was 83%, well above the industry benchmark.
Like most employers, we have spent a good bit of time in the past few weeks wrestling with decisions around the right timing and approach to move employees back to work in our company facilities. We worked with our leadership teams earlier in the calendar year and determined that more than half of our workforce would continue to work remote indefinitely. We had targeted July 1 as our return to office date for those who would be earning in a full-time or hybrid basis. As the Delta variants surged, we reverted to our previous operating model with only essential employees in our offices every day. We have proven that we can operate effectively in a remote posture, and we will continue in that mode until we determine it is safe to make a change.
As I referenced on the last earnings call, our longtime Chairman, Jack Prim, has retired as of the end of June. Jack had been with our company for many years in various leadership roles and as a Board member and Chairman. As a result of Jack's retirement, we have announced 2 changes to the Board. Curtis Campbell has joined the Board effective July 1 to fill the seat left vacant by Jack's departure. Curtis is President of Software for Blucora in Dallas. He brings extensive experience in infrastructure and cloud computing as well as digital development and a keen focus on customer experience. I'm very excited to see what new perspectives Curtis brings to our Board discussions. 
Also effective July 1, I was elected to be the new Board Chair. I was humbled and honored by the confidence expressed by the other Board members, and I look forward to leading the Jack Henry Board to even greater success.
As I reflect back on fiscal 2021, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement scores remained very high, and we've made great strides with our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. We have successfully completed several leadership and Board level retirements and replacements. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year of selling. And overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains high in all segments of our business.
We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers and shareholders. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about the future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."
277617,1676142692,2381419,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2021",2021-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Our services and support revenue -- line of revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees for the quarter were pretty flat with last year's fourth",1388,"Thanks, Dave. Our services and support revenue -- line of revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees for the quarter were pretty flat with last year's fourth quarter. However, for the full year, our deconversion fees were down $33.3 million for the full fiscal year compared to the prior year, which is actually the guidance that we provided a year ago on this call. Our service support revenue primary driver was our data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud and public cloud offerings, which continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 7% for the quarter.
However, the growth in this line is slowed significantly due to product delivery and service revenue, which includes deconversion fees, license, hardware, implementation and convert merge revenue, which only grew 2% compared to the prior year quarter, which this line is obviously somewhat impacted by COVID. Our processing revenue increased 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by our higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card and credit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to grow -- show very strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong, as Dave highlighted.
Our total revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to last year, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. So excluding deconversion fees and divestitures, our non-GAAP grew 10% as well. For the full fiscal year, revenue was up 4% on a GAAP basis and 6% on a non-GAAP basis, again, excluding deconversion fees and revenues from divestitures.
Our cost of revenue was up 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The increase primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing and higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Our research and development expense decreased 4% for the quarter of fiscal '21 over the prior year quarter. The decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago.
Our SG&A expense increased 3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. The increase is due primarily to increased personnel and professional services costs. Our reported consolidated operating margins increased nicely from 18.7% last year to 21.4% in the current year quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 17.8% last year to 20.1% this year.
Our Payments segment saw the nicest margin expansion in the quarter. After completing the payment platform migration in Q3, margins grew from 43% last year to 45% this year on the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis, our payments segment margins grew from 42.3 to 44.5, so over 200 bps margin expansion. Our core segment operating margins decreased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while our company segment margins increased slightly on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was down slightly to 19.7% compared to 20% in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to some tax -- state tax deductibility timing. Our net income grew 25% to $76.9 million for the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $61.3 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.04 for the current quarter compared to $0.80 last year or a $0.24 or 30% increase over the prior year.
Our cash flow total amortization increased 3% for the fiscal year compared to last year, primarily due to capitalized projects being placed into service last year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $17.7 million this fiscal year compared to $20.3 million last fiscal year. Depreciation was up slightly at less than 1% for the year compared to the prior fiscal year.
During the year, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our [indiscernible] stock to the treasury for $431.5 million, and we paid dividends of $133.8 million for a total return to shareholders of $565.3 million for the year. Our operating cash flow was $462.1 million for the year, which was down from $510.5 million last fiscal year, which this decrease was primarily due to the timing of various operating assets and liabilities and timing. We invested $157.8 million back intercompany through CapEx and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx, less cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets, was $310.5 million for the year, which represents a 99.7% net income to free cash flow conversion.
Yesterday's press release inadvertently omitted the proceeds from dispositions line of net cash from investing activities within the cash flow summary. Amounts that should have been included were cash inflows of $6,187 million in fiscal '21 and $11,130 million for fiscal 2020. The totals for investing activities were correct. This omission was corrected in the version of the earnings press release filed yesterday on Form 8-K and the one notated on our website.
Couple of comments on our balance sheet. Our cash position of $51 million compared to $213 million a year ago, primarily down due to the significant stock repurchase we did. You'll remember at the end of Q3, we had $200 million drawn down on our revolver. During Q4, we paid down $100 million of that balance. So at June 30, we had $100 million on our revolver. We had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than operating leases.
For the year, our return on average assets for the fiscal year was 13.1%. Our return on invested capital for the fiscal year was 21%, and our return on equity for the year was 21.7%. Yesterday, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release for fiscal 2022. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue guidance in the release following the segment information in the press release.
Just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve, but if things work differently than this, then guidance will be revised. For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22, based on the amounts of the release yesterday, our revenue guidance is a range of 8.2% to 8.7% growth over fiscal '21, due to higher anticipated deconversion fees compared to FY '21. And for non-GAAP revenue growth, we are guiding to an initial range of 7.5% to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year on future earnings calls.
We do anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have nice margin expansion in our payment segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees. I am somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an improvement in operating margin as we will continue to have headwinds on license revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-prem to our private cloud. Also, travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the last year. And at this time, we are still planning to host our Jack Henry Annual Conference and our Symitar EGI Conference in person this year. Therefore, there will be some large cost returning this year compared to last year when there was very little travel. However, we do think that we will get at least 50 bps of margin expansion in the fiscal year.
Our effective tax rate for FY '22 is projected to be slightly higher at approximately 22.5% to 23% compared to our actual rate this year of 21.7%, and this is primarily due to the significant impact from equity awards that were deductible in FY '21. Our initial FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $453 million to $460 million, which is a 10%-plus increase from our FY '21 finish.
This concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Liz, will you please open the lines up for questions."

We don't -- you know this well, we don't publish a TCV number or anything like that. But it's -- that's a good way to think about how we measure quota and how quotas are assigned. So you can you can kind of use that logic in making some assumptions. So if we're 7% or 8%-ish increase over the prior year as far as sales performance, that's a good way to think about it.
Now the other thing I'll point out is when we assign quotas for next year, meaning for the year we're in now, fiscal '22, we -- our starting point is last year's performance, and then we normally apply somewhere between 3% and 5% quota increase over the top of what the performance was last year. So that's where the sales team is starting out this year is with a sales quota that is somewhere in the 3% to 5% range larger than it was their actual payment for the prior year."

That's a very intuitive question, Dave. In fact, I'm presenting at a conference in, I think it's February of next year on that very topic because bankers are starting to realize that if you have a good digital platform on the front end, and if you take advantage of an open infrastructure like we have at Jack Henry, and it's the reason we talk about it all the time, you can do, as a banker, essentially all those same things and draw customers to your platform as a bank with the FDIC insurance backing it. And there's a real opportunity for bankers to take advantage of this desire and demand among consumers today for solutions like that.
So we are doing that today with a number of banks, but part of the channel or part of the process for me is to educate bankers on what they can do, what they should be thinking about, how they compete in those areas. So lots of opportunity for our customers and for Jack Henry, but it's based on a really outstanding digital platform and then having all the connectivity to connect those types of fintech functions into that digital platform. And we have all of those things in production today at Jack Henry.
This isn't a wish for the future, this is in production today with customers today. So a great opportunity. And to the first part of your question about customer growth. So yes, we are able to measure customer growth, whether it's members on the credit union platform or customers on the banking platforms. And not only are we adding customers because we're winning share, we're winning new customers. So the net number of customers we serve is greater. But because there is same-store sales growth happening, particularly on the credit side of the business, it's happening on the banking side, but it's been strong on the credit union side of the business as well."

That business has been growing nicely as well. So it's a much smaller piece of the segment that's growing rapidly.

So both of those, too, and I've said it on many earnings calls, the bill pay business, relatively flat for everybody. There's not a whole lot of new stuff happening in traditional bill pay. But the card growth that you've seen, I think under -- or in the high single digit is a good expectation for the card growth, but it will be greater than that for the EPS business as far as what we're seeing right now because of the strength of that platform."

And I think those got completely decommissioned, I believe, by mid-July, if I remember right.
But there are some other things that's going on here, Kartik. So there were some other tools that we have to keep the talent on to rewrite and get some additional tools in place, which that will be done by the end of Q2. And so you'll see some additional costs coming out by then. So by Q3 of this year, we will see the full benefit of the cost takeout that we guided to 3 years ago."

As a percentage of total revenue, on the top of my head, John, I can't -- I mean it's not a huge number, but when you start talking several million dollars in convert merge revenue that we basically build full boat for those, so it's a very nice margin business. It's probably -- it's actually the highest implementation margins we have. So not only does it help reduce the headwinds on revenue, but it also helps our overall operating margin."

But to answer the specifics of your question, no, this is not just a few large clients or something like that. This is a broad suite of solutions that we've been selling to a broad list of customers. Of course, the core success that we've had this year was significant. And so that's a driver. 
I highlighted in my opening comments, the number of Banno customers that we signed this year. So 219 brand-new Banno digital customers. That is becoming an important driver for us as we go forward. But then it's all these other solutions, to treasury management and all the customers that we signed for payments platforms, including, like I mentioned in my response to Dave Koning's question earlier, our EPS platform, which we're seeing some nice interest in that as a payments platform for customers going forward.
So it's just a broad variety of solutions. So the point about pent-up demand, and that's a little bit of a tough one because we saw -- sales was lumpier during the height of COVID. But we didn't see -- when you look at it over the 12-month period, we didn't see sales slow down, but it was very lumpy.
So I have trouble characterizing it as pent-up demand because the sales happened, they were just not quite a smooth we're normally accustomed to. So I think it's interest in Jack Henry. It's customers coming to Jack Henry, who just haven't done business with us before, and it's because of this broad suite of solutions that we have and all of the new technology that we delivered.
So I highlighted in my opening comments, the work that our Symitar team did around database migration and delivering an entirely new database, the lending team with all the new functionality that we've delivered there this year, the digital team that I've already highlighted, the payments -- PayCenter platform that I talked about in my opening comments, where we now enable all these real-time payments through a brand-new ground-up payments platform.

When you talk about the revenue margin guidance being conservative, can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes of that commentary? And you went over this a little bit. But when you think about beating the 50 basis points margin expansion, does that really coincide with you beating your revenue guidance? And perhaps what kind of investments do you think you could look -- you could see where even if you beat on the revenue guidance, there's some additional investments you'd like to make that might just keep you around that 50 basis points overall for margin expansion for the year?"

So to beat the guidance we gave for non-GAAP revenue, it would mean that we would have some continued implementation of movements from some of our card customers, so move some large debit customers over the continued success in our credit card platform processing. M&A activity, which would drive the convert merge revenue and billable travel that we talked about earlier, and then just implementing. And then obviously, the continued movement of moving our on-prem customers into our private cloud also helps our margins.
So there's several different drivers that could cause us to beat that non-GAAP revenue guidance. And from what I'm seeing, I think that's probably going to happen, but I'm not willing to step down that limit and say how much at this point. And every one of those things that I just mentioned can also help to improve margin.
As far as investments, I mean we just finished our budget. And I don't know that -- even if we beat revenue guidance, I don't know that there's any big investments out there that we need to make that we're not already making either from a cap software development or from CapEx that's not already in the budget, which is part of that guidance."

So it's not this calendar year, it will be next year. This year, the major deliverable for the Banno group is Banno business, which is the -- if you think about all the functionality we have on the consumer side with Banno, in a couple of months here, we'll deliver all that same type functionality on the business side of the solution. And then it will be next calendar year that we'll start delivering outside the base.
But as I've stressed on these calls in the past, most banks and credit unions in the United States, I'm not just talking about Jack Henry core customers, I'm talking in general, most of them have an Internet banking offering and a mobile banking offering, and they are 2 different things, 2 different experiences. Consumers don't want 2 different experiences anymore. They expect to have a single experience when they go to access their information from their financial institution, and it doesn't matter what the form factor is. If they're on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC, they expect to have the same experience.
And so that creates opportunity for us inside and outside our base. And so -- and that's not changing anytime soon. There are thousands of institutions out there who will, over the next several years, upgrade their digital experience, and we plan to be there with Banno outside the base next year.
As far as the size of the business, we don't call that out as a separate business. We have we have discussed at some point, would we possibly do that as a segment, but we're not there yet. But it's -- the 5.6 million users I've been asked on these calls before, there are some pure play offerings out there that you can kind of do the math and figure out, based on their number of users, what the revenue per user is.
Is that transferable to Jack Henry? My answer is generally yes, that's transferable. So you can kind of figure out how large the business is. The thing that I will stress is for that business, our digital business operates under the same rules as our other businesses at Jack Henry, which means you don't get a pass on making money, you have to produce operating income, operating results in addition to revenue growth. And certainly, the Banno business is doing that for Jack Henry.
So it's continuing to grow nicely. We'll continue to grow nicely based on all the things we're seeing right now, the backlog of installs that we have right now. And we'll continue to produce operating -- bottom line operating results for our company."

So I'm happy with that model. I don't expect that we're going to see some great big pop in sales in the coming year. I think the performance will continue to be solid and consistent."

So first off, we have about 300 different solutions. And so they are all in some stage of either fully platformed on a complete open platform or they're in the process or some is done.
And there are some that it isn't logical to take them to an open -- to a new architecture. We, for example, have a payroll solution that it's been around for a long time. It was a successful product. Nobody is buying payroll solutions from a provider like us anymore. We haven't sold a copy in 20 years. Why we put the effort into replatforming that product? 
So if you look at the broad suite of solutions that we offer, it isn't logical to try and move everything to a new platform. But for all those that are the real high demand solutions, they've either been put into a completely open environment or they're in process of offering that type of solution. And many have been important to public cloud offerings. So we're in both Azure and AWS today with some of our solutions. We have many in our private cloud. So it's just because of the broad suite of products that we have, it's just kind of naturally a variety of different platforms that we offer them on. But for the kind of the key solutions, they either are today supporting open connectivity, open infrastructure or we're well on our way to doing that.
I'll let you take the hard part, Kevin."

So our total R&D spend has grown at almost the exact same pace as our top line revenue for the last 10 years. I don't see that changing. I think we're going to continue that. And I would tell you that the way -- we don't do really big bang productions.
I mean we do sprints and do try to get modules rolled out as quick as possible and do additional modules. So there's no -- not going to see any huge increase in amortization of software in any given year. It's just going to kind of slowly grow because at any given time, this is actually a chart I show the Board every quarter. At any given time about 85% or 86% of our total cap software on the balance sheet is in production being amortized.
So -- and that hasn't changed for the last -- last few years either. So what that tells you is we're continuing to develop all that software. We continue to roll it out. But at the same time, in 5 years, some of the stuff the amortization has done amortizing. So you got an offset there. So I don't think that we're going to do anything crazy in the foreseeable future. it's going to have much of an impact on either cash flow or the P&L other than what you've seen in the last few years."

As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associ",1492,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are very pleased to share details with you of a quarter that produced record revenue and operating income as well as record sales bookings. 
As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business while dealing with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 10% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 4% for the quarter and increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payment segment performed extremely well, posting a 16% increase in revenue this quarter and a 17% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
As I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company. June was also the strongest sales month ever, and have propelled all 3 sales groups to exceed their quota for the quarter. While they were signing all those contracts in the fourth quarter, the sales team also did an outstanding job of refilling the pipeline with new opportunities to set us up for success going forward. I think this is a good sign of the health of our market, and bodes well for the start of the new sales year. 
In the fourth fiscal quarter, we booked 13 competitive core takeaways and 14 deals to move existing on-premise customers to our private cloud environment. Several of our complementary offerings also saw a very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 87 new clients to our Banno digital platform in the quarter, 10 new treasury management clients and 22 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 41 competitive core takeaways, with 8 of them greater than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 35 contracts to move on-prem core clients to our private cloud, 219 new Banno digital customers and 55 new clients for our card processing solution. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions. 
At our analyst conference in May, I shared with the attendees that we had just surpassed 5 million registered users on our Banno Digital Banking platform. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were at roughly 5.6 million registered users. As a point of reference, on July 1, 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users. So in 1 year, we saw an increase of approximately 75% in our user count. This is significant because, as I have stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform. We continue to onboard clients and their users at a pace of about 30 financial institutions added to the platform each month. 
In addition to our ongoing success with Banno, we have delivered many new and innovative solutions during the fiscal year. A few examples include our Symitar team delivered an automated database migration to almost all of our Episys clients, which allowed them to move to the new database structure with no effort or client impact. Our lending team delivered the Jack Henry Loan Marketplace, which allows banks and credit unions to easily engage through a digital experience in the buying, selling and participation of loans. Our digital team delivered the Banno Digital Toolkit, which provides a complete set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, to enable easy plug-ins to third-party solutions in our digital platform. Our payments team continued the expansion of functionality and adoption of the PayCenter platform and delivered the Zelle digital tool to enable clients not using our digital platform to connect to the PayCenter hub for Zelle transactions. And of course, the payments group completed the 3.5-year project to upgrade our card payments platform. Almost all of these new deliverables are built on entirely new technology stacks and are designed to make it easier for our customers to leverage our open architecture tools and philosophy to deliver cutting-edge solutions to their account holders. 
As you may know, we have a number of active projects at Jack Henry centered on the topic of corporate responsibility. We continue to advance our environmental stewardship commitment and recently announced that on Earth Day, our associates launched a new business innovation group called Bill Green. Our business innovation groups are company-sponsored, associate-driven groups that provide a collaborative platform for people, ideas and thoughts to intersect and help address business challenges. Our associates decided that a business innovation group focused on our planet was appropriate and necessary for us to make meaningful progress on this initiative. 
As the labor market continues to heat up, we are focused more than ever on attracting and retaining talented associates. To that end, we have recently implemented new technology to expand our remote recruiting efforts and broaden our pool of qualified and diverse talent. Our hope is that this approach will only serve to improve on the reputation as a great place to work that we currently enjoy in cities across the country. Our consistent placement on Best Places to Work list is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry, and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture. I'm pleased to share that nearly 2/3 of our associates participated in our most recent engagement survey, and our average engagement score was 83%, well above the industry benchmark. 
Like most employers, we have spent a good bit of time in the past few weeks wrestling with decisions around the right timing and approach to move employees back to work in our company facilities. We worked with our leadership teams earlier in the calendar year and determined that more than half of our workforce would continue to work remote indefinitely. We had targeted July 1 as our return to office date for those who would be earning in a full-time or hybrid basis. As the Delta variants surged, we reverted to our previous operating model with only essential employees in our offices every day. 
We have proven that we can operate effectively in a remote posture, and we will continue in that mode until we determine it is safe to make a change. As I referenced on the last earnings call, our longtime Chairman, Jack Prim, has retired as of the end of June. Jack had been with our company for many years in various leadership roles and as a Board member and Chairman. As a result of Jack's retirement, we have announced 2 changes to the Board. Curtis Campbell has joined the Board effective July 1 to fill the seat left vacant by Jack's departure. Curtis is President of Software for Blucora in Dallas. He brings extensive experience in infrastructure and cloud computing as well as digital development and a keen focus on customer experience. I'm very excited to see what new perspectives Curtis brings to our Board discussions.  
Also effective July 1, I was elected to be the new Board Chair. I was humbled and honored by the confidence expressed by the other Board members, and I look forward to leading the Jack Henry Board to even greater success. As I reflect back on fiscal 2021, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement scores remained very high, and we've made great strides with our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. We have successfully completed several leadership and Board level retirements and replacements. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year of selling. And overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains high in all segments of our business. 
We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers and shareholders. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."

Our services and support revenue -- line of revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees for the quarter were pretty flat with last year's fourth quarter. However, for the full year, our deconversion fees were down $33.3 million for the full fiscal year compared to the prior year, which is actually the guidance that we provided a year ago on this call. Our service support revenue primary driver was our data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud and public cloud offerings, which continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 7% for the quarter. 
However, the growth in this line is slowed significantly due to product delivery and service revenue, which includes deconversion fees, license, hardware, implementation and convert merge revenue, which only grew 2% compared to the prior year quarter, which this line is obviously somewhat impacted by COVID. Our processing revenue increased 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by our higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card and credit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to grow -- show very strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong, as Dave highlighted. 
Our total revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to last year, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. So excluding deconversion fees and divestitures, our non-GAAP grew 10% as well. For the full fiscal year, revenue was up 4% on a GAAP basis and 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, excluding deconversion fees and revenues from divestitures. 
Our cost to revenue was up 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing and higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Our research and development expense decreased 4% for the quarter of fiscal '21 over the prior year quarter. The decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago. 
Our SG&A expense increased 3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. The increase is due primarily to increased personnel and professional services costs. Our reported consolidated operating margins increased nicely from 18.7% last year to 21.4% in the current year quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 17.8% last year to 20.1% this year. 
Our Payments segment saw the nicest margin expansion in the quarter. After completing the payment platform migration in Q3, margins grew from 43% last year to 45% this year on the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis. And on a non-GAAP basis, our payments segment margins grew from 42.3 to 44.5, so over 200 bps margin expansion. Our core segment operating margins decreased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while our company segment margins increased slightly on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was down slightly to 19.7% compared to 20% in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to some tax -- state tax deductibility timing. Our net income grew 25% to $76.9 million for the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $61.3 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.04 for the current quarter compared to $0.80 last year or a $0.24 or 30% increase over the prior year. 
Our cash flow total amortization increased 3% for the fiscal year compared to last year, primarily due to capitalized projects being placed into service last year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $17.7 million this fiscal year compared to $20.3 million last fiscal year. Depreciation was up slightly at less than 1% for the year compared to the prior fiscal year. 
During the year, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our [indiscernible] stock to the treasury for $431.5 million, and we paid dividends of $133.8 million for a total return to shareholders of $565.3 million for the year. Our operating cash flow was $462.1 million for the year, which was down from $510.5 million last fiscal year, which this decrease was primarily due to the timing of various operating assets and liabilities and timing. We invested $157.8 million back intercompany through CapEx and capitalized software. 
Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx, less cap software, and adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets, was $310.5 million for the year, which represents a 99.7% net income for free cash flow conversion. Yesterday's press release inadvertently omitted the proceeds from dispositions line of net cash from investing activities within the cash flow summary. Amounts that should have been included were cash inflows of $6.187 million in fiscal '21 and $11,130 million for fiscal 2020. The totals for investing activities were correct. This omission was corrected in the version of the earnings press release filed yesterday on Form 8-K and the one notated on our website. 
Couple of comments on our balance sheet. Our cash position of $51 million compared to $213 million a year ago, primarily down due to the significant stock repurchase we did. You'll remember at the end of Q3, we had $200 million drawn down on our revolver. During Q4, we paid down $100 million of that balance. So at June 30, we had $100 million on our revolver. We had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than operating leases. 
For the year, our return on average assets for the fiscal year was 13.1%. Our return on invested capital for the fiscal year was 21%, and our return on equity for the year was 21.7%. Yesterday, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release for fiscal 2022. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue guidance in the release following the segment information in the press release. 
Just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve, but if things work differently than this, then guidance will be revised. For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22, based on the amounts of the release yesterday, our revenue guidance is a range of 8.2% to 8.7% growth over fiscal '21, due to higher anticipated deconversion fees compared to FY '21. And for non-GAAP revenue growth, we are guiding to an initial range of 7.5% to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year on future earnings calls. 
We do anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have nice margin expansion in our payment segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees. I am somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an improvement in operating margin as we will continue to have headwinds on license revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-prem to our private cloud. Also, travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the last year. 
And at this time, we are still planning to host our Jack Henry Annual Conference and our Symitar EGI Conference in person this year. Therefore, there will be some large cost returning this year compared to last year, when there was very little travel. However, we do think that we will get at least 50 bps of margin expansion in the fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '22 is projected to be slightly higher at approximately 22.5% to 23% compared to our actual rate this year of 21.7%. And this is primarily due to the significant impact from equity awards that were deductible in FY '21. Our initial FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $453 million to $460 million, which is a 10%-plus increase from our FY '21 finish. 
This concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Liz, will you please open the lines up for questions."

I know with the core segment, do you expect sort of this improvement that we've seen on a non-GAAP basis to kind of continue into next year? And then payment segment has already been quite strong. I mean is there room for further acceleration as some of the new wins on the card payment side start to flow in?"

We don't -- you know this well, we don't publish a TCV number or anything like that. But it's -- that's a good way to think about how we measure quota and how quotas are assigned. So you can  kind of use that logic in making some assumptions. So if we're 7% or 8%-ish increase over the prior year as far as sales performance, that's a good way to think about it. Now the other thing I'll point out is when we assign quotas for next year, meaning for the year we're in now, fiscal '22, we -- our starting point is last year's performance. And then we normally apply somewhere between 3% and 5% quota increase over the top of what the performance was last year. So that's where the sales team is starting out this year, is with a sales quota that is somewhere in the 3% to 5% range, larger than it was their actual payment for the prior year."

That's a very intuitive question, Dave. In fact, I'm presenting at a conference in, I think it's February of next year on that very topic because bankers are starting to realize that if you have a good digital platform on the front end, and if you take advantage of an open infrastructure like we have at Jack Henry, and it's the reason we talk about it all the time, you can do, as a banker, essentially all those same things and draw our customers to your platform as a bank with the FDIC insurance backing it. And there's a real opportunity for bankers to take advantage of this desire and demand among consumers today for solutions like that.
So we are doing that today with a number of banks, but part of the channel or part of the process for me is to educate bankers on what they can do, what they should be thinking about, how they compete in those areas. So lots of opportunity for our customers and for Jack Henry, but it's based on a really outstanding digital platform and then having all the connectivity to connect those types of fintech functions into that digital platform. And we have all of those things in production today at Jack Henry.
This isn't a wish for the future, this is in production today with customers today. So a great opportunity. And to the first part of your question about customer growth. So yes, we are able to measure customer growth, whether it's members on the credit union platform or customers on the banking platforms. And not only are we adding customers because we're winning share, we're winning new customers. So the net number of customers we serve is greater. But because there is same-store sales growth happening, particularly on the credit side of the business, it's happening on the banking side, but it's been strong on the credit union side of the business as well."

So both of those, too, and I've said it on many earnings calls, the bill pay business, relatively flat for everybody. There's not a whole lot of new stuff happening in traditional bill pay. But the card growth that you've seen, I think under -- or in the high single digit is a good expectation for the card growth, but it will be greater than that for the EPS business as far as what we're seeing right now because of the strength of that platform."

So pipeline, just so we're all clear on terminology, when I talk pipeline, I'm talking about the opportunities that we're working currently that may close in the future as opposed to quota attainment is things that have been booked in the past, and are deals that have already been signed with our customers. But to answer the specifics of your question, no, this is not just a few large clients or something like that. This is a broad suite of solutions that we've been selling to a broad list of customers. Of course, the core success that we've had this year was significant. And so that's a driver. 
I highlighted in my opening comments, the number of Banno customers that we signed this year. So 219 brand-new Banno digital customers. That is becoming an important driver for us as we go forward. But then it's all these other solutions, the treasury management and all the customers that we signed for our payments platforms, including, like I mentioned in my response to Dave Koning's question earlier. Our EPS platform, which we're seeing some nice interest in that as a payments platform for customers going forward.
So it's just a broad variety of solutions. So the point about pent-up demand, and that's a little bit of a tough one because we saw -- sales was lumpier during the height of COVID. But we didn't see -- when you look at it over the 12-month period, we didn't see sales slow down, but it was very lumpy. So I have trouble characterizing it as pent-up demand because the sales happened. They were just not quite a smooth we're normally accustomed to. So I think it's interest in Jack Henry. It's customers coming to Jack Henry, who just haven't done business with us before, and it's because of this broad suite of solutions that we have and all of the new technology that we delivered.
So I highlighted in my opening comments, the work that our Symitar team did around database migration and delivering an entirely new database, the lending team with all the new functionality that we've delivered there this year, the digital team that I've already highlighted. The payments -- PayCenter platform that I talked about in my opening comments, where we now enable all these real-time payments through a brand-new ground-up payments platform. So it's a variety of different things that, add them all together, and it was just a really successful sales year."

When you talk about the revenue margin guidance being conservative, can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes of that commentary? And you went over this a little bit. But when you think about beating the 50 basis points margin expansion, does that really coincide with you beating your revenue guidance? And perhaps what kind of investments do you think you could look -- you could see where even if you beat on the revenue guidance, there's some additional investments you'd like to make that might just keep you around that 50 basis points overall for margin expansion for the year?"

So to beat the guidance we gave for non-GAAP revenue, it would mean that we would have some continued implementation of movements from some of our card customers. So move some large debit customers over the continued success in our credit card platform processing. M&A activity, which would drive the convert merge revenue and billable travel that we talked about earlier, and then just implementing. And then obviously, the continued movement of moving our on-prem customers into our private cloud also helps our margins.
So there's several different drivers that could cause us to beat that non-GAAP revenue guidance. And from what I'm seeing, I think that's probably going to happen, but I'm not willing to step down that limit and say how much at this point. And every one of those things that I just mentioned can also help to improve margin.
As far as investments, I mean we just finished our budget. And I don't know that -- even if we beat revenue guidance, I don't know that there's any big investments out there that we need to make that we're not already making either from a cap software development or from CapEx that's not already in the budget, which is part of that guidance."

So it's not this calendar year, it will be next year. This year, the major deliverable for the Banno group is Banno business, which is the -- if you think about all the functionality we have on the consumer side with Banno, in a couple of months here, we'll deliver all that same type functionality on the business side of the solution. And then it will be next calendar year that we'll start delivering outside the base.
But as I've stressed on these calls in the past, most banks and credit unions in the United States, I'm not just talking about Jack Henry core customers, I'm talking in general, most of them have an Internet banking offering and a mobile banking offering, and they are 2 different things, 2 different experiences. Consumers don't want 2 different experiences anymore. They expect to have a single experience when they go to access their information from their financial institution, and it doesn't matter what the form factor is. If they're on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC, they expect to have the same experience. And so that creates opportunity for us inside and outside our base. And so -- and that's not changing anytime soon. There are thousands of institutions out there who will, over the next several years, upgrade their digital experience, and we plan to be there with Banno outside the base next year.
As far as the size of the business, we don't call that out as a separate business. We have discussed at some point, would we possibly do that as a segment, but we're not there yet. But it's -- the 5.6 million users I've been asked on these calls before, there are some pure play offerings out there that you can kind of do the math and figure out, based on their number of users, what the revenue per user is. Is that transferable to Jack Henry? My answer is generally yes, that's transferable. So you can kind of figure out how large the business is. The thing that I will stress is for that business, our digital business operates under the same rules as our other businesses at Jack Henry, which means you don't get a pass on making money. You have to produce operating income, operating results in addition to revenue growth. And certainly, the Banno business is doing that for Jack Henry. So it's continuing to grow nicely. We'll continue to grow nicely based on all the things we're seeing right now, the backlog of installs that we have right now. And we'll continue to produce operating -- bottom line operating results for our company."

Nobody is buying payroll solutions from a provider like us anymore. We haven't sold a copy in 20 years. Why we put the effort into replatforming that product? 
So if you look at the broad suite of solutions that we offer, it isn't logical to try and move everything to a new platform. But for all those that are the real high demand solutions, they've either been put into a completely open environment or they're in process of offering that type of solution. And many have been important to public cloud offerings. So we're in both Azure and AWS today with some of our solutions. We have many in our private cloud. So it's just because of the broad suite of products that we have, it's just kind of naturally a variety of different platforms that we offer them on.

So our total R&D spend has grown at almost the exact same pace as our top line revenue for the last 10 years. I don't see that changing. I think we're going to continue that. And I would tell you that the way -- we don't do really big bang productions.
I mean we do sprints and do try to get modules rolled out as quick as possible and do additional modules. So there's no -- not going to see any huge increase in amortization of software in any given year. It's just going to kind of slowly grow because at any given time, this is actually a chart I show the Board every quarter. At any given time, about 85% or 86% of our total cap software on the balance sheet is in production being amortized.
So -- and that hasn't changed for the last -- last few years either. So what that tells you is we're continuing to develop all that software. We continue to roll it out. But at the same time, in 5 years, some of the stuff in the amortization has done amortizing. So you got an offset there. So I don't think that we're going to do anything crazy in the foreseeable future. There's going to have much of an impact on either cash flow or the P&L, other than what you've seen in the last few years."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth.

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter particularly in light of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and continue to evaluate options regarding an appropriate return to office target for all affected employees. 
With that, let's shift our focus to look at our performance for the quarter we completed in September. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $2 million over the prior year quarter. 
Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment again performed well and also posted an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. 
Traditionally, our first quarter has been our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected this historical trend to hold true. What we experienced, however, was just the opposite. 
The performance of the sales organization was again very strong with a number of notable wins. In the quarter, we booked 6 competitive core takeaways and 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. Although our rate of 6 takeaways is light as compared to our normal run rate, it is clear to me that a number of deals fell into the month of October because we booked 6 more core takeaways in October alone. 
As we've discussed on prior calls, our convert merge backlog is a good indicator for us of what to expect with coming mergers and acquisitions within our base of customers. We can now see that M&A in the banking space will be very active this year because almost all of our conversion slots for acquired banks are full for the year. We are working to evaluate whether or not we need to add more conversion teams to keep up with the activity. You should expect to see a corresponding increase in deconversion revenue as some of our institutions are acquired by others in the space. Kevin will provide more detail on this line when he shares his comments. 
We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 6 new debit processing clients this quarter and 1 new credit client. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite, with 35 new contracts in Q1. Speaking of our digital suite, we are continuing to implement new financial institution clients on the Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. 
At the end of Q1, we surpassed 6 million registered users on the platform, and that number is growing at about 125,000 users per month. At the same time, our Banno platform continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store. The Banno Digital Suite is well down the path to becoming the industry-leading digital banking solution. 
The continued success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology survey published in August. As they do every year, Bank Directors surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and/or Board members with almost 80% of the respondent banks greater than $500 million in assets. 
This year's survey showed an interesting shift as more than 70% of the responding banks had moved efficiency of operation to the top of their priority list, and improved customer experience and an improved digital experience followed closely behind. To further the point regarding an improved digital experience, this year, 54% of the respondents indicated that their customers prefer to interact with their bank using a digital channel rather than in branch or over the phone. 
The survey also indicated that the median increase in expected technology spending for the coming year was 10% as compared to the prior year. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other solutions offered by Jack Henry, which helped facilitate an improved customer experience and an opportunity to enhance efficiency in the financial institution. 
As many of you know, we normally conduct our 2 largest client conferences in the fall each year. This year, we combined those conferences into one event and again hosted the sessions virtually. We had hoped to be in person this year, but because of the size of the event, we decided that wasn't prudent. As we saw last year, attendance was much larger than our in-person conferences because nobody had to incur any travel expense and they were able to readily drop into virtual sessions. 
We were pleased to be able to successfully interact in a virtual setting with many of our existing clients and prospects. Last week, we announced 2 pending retirements from our leadership team. Our long-time CFO and Treasurer, Kevin Williams; and our CTO, Ted Bilke, have both announced their intent to retire next summer. As we shared in the press release, we already have a search in process to find Kevin's replacement and we'll be considering both internal and external candidates. Kevin will be with us until we identify the right person and have them fully prepared to take the reins. 
Ted will transition out of his role in January when Ben Metz, our current Head of Digital Solutions, will become our Chief Digital and Technology Officer. Ted will stay for several months after that to help bend with the transition. Of course, we have many months before each of them actually retire. So I have lots of time to thank them for their many years of service to our associates, customers and shareholders. But I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how much I've enjoyed working with each of them and how much I appreciate the approach each of them has taken to executing these much deserved retirements. 
Next week, we will conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting. We will be hosting this meeting in person in Monett, but will abide by strict COVID protocols to ensure a safe event for all attendees. We are excited to be able to meet with our shareholders in person again, but we are also very aware of the ongoing pandemic-related concerns that arise when you assemble a group of people. We will start an hour earlier than in past years, will require all attendees to be masked, and we won't be serving a lunch following the meeting. With these changes, I'm confident we will have a productive and safe meeting. 
In our ongoing attempt to communicate effectively regarding our ESG-related efforts, we recently published our ESG statement which provides a succinct and centralized overview of Jack Henry's ESG commitments and material environmental and social topics. Additionally, it points readers toward other related policies like our human rights policy. We've also published an environmental policy that highlights our commitment to sustainability and proper environmental management practices. Both documents can be found on our new corporate responsibility website via Investor Relations. We created this website to house our sustainability reports and provide a centralized location for Jack Henry's ESG information. 
Speaking of sustainability reports, our next sustainability report covering calendar year 2021 will be published in March. We have continued to make major advances across our environmental, social and governance initiatives and the Board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss ESG matters. As we move forward, I'm very optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."

Service and support revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of FY '22 compared to same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees were actually down $2 million compared to last year or 37% for the quarter. License revenue",1109,"Thanks, Dave. Service and support revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of FY '22 compared to same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees were actually down $2 million compared to last year or 37% for the quarter. License revenue was down slightly compared to the prior year and our hardware revenue was down $4 million or 39% compared to Q1 a year ago. This due to our customers continue to choose our private cloud delivery and therefore, not purchasing hardware. 
Services and support line of revenue -- primary revenue drivers were our software subscription revenue and our data processing hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which combined continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year growing combined by 10% for the quarter. However, the growth in this line was slowed significantly due to the product building services revenue, which includes the previously mentioned deconversion fees license and hardware along implementation and convert merge revenue, which combined were down by a total of 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Therefore, total support and services net grew 6% for the quarter. 
Our processing revenue increased 12% in the first quarter FY '22 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes with new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong. 
As Dave mentioned, total revenue was up 8% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. The increase primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance card and transaction processing along with higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Research development expense increased 3% for the quarter of FY '22 compared to last year. This increase primarily due to personnel costs. And our SG&A expense increased 13% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year. And this increase was due primarily to increased personnel costs and travel-related costs compared to last year as travel increased significantly in Q1 compared to last year. 
Our reported consolidated operating margins increased from 26% last year to 27.4% in the current year or 140 bp increase. And on a non-GAAP basis, operating margins expanded from 25.2% last year to 26.9% this year for 170 bps expansion. We had margin expansion in all 3 of our reporting operating segments on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal '22 increased to 23.4% compared to 22.4% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we provided on the previous call. Our net income grew 12% to $102.1 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to $91.2 million last year with earnings per share of $1.38 for the quarter compared to $1.19 last year for a $0.19 or 16% increase year-over-year. 
For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed into service. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $4.3 million this year compared to $4.4 million in last year's quarter. Our depreciation was down 2% compared to the prior fiscal year. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $34 million. 
Our operating cash flow was $106.5 million for the year, which was down from $114.5 million last year which decreased primarily due to the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considering in the calculation of operating cash flow. We invested $46n.5 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposed assets was $60.1 million for the quarter. 
Our cash position at September 30 was $44.3 million compared to $195.3 million a year ago, primarily due to the significant stock repurchase we did last year. We had $65 million drawn on a revolver at the end of the quarter, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases. Return on our average assets for trailing 12 months is 13.7%. 
Our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 21.5%, and return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 21.9%, which are all very strong. For FY '20 guidance, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP updated revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for fiscal '22. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release immediately following the segment information in the release yesterday. 
However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve. And if things were to go differently, obviously, this guidance will be revised. For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22 based on the amounts in the British yesterday, our revenue guidance is a range of 8.6% to 9.1% approximately over previous year. We now anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $42 million to $43 million for the entire fiscal year with a significant percentage of that being in Q2 and Q3. For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to a range of 7.5% to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year. We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have very nice margin expansion in our payments segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees. However, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an operating margin expansion as we will continue to have headwinds on license and order revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to our private cloud and also travel costs will continue to increase significantly compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate for FY '22 continues to be projected slightly higher at approximately 23% compared to the prior year obviously, significant changes in corporate tax structure could change this guidance. And our FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $4.64 to $4.73 and which is an increase from the prior guidance of $4.53 to $4.60. This concludes our only comments. We are now ready to take questions. Brian, will you please open the call lines up for questions."

We'll be sad to see you go, but we have a couple of more quarters to talk with you. I guess my first question is on the inward merger comment that I think David you make, but you're seeing strength there. I know last quarter, you kind of have said that you expected to be better this year, but it didn't seem like you were really including much in the guide. So I just want to get a sense of what you're including in the guide versus what could be sort of upside based on what you're seeing?"

They notify us well ahead of time, well before the conversion actually -- or the acquisition actually happens. They notify us that they will need our help to convert the acquired institution on to the Jack Henry platform. And so we hold those slots. And -- so in the past several weeks here, that volume has increased significantly of customers contacting us to hold conversion flats and essentially sign contracts to a lot goes in. And so that's why what I said in my comments was every conversion slot now on the banking side of our business is filled for convert merge activity through the remainder of the fiscal year. And we're evaluating whether or not we need to add more teams. And the reason for that evaluation is we have to keep an eye on, does a deal fall through since they notify us well ahead of time and ask us to hold a slot and the they will -- we'll sort of contract in front of them. But does that deal fall through. We have -- we've been doing this for a long time. We're very good at predicting what's going to actually happen and what's not. But everything that we have today that is known, that is booked is worked into the guidance that Kevin provided to you. But there is more potential opportunity out there. We may stand up if demand justifies it. We may stand up an additional conversion team or even 2 conversion teams. We've done that in the past. And so we'll just kind of have to follow that as it goes. But what we know today is included in the guidance that Kevin has shared with you, but there is still potentially more opportunity there based on what happens with our customers. The key messaging there was just for you all to know that convert merger or M&A is back in the banking space. And so that not only is a real positive for us and that we have customers acquiring other other customers, and we generally are paid on account volume and transaction volume. So that's good for us when they get merged in. But then also for you to be aware that deconversion revenue will probably go up because we know that some of our customers will also be acquired away from us as M&A continues to grow."

I think just the revenues in the quarter were a tad lighter than what we were modeling. I just -- I'm curious to see where they came in relative to your internal expectations. And I know debit volume sort of rolled off a bit. Is that probably impactful to your payment segment? And then if you could also comment on what's going on in the bill pay business? I know software trends across the peer group. But if you could just comment on if you have any insights on, is that just more competition from digital wallets or something else, which is driving bill pay revenue to be flattish."

So 3 primary components in the payments line for us or the payment segment for us. There's bill pay revenue. There's card revenue, debit and credit. And then there is what we refer to as EPS, enterprise payment solutions -- The bill pay line or the bill pay business continues to be relatively flat. I mean there's some growth. But as we've talked about on the call before, anybody who needs a bill pay solution, has a bill pay solution, volumes aren't really fluctuating that much. So it's relatively flat in the bill pay business. The card business is continuing to grow. We're seeing nice growth, not only because we're adding customers, but because now as the pandemic numbers have dropped again here in the early fall, transaction volumes. We've seen a definite correlation between transaction volumes increasing as infections have -- reported infections have dropped. And so that's a key part. 
But the enterprise payments business is continuing to grow very nicely. It's the smallest piece of that segment, but the fastest-growing piece of that segment. And that is driven by remote posit capture, but also by ACH originations. And so we have a number of customers who have signed with that platform recently and some that we'll announce next year, I think, as they come live, that will be continuing to drive big volumes through that platform. So it's the combination of those things that I think are driving the payments revenue and all of those are positioned well for continued growth in the coming year."

I mean, so obviously, travel is going to be a lot higher. So there's other costs there. Our salespeople are getting out and traveling more. So just the travel expense is going to be higher. I mean, is it possible that our total margin expense should be higher? Yes. 
Obviously, the Q1 margins are probably the highest of the year because of all the software subscription revenue that we recognized in Q1 for the software that's been delivered in the previous years. So this is a high watermark for margins for the year. But the other thing I'll say, [indiscernible] was down almost 40% this quarter, which that actually helps our margins by hardware revenue being down, which -- I mean, it sounds weird, but if hardware revenue would level out and go back up a little bit for the rest of the year, I'm sure IBM will come out with additional hardware upgrades. Could that impact our margins? Yes. So I mean I'm still very comfortable that we can hit the 50 bps and could it be higher than that? Yes.

We are working -- so the thing about the Banno platform is it is built to work with -- to be an open API-based platform. So modern technology stack, open EPI based platform. You saw -- hopefully, you saw the press release we did in October where we announced the partnership and integration of Finicity Akoya and Plad. So all of those relationships are designed to provide greater functionality on this digital platform to connect fintech solutions to other fintech solutions. Our goal with the platform is not only to offer the best experience for the consumer and small business through a single digital experience but also to provide the best platform in the industry to create that interconnectivity of applications to other applications. 
The other thing that we're trying to do through all of that -- this is important when you compare kind of the modern technology stack like we have with Banno as compared to other things that are out there is we are close to being able to eliminate screen scraping. And if you're not -- if you're not familiar with that term of screen scraping, that's what happens with older applications where a consumer, let's say you're trying to consolidate all of your accounts on 1 -- in 1 experience on 1 spot, 1 digital experience. Well, the old approach, which most companies out there are using widely today is green scraping, where the consumer provides their credentials, their log on and password into some central location. And that central location goes out and essentially simulates being a consumer going on and pulling down balance information. Well, you can probably imagine the security -- potential security and privacy issues that come along with that. And so we've been working very diligently for several years to eliminate all of that in our platforms. And the -- This integration that we've done with Finicity a con Platt and the other moves that we've made with our digital platform have us right on the cusp of eliminating all of that well ahead of anybody else, any of our traditional competitors when it comes to offering a truly state-of-the-art digital experience."

Because it looks to us like growth in core and really the whole business, you're doing about as good or actually better like your core segments about the best it's been in a few years in ter of growth? Like it just seems like momentum is as strong as ever. There's no real like competitive changes in the environment, if anything, it seems like the environment is strengthening maybe for you. Is that fair to say? 
It's fair to say. So we are -- you're accurate. We're signing and I've emphasized as many times signing core takeaways, gaining share on the core side of the business. But a lot of that is driven by all this other outstanding technology that we're delivering and the tight integration that we're doing not just with Jack Henry products, other Jack Henry products, but Jack Henry products to the other things out there in the industry that people want to be able to use, the fintech solutions out there. We are providing that connectivity easily in the press release. If you look at the headline, it's 0 cost, 0 lift. So we're doing all that for our customers, 0 cost, 0 lift. Why would you do that? Hey, it's the right thing to do. But in the long run, it's less expensive for us as a provider if our customers will adopt those types of things. All of that though, all of that approach, all of that philosophy around delivering technology is being recognized in our industry, and Jack Henry is getting credit for it and customers are moving to our platforms as a result."

When we use the term partnership, that doesn't mean that we're reselling somebody else's stuff that we're exchanging revenue, that there's something like that or that we're missing a piece. In this day and age, with all of the new feature function that's happening with fintechs. And with the demand that our customers that bankers have from their customers, their consumers to use different things, different pieces of technology that they've come across. The future for banking and the future for a provider like us is to provide open connectivity so that the customer, our customer, the banker can choose to integrate whatever they want to integrate into our platform. What we're moving toward what consumers are moving toward is they're very sensitive to the fact that the data is their data. Like I'm the consumer, it's my data. It's not your data, it's my data. And so it happens to be housed at this bank. But I want access to that data. And so the bank is now more than ever, very sensitive to that idea that they need to provide access to that data in a secure manner to a variety of different sources that the consumer chooses to want to use or that the bank may choose to want to use. So we are continuing to innovate on our technology. I mean the reason that the Banno platform is so well regarded. -- and has the highest ratings in the app store is because we have the best functionality out there. But you can't do everything, right? Every -- not every idea that every fintech comes up, it's just not possible to write all of that code into 1 application. And so providing that platform for open connectivity is the best of all worlds. It gives us this reputation of being open and being innovative. But it also provides the banker the opportunity to connect whatever they want to connect into that platform and take advantage of the data for the benefit of their consumer, whether the consumer is an individual or if it's a small business. And so -- what we are doing today is being recognized regularly as being really industry-leading in providing that open connectivity and that opportunity for the banker to choose as opposed to us going to them and say, ""You must use our platform, whether you like it or not."" 
And this is not new for us. We have always been extremely open. I'm back from when Jack and Jerry started the company 45 years ago. we've always been open because we started as just a core provider, and we had to let them use any third party. I mean if you think about our investor conference that Dave referred to as opening comments, I mean we typically have well over 100 over 300 other vendors at our tech fair to show their wear. So we've always been open. The fact that open APIs just makes it that much easier for a third party to integrate into our core solutions."

Go ahead. Just to file on on this. I guess for clients that do get taken away and that create these deconversion fees. What about the win-back rates, perhaps the 1 that got taken out was using Jack Henry really liked it, and then they kind of explain the benefits there and then you could win perhaps the entire relationship later. Does that happen? Maybe you can discuss all those factors."

You'll give me about 1.5 hours. I'll try and fill you in. So no, seriously. So first off, we -- when M&A happens, I'll answer your question from the beginning and work forward. Does it happen that customers are acquired away and then they come back to Jack Henry. Yes, that happens. And in fact, it's more often than you might think where somebody gets acquired, the logical thing is for the acquiring institution to convert them to whatever they're running. And then once they get integrated in, the people who have been acquired, the people who have been acquired start to say we had it better on the old platform than we have on this new platform. Let us tell you guys what we used to be able to do with Jack Henry. And it's oftentimes a combination of the technology and the relationships. This is a relationship business. partnership is a key part of what we do. And so oftentimes, the acquired institution will educate the acquirer on what I would like to do business with Jack Henry. So we do win those occasionally. The other thing that we win once in a while is what let's say, that an acquirer is targeting one of our institutions. We know that, that's happening. We can oftentimes sell the acquirer on converting to the Jack Henry platform as opposed to the acquirer using whatever it was they had before the acquisition was announced or before the deal was announced. And so those -- we refer to those as when a merger and those we've been successful at. But kind of the heart of your question, the beginning of your question, was -- that is the power. The beginning of your question -- sorry, we have a little phone issue going on here. The beginning of your question, most of the M&A activity is happening at the low end of the range. So real small institutions being acquired by larger institutions. And we don't tend to serve the real small institutions. So that tends to be good for us. that usually we are the benefactor, 1 of our institutions acquiring a smaller institution as opposed to ours being acquired away. But to the very beginning of your question, what that means is our asset base among our customers is growing because those larger customers in our base are acquiring smaller customers. And so over time, we will continue to grow as far as average asset size."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth.

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and continue to evaluate options regarding an appropriate return to office target for all affected employees.  
With that, let's shift our focus to look at our performance for the quarter we completed in September. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $2 million over the prior year quarter.  
Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the Core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment again performed well and also posted an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses, with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis.  
Traditionally, our first quarter has been our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected this historical trend to hold true. What we experienced, however, was just the opposite.  
The performance of the sales organization was again very strong, with a number of notable wins. In the quarter, we booked 6 competitive core takeaways and 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. Although our rate of 6 takeaways is light as compared to our normal run rate, it is clear to me that a number of deals fell into the month of October because we booked 6 more core takeaways in October alone.  
As we've discussed on prior calls, our convert merge backlog is a good indicator for us of what to expect with coming mergers and acquisitions within our base of customers. We can now see that M&A in the banking space will be very active this year because almost all of our conversion slots for acquired banks are full for the year. We are working to evaluate whether or not we need to add more conversion teams to keep up with the activity. You should expect to see a corresponding increase in deconversion revenue as some of our institutions are acquired by others in the space. Kevin will provide more detail on this line when he shares his comments.  
We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 6 new debit processing clients this quarter and 1 new credit client. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite, with 35 new contracts in Q1. Speaking of our digital suite, we are continuing to implement new financial institution clients on the Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. 
At the end of Q1, we surpassed 6 million registered users on the platform, and that number is growing at about 125,000 users per month. At the same time, our Banno platform continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store. The Banno digital suite is well down the path to becoming the industry-leading digital banking solution. 
The continued success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology Survey published in August. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and/or Board members, with almost 80% of the respondent banks greater than $500 million in assets. 
This year's survey showed an interesting shift as more than 70% of the responding banks had moved efficiency of operation to the top of their priority list, and improved customer experience and an improved digital experience followed closely behind. To further the point regarding an improved digital experience, this year, 54% of the respondents indicated that their customers prefer to interact with their bank using a digital channel rather than in-branch or over the phone. 
The survey also indicated that the median increase in expected technology spending for the coming year was 10% as compared to the prior year. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other solutions offered by Jack Henry, which help facilitate an improved customer experience and an opportunity to enhance efficiency in the financial institution. 
As many of you know, we normally conduct our 2 largest client conferences in the fall each year. This year, we combined those conferences into one event and, again, hosted these sessions virtually. We had hoped to be in-person this year, but because of the size of the event, we decided that wasn't prudent. 
As we saw last year, attendance was much larger than our in-person conferences because nobody had to incur any travel expense, and they were able to readily drop into virtual sessions. We were pleased to be able to successfully interact in a virtual setting with many of our existing clients and prospects. 
Last week, we announced 2 pending retirements from our leadership team. Our long-time CFO and Treasurer, Kevin Williams; and our CTO, Ted Bilke, have both announced their intent to retire next summer. As we shared in the press release, we already have a search in process to find Kevin's replacement, and we'll be considering both internal and external candidates. Kevin will be with us until we identify the right person and have them fully prepared to take the reins.  
Ted will transition out of his role in January when Ben Metz, our current Head of Digital Solutions, will become our Chief Digital and Technology Officer. Ted will stay for several months after that to help Ben with the transition. 
Of course, we have many months before each of them actually retire, so I have lots of time to thank them for their many years of service to our associates, customers and shareholders. But I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how much I've enjoyed working with each of them and how much I appreciate the approach each of them has taken to executing these much-deserved retirements.  
Next week, we will conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting. We will be hosting this meeting in person in Monett, but we'll abide by strict COVID protocols to ensure a safe event for all attendees. We are excited to be able to meet with our shareholders in person again, but we are also very aware of the ongoing pandemic-related concerns that arise when you assemble a group of people. 
We will start an hour earlier than in past years. We'll require all attendees to be masked, and we won't be serving a lunch following the meeting. With these changes, I'm confident we will have a productive and safe meeting.  
In our ongoing attempt to communicate effectively regarding our ESG-related efforts, we recently published our ESG statement, which provides a succinct and centralized overview of Jack Henry's ESG commitments and material environmental and social topics. Additionally, it points readers toward other related policies like our human rights policy. 
We've also published an environmental policy that highlights our commitment to sustainability and proper environmental management practices. Both documents can be found on our new Corporate Responsibility website via Investor Relations. We created this website to house our sustainability reports and provide a centralized location for Jack Henry's ESG information.  
Speaking of sustainability reports, our next sustainability report covering calendar year 2021 will be published in March. We have continued to make major advances across our environmental, social and governance initiatives, and the Board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss ESG matters. 
As we move forward, I'm very optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."

As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees were actually down $2 million compared to last year or 37% for the quarter. License revenue was down slightly compared to the prior year, and our hardware revenue was down $4 million or 39% compared to Q1 a year ago. This is due to our customers continuing to choose our private cloud delivery and, therefore, not purchasing hardware.  
Services and support line of revenue -- primary revenue drivers were our software subscription revenue and our data processing hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which, combined, continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing combined by 10% for the quarter. However, the growth in this line was slowed significantly due to the product delivery and services revenue, which includes the previously mentioned deconversion fees, license and hardware, along with implementation and convert merge revenue, which, combined, were down by a total of 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Therefore, total support and services net grew 6% for the quarter.  
Our processing revenue increased 12% in the first quarter FY '22 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes with new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong.  
As Dave mentioned, total revenue was up 8% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance, card and transaction processing, along with higher personnel costs, compared to a year ago. 
Research and development expense increased 3% for the quarter of FY '22 compared to last year. This increase is primarily due to personnel costs. And our SG&A expense increased 13% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year. And this increase was due primarily to increased personnel costs and travel-related costs compared to last year as travel increased significantly in Q1 compared to last year.  
Our reported consolidated operating margins increased from 26% last year to 27.4% in the current year or 140 bps increase. And on a non-GAAP basis, operating margins expanded from 25.2% last year to 26.9% this year for a 170 bps expansion. We had margin expansion in all 3 of our reporting operating segments on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal '22 increased to 23.4% compared to 22.4% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we provided on the previous call. Our net income grew 12% to $102.1 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to $91.2 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.38 for the quarter compared to $1.19 last year for a $0.19 or 16% increase year-over-year.  
For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed into service. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $4.3 million this year compared to $4.4 million in last year's quarter. Our depreciation was down 2% compared to the prior fiscal year. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $34 million.  
Our operating cash flow was $106.5 million for the year, which was down from $114.5 million last year, which decreased primarily due to the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow. We invested $46.5 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposed assets, was $60.1 million for the quarter. 
Our cash position at September 30 was $44.3 million compared to $195.3 million a year ago, primarily due to the significant stock repurchasing we did last year. We had $65 million drawn on our revolver at the end of the quarter, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases. Return on our average assets for trailing 12 months is 13.7%. Our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 21.5%, and return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 21.9%, which are all very strong. 
For FY '22 guidance, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP updated revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for fiscal '22. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release, immediately following the segment information in the release yesterday. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve. And if things were to go differently, obviously, this guidance will be revised. 
For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22 based on the amounts in the release yesterday, our revenue guidance is a range of 8.6% to 9.1% approximately over previous year. We now anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $42 million to $43 million for the entire fiscal year, with a significant percentage of that being in Q2 and Q3. For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to a range of 7.5% to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year. 
We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have very nice margin expansion in our Payments segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees. However, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an operating margin expansion as we will continue to have headwinds on license and order revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to our private cloud, and also travel costs will continue to increase significantly compared to the prior year. 
Our effective tax rate for FY '22 continues to be projected slightly higher at approximately 23% compared to the prior year, obviously, significant changes in corporate tax structure could change this guidance. And our FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $4.64 to $4.73, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $4.53 to $4.60. 
This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Brian, will you please open the call lines up for questions?"

We'll be sad to see you go, but we have a couple of more quarters to talk with you. I guess, my first question is on the convert merger comment that I think, David, you made that you're seeing strength there. 
I know, last quarter, you kind of have said that you expected to be better this year, but it didn't seem like you were really including much in the guide. So I just wanted to get a sense of what you're including in the guide versus what could be sort of upside based on what you're seeing?"

They notify us well ahead of time, well before the conversion actually -- or the acquisition actually happens. They notify us that they will need our help to convert the acquired institution on to the Jack Henry platform. And so we hold those slots. 
And -- so in the past several weeks here, that volume has increased significantly of customers contacting us to hold conversion slots and essentially sign contracts to -- a lot goes in. And so that's why, what I said in my comments was, every conversion slot now on the banking side of our business is filled for convert merge activity through the remainder of the fiscal year. And we're evaluating whether or not we need to add more teams. 
And the reason for that evaluation is, we have to keep an eye on, does a deal fall through? Since they notify us well ahead of time and ask us to hold a slot, then they -- they will be -- we'll sort of contract in front of them. But does that deal fall through? We have a -- we've been doing this for a long time. We're very good at predicting what's going to actually happen and what's not. 
But everything that we have today that is known, that is booked, is worked into the guidance that Kevin provided to you. But there is more potential opportunity out there. We may stand up if demand justifies it. We may stand up an additional conversion team or even 2 conversion teams. We've done that in the past. And so we'll just kind of have to follow that as it goes. 
But what we know today is included in the guidance that Kevin has shared with you, but there is still potentially more opportunity there based on what happens with our customers. The key messaging there was just for you all to know that convert merge or M&A is back in the banking space. 
And so that not only is a real positive for us -- and that we have customers acquiring other customers, and we generally are paid on account volume and transaction volume, so that's good for us when they get merged in. But then also, for you to be aware, that deconversion revenue will probably go up because we know that some of our customers will also be acquired away from us as M&A continues to grow."

And I know debit volumes sort of rolled off a bit. Is that probably impactful to your Payments segment? And then if you could also comment on what's going on in the bill pay business. I know software trends across the peer group, but if you could just comment on -- if you have any insights on -- is that just more competition from digital wallets, or something else, which is driving bill pay revenue to be flattish?"

So there's a lot in the -- on the Payments line, of course, 3, and you kind of highlighted there. So 3 primary components in the Payments line for us or the Payments segment for us: there's bill pay revenue; there's card revenue, debit and credit; and then there is what we refer to as EPS, Enterprise Payment Solutions. 
The bill pay line or the bill pay business continues to be relatively flat. I mean there's some growth, but as we've talked about on the call before, anybody who needs a bill pay solution has a bill pay solution. Volumes aren't really fluctuating that much. So it's relatively flat on the bill pay business. 
The card business is continuing to grow. We're seeing nice growth not only because we're adding customers, but because now, as the pandemic numbers have dropped again here in the early fall, transaction volumes -- we've seen a definite correlation between transaction volumes increasing as infections have -- reported infections have dropped. And so that's a key part. 
But the Enterprise Payments business is continuing to grow very nicely. It's the smallest piece of that segment, but the fastest-growing piece of that segment. And that is driven by Remote Deposit Capture, but also by ACH originations. 
And so we have a number of customers who have signed with that platform recently and some that we'll announce next year, I think, as they come live, that will be continuing to drive big volumes through that platform. So it's the combination of those things that I think are driving the Payments revenue, and all of those are positioned well for continued growth in the coming year."

The core -- it's been interesting watching core deals as we've come out of the real trough of the pandemic. And obviously, the pandemic isn't over, but core deals are really lumpy right now. But there is a tremendous amount of activity as far as that side of the business.

I mean, is it possible that our total margin expense should be higher? Yes. Obviously, the Q1 margins are probably the highest of the year because of all the software subscription revenue that we recognized in Q1 for all the software that's been delivered in the previous years. So this is a high watermark for margins for the year. 
But the other thing I'll say is, Kartik, you know, the quarter -- it was down almost 40% this quarter, which was -- that actually helps our margins by hardware revenue being down, which -- I mean, it sounds weird. But if hardware revenue would level out and go back up a little bit for the rest of the year, as I'm sure IBM will come out with additional hardware upgrades, could that impact our margins? Yes. So I mean, I'm still very comfortable that we can hit the 50 bps. And could it be higher than that? Yes. But I'm not -- I'm just not ready to step out on that limb yet."

Well, I'm not exactly sure what you're including in the super app bucket, Dave. I mean there's lots of stuff going on out there. We are working -- so the thing about the Banno platform is it is built to work with -- to be an open API-based platform. So modern technology stack, open API-based platform. You saw -- hopefully, you saw the press release we did in October where we announced the partnership and integration of Finicity, Akoya and Plaid. So all of those relationships are designed to provide greater functionality on this digital platform to connect fintech solutions to other fintech solutions. 
Our goal with the platform is not only to offer the best experience for the consumer and small business through a single digital experience, but also to provide the best platform in the industry to create that interconnectivity of applications to other applications. The other thing that we're trying to do through all of that -- this is important, when you compare kind of the modern technology stack like we have with Banno as compared to other things that are out there, is we are close to being able to eliminate screen scraping. 
And if you're not -- if you're not familiar with that term of screen scraping, that's what happens with older applications, where a consumer -- let's say you're trying to consolidate all of your accounts on one -- in one experience on one spot, one digital experience. Well, the old approach, which most companies out there are using widely today, is green scraping, where the consumer provides their credentials, their log on and password into some central location, and that central location goes out and essentially simulates being a consumer going on and pulling down balance information. 
Well, you can probably imagine the security -- potential security and privacy issues that come along with that. And so we've been working very diligently for several years to eliminate all of that in our platforms. And this integration that we've done with Finicity, Akoya and Plaid and the other moves that we've made with our digital platform have us right on the cusp of eliminating all of that well ahead of anybody else, any of our traditional competitors, when it comes to offering a truly state-of-the-art digital experience."

When we use the term partnership, that doesn't mean that we're reselling somebody else's stuff that we're exchanging revenue, that there's something like that or that we're missing a piece. In this day and age, with all of the new feature function that's happening with fintechs and with the demand that our customers, that bankers have from their customers, their consumers to use different things, different pieces of technology that they've come across, the future for banking and the future for a provider like us is to provide open connectivity so that the customer, our customer, the banker can choose to integrate whatever they want to integrate into our platform. 
What we're moving toward -- what consumers are moving toward is they're very sensitive to the fact that the data is their data. Like I'm the consumer, it's my data. It's not your data, it's my data. And so it happens to be housed at this bank, but I want access to that data. And so the bank is now, more than ever, very sensitive to that idea that they need to provide access to that data in a secure manner to a variety of different sources that the consumer chooses to want to use or that the bank may choose to want to use. 
So we are continuing to innovate on our technology. I mean the reason that the Banno platform is so well regarded and has the highest ratings in the App Store is because we have the best functionality out there. But you can't do everything, right? Every -- not every idea that every fintech comes up, it's just not possible to write all of that code into 1 application. 
And so providing that platform for open connectivity is the best of all worlds. It gives us this reputation of being open and being innovative, but it also provides the banker the opportunity to connect whatever they want to connect into that platform and take advantage of the data for the benefit of their consumer, whether the consumer is an individual or if it's a small business. And so -- what we are doing today is being recognized regularly as being really industry-leading in providing that open connectivity and that opportunity for the banker to choose, as opposed to us going to them and say, ""You must use our platform, whether you like it or not."" 
And this is not new for us. We have always been extremely open. I'm back from when Jack and Jerry started the company 45 years ago. We've always been open because we started as just a core provider, and we had to let them use any third party. I mean, if you think about our investor conference that Dave referred to in his opening comments, I mean, we typically have well over 100 and over 300 other vendors at our tech fair to show up their wares. So we've always been open. The fact that open APIs just makes it that much easier for a third party to integrate into our core solutions."

You'll give me about 1.5 hours while I try and fill you in. So no, seriously. So first off, we -- when M&A happens, I'll answer your question from the beginning and work forward, does it happen that customers are acquired away and then they come back to Jack Henry? Yes, that happens. 
And in fact, it's more often than you might think, where somebody gets acquired, the logical thing is for the acquiring institution to convert them to whatever they're running. And then once they get integrated in, the people who have been acquired -- the people who have been acquired suddenly start to say we had it better on the old platform than we have on this new platform. Let us tell you guys what we used to be able to do with Jack Henry. 
And it's oftentimes a combination of the technology and the relationships. This is a relationship business. Partnership is a key part of what we do. And so oftentimes, the acquired institution will educate the acquirer on what it was like to do business with Jack Henry. So we do win those occasionally. 
The other thing that we win once in a while is what -- let's say that an acquirer is targeting one of our institutions. We know that, that's happening. We can oftentimes sell the acquirer on converting to the Jack Henry platform as opposed to the acquirer using whatever it was they had before the acquisition was announced or before the deal was announced. And so those -- we refer to those as win a merger and those we've been successful at. 
But kind of the heart of your question, the beginning of your question, was -- that is the power? The beginning of your question -- sorry, we have a little phone issue going on here. The beginning of your question, most of the M&A activity is happening at the low end of the range. So real small institutions being acquired by larger institutions. 
And we don't tend to serve the real small institutions. So that tends to be good for us that, usually, we are the benefactor, one of our institutions acquiring a smaller institution as opposed to ours being acquired away. But to the very beginning of your question, what that means is our asset base among our customers is growing because those larger customers in our base are acquiring smaller customers. And so over time, we will continue to grow as far as average asset size."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing th",1446,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and continue to evaluate options regarding an appropriate return-to-office target for all affected employees.  
With that, let's shift our focus to look at our performance for the quarter we completed in September. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $2 million over the prior year quarter.  
Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the Core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment again performed well and also posted an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses, with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis.  
Traditionally, our first quarter has been our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected this historical trend to hold true. What we experienced, however, was just the opposite.  
The performance of the sales organization was again very strong, with a number of notable wins. In the quarter, we booked 6 competitive core takeaways and 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. Although our rate of 6 takeaways is light as compared to our normal run rate, it is clear to me that a number of deals fell into the month of October because we booked 6 more core takeaways in October alone.  
As we've discussed on prior calls, our convert merge backlog is a good indicator for us of what to expect with coming mergers and acquisitions within our base of customers. We can now see that M&A in the banking space will be very active this year because almost all of our conversion slots for acquired banks are full for the year. We are working to evaluate whether or not we need to add more conversion teams to keep up with the activity. You should expect to see a corresponding increase in deconversion revenue as some of our institutions are acquired by others in the space. Kevin will provide more detail on this line when he shares his comments.  
We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 6 new debit processing clients this quarter and 1 new credit client. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite, with 35 new contracts in Q1. Speaking of our digital suite, we are continuing to implement new financial institution clients on the Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. 
At the end of Q1, we surpassed 6 million registered users on the platform, and that number is growing at about 125,000 users per month. At the same time, our Banno platform continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store. The Banno digital suite is well down the path to becoming the industry-leading digital banking solution. 
The continued success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology Survey published in August. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and/or Board members, with almost 80% of the respondent banks greater than $500 million in assets. 
This year's survey showed an interesting shift as more than 70% of the responding banks had moved efficiency of operation to the top of their priority list, and improved customer experience and an improved digital experience followed closely behind. To further the point regarding an improved digital experience, this year, 54% of the respondents indicated that their customers prefer to interact with their bank using a digital channel rather than in-branch or over the phone. 
The survey also indicated that the median increase in expected technology spending for the coming year was 10% as compared to the prior year. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other solutions offered by Jack Henry, which help facilitate an improved customer experience and an opportunity to enhance efficiency in the financial institution. 
As many of you know, we normally conduct our 2 largest client conferences in the fall each year. This year, we combined those conferences into one event and, again, hosted these sessions virtually. We had hoped to be in-person this year, but because of the size of the event, we decided that wasn't prudent. 
As we saw last year, attendance was much larger than our in-person conferences because nobody had to incur any travel expense, and they were able to readily drop into virtual sessions. We were pleased to be able to successfully interact in a virtual setting with many of our existing clients and prospects. 
Last week, we announced 2 pending retirements from our leadership team. Our long-time CFO and Treasurer, Kevin Williams; and our CTO, Ted Bilke, have both announced their intent to retire next summer. As we shared in the press release, we already have a search in process to find Kevin's replacement, and we'll be considering both internal and external candidates. Kevin will be with us until we identify the right person and have them fully prepared to take the reins.  
Ted will transition out of his role in January when Ben Metz, our current Head of Digital Solutions, will become our Chief Digital and Technology Officer. Ted will stay for several months after that to help Ben with the transition. 
Of course, we have many months before each of them actually retire, so I have lots of time to thank them for their many years of service to our associates, customers and shareholders. But I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how much I've enjoyed working with each of them and how much I appreciate the approach each of them has taken to executing these much-deserved retirements.  
Next week, we will conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting. We will be hosting this meeting in person in Monett, but we'll abide by strict COVID protocols to ensure a safe event for all attendees. We are excited to be able to meet with our shareholders in person again, but we are also very aware of the ongoing pandemic-related concerns that arise when you assemble a group of people. 
We will start an hour earlier than in past years. We'll require all attendees to be masked, and we won't be serving a lunch following the meeting. With these changes, I'm confident we will have a productive and safe meeting.  
In our ongoing attempt to communicate effectively regarding our ESG-related efforts, we recently published our ESG statement, which provides a succinct and centralized overview of Jack Henry's ESG commitments and material environmental and social topics. Additionally, it points readers toward other related policies like our human rights policy. 
We've also published an environmental policy that highlights our commitment to sustainability and proper environmental management practices. Both documents can be found on our new Corporate Responsibility website via Investor Relations. We created this website to house our sustainability reports and provide a centralized location for Jack Henry's ESG information.  
Speaking of sustainability reports, our next sustainability report covering calendar year 2021 will be published in March. We have continued to make major advances across our environmental, social and governance initiatives, and the Board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss ESG matters. 
As we move forward, I'm very optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers."

Services and support revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of FY '22 compared to the same quarter a year ago.

Services and support revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of FY '22 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees were actually down $2 million compared to last year or 37% for the quarter. License revenue was down slightly compared to the prior year, and our hardware revenue was down $4 million or 39% compared to Q1 a year ago. This is due to our customers continuing to choose our private cloud delivery and, therefore, not purchasing hardware.  
Services and support line of revenue -- primary revenue drivers were our software subscription revenue and our data processing hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which, combined, continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing combined by 10% for the quarter. However, the growth in this line was slowed significantly due to the product delivery and services revenue, which includes the previously mentioned deconversion fees, license and hardware, along with implementation and convert merge revenue, which, combined, were down by a total of 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Therefore, total support and services net grew 6% for the quarter.  
Our processing revenue increased 12% in the first quarter FY '22 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes with new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong.  
As Dave mentioned, total revenue was up 8% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance, card and transaction processing, along with higher personnel costs, compared to a year ago. 
Research and development expense increased 3% for the quarter of FY '22 compared to last year. This increase is primarily due to personnel costs. And our SG&A expense increased 13% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year. And this increase was due primarily to increased personnel costs and travel-related costs compared to last year as travel increased significantly in Q1 compared to last year.  
Our reported consolidated operating margins increased from 26% last year to 27.4% in the current year or 140 bps increase. And on a non-GAAP basis, operating margins expanded from 25.2% last year to 26.9% this year for a 170 bps expansion. We had margin expansion in all 3 of our reporting operating segments on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal '22 increased to 23.4% compared to 22.4% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we provided on the previous call. Our net income grew 12% to $102.1 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to $91.2 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.38 for the quarter compared to $1.19 last year for a $0.19 or 16% increase year-over-year.  
For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed into service. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $4.3 million this year compared to $4.4 million in last year's quarter. Our depreciation was down 2% compared to the prior fiscal year. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $34 million.  
Our operating cash flow was $106.5 million for the year, which was down from $114.5 million last year, which decreased primarily due to the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow. We invested $46.5 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposed assets, was $60.1 million for the quarter. 
Our cash position at September 30 was $44.3 million compared to $195.3 million a year ago, primarily due to the significant stock repurchasing we did last year. We had $65 million drawn on our revolver at the end of the quarter, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases. Return on our average assets for trailing 12 months is 13.7%. Our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 21.5%, and return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 21.9%, which are all very strong. 
For FY '22 guidance, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP updated revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for fiscal '22. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release, immediately following the segment information in the release yesterday. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve. And if things were to go differently, obviously, this guidance will be revised. 
For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22 based on the amounts in the release yesterday, our revenue guidance is a range of 8.6% to 9.1% approximately over previous year. We now anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $42 million to $43 million for the entire fiscal year, with a significant percentage of that being in Q2 and Q3. For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to a range of 7.5% to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year. 
We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have very nice margin expansion in our Payments segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees. However, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an operating margin expansion as we will continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to our private cloud, and also travel costs will continue to increase significantly compared to the prior year. 
Our effective tax rate for FY '22 continues to be projected slightly higher at approximately 23% compared to the prior year. Obviously, significant changes in corporate tax structure could change this guidance. And our FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $4.64 to $4.73, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $4.53 to $4.60. 
This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Brian, will you please open the call lines up for questions?"

We'll be sad to see you go, but glad we have a couple of more quarters to talk with you. I guess, my first question is on the convert merger comment that I think, David, you made that you're seeing strength there. 
I know, last quarter, you kind of have said that you expected it to be better this year, but it didn't seem like you were really including much in the guide. So I just wanted to get a sense of what you're including in the guide versus what would be sort of upside based on what you're seeing?"
277617,1686162851,2465876,"Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2021",2021-11-09,"Earnings Calls","Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.","Executives","So I think every -- as I said in my comments, the convert merge slots -- and just to make sure everybody is clear, when we reference convert merge, it happens when one of our institutions is acquiring another institution.

They notify us well ahead of time, well before the conversion actually -- or the acquisition actually happens. They notify us that they will need our help to convert the acquired institution on to the Jack Henry platform. And so we hold those slots. 
And -- so in the past several weeks here, that volume has increased significantly, of customers contacting us to hold conversion slots and essentially sign contracts to allot those in. And so that's why, what I said in my comments was, every conversion slot now on the banking side of our business is filled for convert merge activity through the remainder of the fiscal year. And we're evaluating whether or not we need to add more teams. 
And the reason for that evaluation is, we have to keep an eye on, does a deal fall through? Since they notify us well ahead of time and ask us to hold a slot, then they -- they will be -- we'll sort of contract in front of them. But does that deal fall through? We have a -- we've been doing this for a long time. We're very good at predicting what's going to actually happen and what's not. 
But everything that we have today that is known, that is booked, is worked into the guidance that Kevin provided to you. But there is more potential opportunity out there. We may stand up if demand justifies it. We may stand up an additional conversion team or even 2 conversion teams. We've done that in the past. And so we'll just kind of have to follow that as it goes. 
But what we know today is included in the guidance that Kevin has shared with you, but there is still potentially more opportunity there based on what happens with our customers. The key messaging there was just for you all to know that convert merge or M&A is back in the banking space. 
And so that not only is a real positive for us, in that we have customers acquiring other customers, and we generally are paid on account volume and transaction volume, so that's good for us when they get merged in. But then also, for you to be aware, that deconversion revenue will probably go up because we know that some of our customers will also be acquired away from us as M&A continues to grow."

I think just the revenues in the quarter were a tad lighter than what we were modeling. I just -- I'm curious to see where they came in relative to your internal expectations. 
And I know debit volumes sort of rolled off a bit. Is that probably impactful to your Payments segment? And then if you could also comment on what's going on in the bill pay business. I know software trends across the peer group, but if you could just comment on -- if you have any insights on -- is that just more competition from digital wallets, or something else, which is driving bill pay revenue to be flattish?"

So 3 primary components in the Payments line for us or the Payments segment for us: there's bill pay revenue; there's card revenue, debit and credit; and then there is what we refer to as EPS, Enterprise Payment Solutions. 
The bill pay line or the bill pay business continues to be relatively flat. I mean there's some growth, but as we've talked about on the call before, anybody who needs a bill pay solution has a bill pay solution. Volumes aren't really fluctuating that much. So it's relatively flat on the bill pay business. 
The card business is continuing to grow. We're seeing nice growth not only because we're adding customers, but because now, as the pandemic numbers have dropped again here in the early fall, transaction volumes -- we've seen a definite correlation between transaction volumes increasing as infections have -- reported infections have dropped. And so that's a key part. 
But the Enterprise Payments business is continuing to grow very nicely. It's the smallest piece of that segment, but the fastest-growing piece of that segment. And that is driven by Remote Deposit Capture, but also by ACH originations. 
And so we have a number of customers who have signed with that platform recently and some that we'll announce next year, I think, as they come live, that will be continuing to drive big volumes through that platform. So it's the combination of those things that I think are driving the Payments revenue, and all of those are positioned well for continued growth in the coming year."

The core -- it's been interesting watching core deals as we've come out of the real trough of the pandemic. And obviously, the pandemic isn't over, but core deals are really lumpy right now. But there is a tremendous amount of activity as far as that side of the business. 
And then if you look at the rest of the suite at Jack Henry, the forecasts are looking -- or the pipelines are looking very, very strong right now.

I mean, so obviously, travel is going to be a lot higher. So there's other costs there. Our salespeople are getting out and traveling more. So just the travel expense is going to be higher. 
I mean, is it possible that our total margin expense should be higher? Yes. Obviously, the Q1 margins are probably the highest of the year because of all the software subscription revenue that we recognized in Q1 for all the software that's been delivered in the previous years. So this is a high watermark for margins for the year. 
But the other thing I'll say is, Kartik, you know, hardware was down almost 40% this quarter, which was -- that actually helps our margins by hardware revenue being down, which -- I mean, it sounds weird. But if hardware revenue would level out and go back up a little bit for the rest of the year, as I'm sure IBM will come out with additional hardware upgrades, could that impact our margins? Yes. So I mean, I'm still very comfortable that we can hit the 50 bps. And could it be higher than that? Yes. But I'm not -- I'm just not ready to step out on that limb yet."

Well, I'm not exactly sure what you're including in the super app bucket, Dave. I mean there's lots of stuff going on out there. We are working -- so the thing about the Banno platform is it is built to work with -- to be an open API-based platform. So modern technology stack, open API-based platform. You saw -- hopefully, you saw the press release we did in October where we announced the partnership and integration of Finicity, Akoya and Plaid. So all of those relationships are designed to provide greater functionality on this digital platform to connect fintech solutions to other fintech solutions. 
Our goal with the platform is not only to offer the best experience for the consumer and small business through a single digital experience, but also to provide the best platform in the industry to create that interconnectivity of applications to other applications. The other thing that we're trying to do through all of that -- and this is important, when you compare kind of the modern technology stack like we have with Banno as compared to other things that are out there, is we are close to being able to eliminate screen scraping. 
And if you're not -- if you're not familiar with that term of screen scraping, that's what happens with older applications, where a consumer -- let's say you're trying to consolidate all of your accounts on one -- in one experience on one spot, one digital experience. Well, the old approach, which most companies out there are using widely today, is screen scraping, where the consumer provides their credentials, their log on and password into some central location, and that central location goes out and essentially simulates being a consumer going on and pulling down balance information. 
Well, you can probably imagine the security -- potential security and privacy issues that come along with that. And so we've been working very diligently for several years to eliminate all of that in our platforms. And this integration that we've done with Finicity, Akoya and Plaid and the other moves that we've made with our digital platform have us right on the cusp of eliminating all of that well ahead of anybody else, any of our traditional competitors, when it comes to offering a truly state-of-the-art digital experience."

We're signing -- and I have emphasized that many times, signing core takeaways, gaining share on the core side of the business. But a lot of that is driven by all this other outstanding technology that we're delivering and the tight integration that we're doing not just with Jack Henry products to other Jack Henry products, but Jack Henry products to the other things out there in the industry that people want to be able to use, the fintech solutions out there. We are providing that connectivity easily. 
In the press release, again, by -- referring back to the Finicity, Akoya and Plaid release, if you look at the headline, it's 0 cost, 0 lift. So we're doing all that for our customers, 0 cost, 0 lift. Why would you do that? A, it's the right thing to do, but B, in the long run, it's less expensive for us as a provider if our customers will adopt those types of things. All of that thought, all of that approach, all of that philosophy around delivering technology is being recognized in our industry. And Jack Henry is getting credit for it, and customers are moving to our platforms as a result."

And there's very little cost increase because, remember, it's the exact same software. It's the exact same support organization. Our -- we've got the infrastructure in place with our data centers.

So I'll try not to be -- I think you're misunderstanding the dynamic. So you said it yourself, and I'll just repeat that. When we use the term partnership, that doesn't mean that we're reselling somebody else's stuff that we're exchanging revenue, that there's something like that or that we're missing a piece. In this day and age, with all of the new feature function that's happening with fintechs and with the demand that our customers, that bankers have from their customers, their consumers to use different things, different pieces of technology that they've come across, the future for banking and the future for a provider like us is to provide open connectivity so that the customer, our customer, the banker can choose to integrate whatever they want to integrate into our platform. 
What we're moving toward -- what consumers are moving toward is they're very sensitive to the fact that the data is their data. Like I'm the consumer, it's my data. It's not your data, it's my data. And so it happens to be housed at this bank, but I want access to that data. And so the bank is now, more than ever, very sensitive to that idea that they need to provide access to that data in a secure manner to a variety of different sources that the consumer chooses to want to use or that the bank may choose to want to use. 
So we are continuing to innovate on our technology. I mean the reason that the Banno platform is so well regarded and has the highest ratings in the App Store is because we have the best functionality out there. But you can't do everything, right? Every -- not every idea that every fintech comes up, it's just not possible to write all of that code into 1 application. 
And so providing that platform for open connectivity is the best of all worlds. It gives us this reputation of being open and being innovative, but it also provides the banker the opportunity to connect whatever they want to connect into that platform and take advantage of the data for the benefit of their consumer, whether the consumer is an individual or if it's a small business. And so -- what we are doing today is being recognized regularly as being really industry-leading in providing that open connectivity and that opportunity for the banker to choose, as opposed to us going to them and say, ""You must use our platform, whether you like it or not."""

You give me about 1.5 hours, I'll try and fill you in. So no, seriously. So first off, we -- when M&A happens, I'll answer your question from the beginning and work forward, does it happen that customers are acquired away and then they come back to Jack Henry? Yes, that happens. 
And in fact, it's more often than you might think, where somebody gets acquired, the logical thing is for the acquiring institution to convert them to whatever they're running. And then once they get integrated in, the people who have been acquired -- the people who have been acquired suddenly start to say we had it better on the old platform than we have on this new platform. Let us tell you guys what we used to be able to do with Jack Henry. 
And it's oftentimes the combination of the technology and the relationships. This is a relationship business. Partnership is a key part of what we do. And so oftentimes, the acquired institution will educate the acquirer on what it was like to do business with Jack Henry. So we do win those occasionally. 
The other thing that we win once in a while is what -- let's say that an acquirer is targeting one of our institutions. We know that, that's happening. We can oftentimes sell the acquirer on converting to the Jack Henry platform as opposed to the acquirer using whatever it was they had before the acquisition was announced or before the deal was announced. And so those -- we refer to those as win-a-merger and those we've been successful at. 
But kind of the heart of your question, the beginning of your question, was -- that is the power? The beginning of your question -- sorry, we have a little phone issue going on here. The beginning of your question, most of the M&A activity is happening at the low end of the range. So real small institutions being acquired by larger institutions. 
And we don't tend to serve the real small institutions. So that tends to be good for us that, usually, we are the benefactor, one of our institutions acquiring a smaller institution as opposed to ours being acquired away. But to the very beginning of your question, what that means is our asset base among our customers is growing because those larger customers in our base are acquiring smaller customers. And so over time, we will continue to grow as far as average asset size."
