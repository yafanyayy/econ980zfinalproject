Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. 
This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter, and then Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal '21. We will then open it up for your questions. 
It is hard to believe that it's been over a year since the beginning of the mass shutdowns in response to COVID-19. This past year has been different from any other that we've experienced before. New challenges have forced us to find innovative ways to connect with our clients, prospects and our own employees. I'm very proud of how the Paychex team embraced these challenges and took a leadership role throughout this pandemic as evidenced by the newly released Sapient Insights Group annual HR survey just coming out this week that ranked Paychex Flex, our SaaS-based cloud application, #1 among all solution providers as rated by their voice of the customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores. 
Our results for the third quarter reflect strong retention and client-based growth across all of our lines of business, most notably in our ASO HR Outsourcing business. We completed the selling season with strength in our virtual, digital and HR outsourcing sales, driven by new business starts and the increasing need for HR support. 
Our traditional sales channels have been impacted by headwinds arising from restrictions on face-to-face meetings and delayed decision-making by the prospects. However, we've seen growth in key sales metrics, including sales presentations and close rates which have continued in March as well as increases in win rates versus our competitors. We are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as we transition back to a normal market condition. 
As Efrain will discuss in more detail, with less than a quarter remaining in our fiscal year, we are proud of the fact that our total service revenue for the year will be roughly flat to last fiscal year after the major impact of businesses during the pandemic. Our initiatives to reduce expenses while accelerating our investment in the innovation of our products and service delivery has not only maintained our industry-leading profit margins, but has positioned us well for growth as the pandemic situation improves. 
We have delivered solid client growth and demonstrated our unique value to our clients and partners through some of the most difficult times. Throughout every stage of the pandemic, we have demonstrated our commitment to helping clients with our multifaceted approach response, which includes a comprehensive COVID online help center, state-specific resources, educational webinars, product innovations, in-app paycheck protection program tools, specialized employee training and more. Our efforts were recognized not only by our clients in the form of strong client satisfaction scores and retention, but we were also recently honored as a 2021 silver winner of a Stevie Award for the most valuable COVID-19 response. 
We continue to listen to and work with small and midsized businesses to provide the information, resources and support they need. A recent Paycheck survey to these businesses revealed that 3 of the biggest obstacles facing small and midsized business owners are: financial instability, planning the return to office and employer vaccination policies. While financial instability is the biggest concern, the government stimulus plans have been very effective in helping small and midsized businesses stay afloat. Paychex has continued to build on its portfolio of PPP solutions in real-time as new government relations are passed. 
To date, we have assisted our clients in quickly applying for and obtaining over $60 billion in PPP loans. And we have also helped them claim approximately $1.5 billion in paid leave and employee retention tax credits. Paychex Flex is the first HR software solution to introduce integrated tools to help businesses maximize tax credits while not impacting PPP loan forgiveness. 
Our experienced HR professionals help our clients by delivering effective recommendations based on our clients' unique circumstances and business needs. These new challenges include assisting and navigating the complex stimulus legislation, developing return to office plans, creating vaccination policies and the data analytics and tools to support employee recruitment and retention in this difficult time. The complexity of these issues has resulted in higher demand for HR outsourcing as more clients recognize the advantage of putting our expertise to work for them. 
In recent months, this increased demand has contributed to strong growth in our ASO business as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support, but some reluctance to make changes to their employee benefits by selecting the PEO model. We do expect that as businesses begin to evaluate their options and implement benefit decisions, there will be a more normalized mix of ASO and PEO product selection. 
We announced on the last call that we were introducing our new pooled employer plan, or PEP. This new product is a cost-effective retirement plan designed to expand retirement plan access with reduced administration for employers. We have been very pleased with the reception of this new offering in the market. And after just a few short months of approximately 2,000 new clients on PEP. We believe that recent mandates in California requiring retirement benefits for employees will lead to even more interest in our PEP product and other retirement solutions. 
Paychex remains the top record keeper for retirement plans, originating the most new plans annually. We also announced our integration with Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale systems. We offer integrated payroll and time and attendance for small business retailers via a new app in the Clover app market. Integration is now complete and existing Paychex customers can download the app to allow for time and attendance to be handled within the Clover system with seamless integration with Paychex Flex. This integration increases cross-selling opportunities for both companies and significantly enhances the client experience for shared customers. In addition, we launched several enhancements to our data analytics and Paychex Flex, including a diversity and equal pay live report that builds upon our recently released EEO-1 compliance solution to give administrators the ability to analyze their pay and diversity data allowing businesses to uncover opportunities to create a more diverse and equitable workforce. 
Our innovative solutions continue to receive industry recognition. We were recognized by the Business Intelligent Group, earning a 2021 BIG, B-I-G, innovation award for being a leader in real-time payments. And last May, we were the first HR solutions provider to offer real-time payments, giving businesses more freedom and flexibility. I'm very proud of the 2 awards that Paychex has been honored with recently for the 13th time Ethisphere named us one of the world's 2021 world most ethical companies and we are also on the Fortune's list of world's most admired companies. These awards acknowledge our commitment to ethical business practices, values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership as well as our support for the business community and its employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who have continued to show up for our clients even while navigating the challenges of the pandemic in their own lives. 
As we enter our second year with COVID, we remain diligent in helping businesses continue to navigate the pandemic and remain hopeful that the worst is behind us. We are confident that our resilient business model, strong financial position and dedicated employees will help Paychex to finish fiscal year '21 even stronger than we started it. 
I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain?"

In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, et cetera, please refer to our press release, again, and our investor presentation for more information on these measures. 
I will start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, and then I'll follow-up with some greater detail in certain areas, and then I'll wrap with a review of our fiscal 2021 outlook and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2022. 
Our third quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID for the third quarter service revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. As a reminder, our third quarter includes certain annual revenue streams that declined due to lower employment. Total revenue declined 3% to $1.1 billion, impacted by a decline in interest on funds held for clients. 
Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue was even at $847 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 8% to $250 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 29% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were consistent with the prior year. 
Expenses were down 4% to $643 million. The decline in expenses was driven by lower discretionary spending, reduced facilities costs and lower amortization of intangible assets. Operating income was flat at $469 million and reflected an operating margin of 42.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. 
Our effective income tax was 24.2% for the third quarter compared to 23.6% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards. Adjusted net income decreased 1% to $349 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also decreased 1% during the quarter to $0.96 per share. 
Year-to-date, service revenue declined 3% to $3 billion, with Management Solutions revenue declining 1% and PEO and Insurance declining 6%. Interest on funds held for clients declined 27% to $45 million. Total revenue declined 3% to $3 billion. 
Operating income decreased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 2% to $1.1 billion, reflecting a margin of 37.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin excludes onetime cost of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% to $2.32. 
Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. As we've mentioned frequently, we continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios hovered in average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.8% last year. Those were the good days. 
I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments are $1.1 billion and total borrowings were $804 million as of February 28, 2021. Funds held for clients as of the same date, February 28, 2021, were $4.2 billion, an increase from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter. 
Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $82 million as of February 28, 2021, that compares to $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The decrease in net gain position resulted from increases and longer-term yields during the 9-month period. 
Total stockholders' equity was $3 billion as of February 28, reflecting $671 million in dividends paid and $78 million of shares repurchased during the first 9 months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 37%. Cash flows from operations were $871 million for the first 9 months. That was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivables due to continued recovery from COVID-19 pandemic and growth in the business -- the COVID-19 pandemic and growth of the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll-related liabilities. 
Now I'm going to turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. It does not assume any acceleration due to government stimulus, but rather assumes current course and speed of the recovery. Results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. However, uncertainty about the pace of the recovery of the remainder of the year remains. We have provided the following updates to our guidance after seeing the third quarter results. Management Solutions revenue growth year-over-year is expected to be in the range of flat to growth of 2%. We previously guided to a range of decline to 1% to growth of 1%. PEO and Insurance solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance. We're now providing guidance on total service revenues. This is total service revenue, not total revenue, which is now expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. 
Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million to $65 million, and this is unchanged from prior guidance. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a range of a decline of 3% to flat. Adjusted operating income as a percent of total revenue is now anticipated to be in the range of 36% to 37%, up from previous guidance of approximately 36%. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%, up from approximately 41%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, unchanged from previous guidance. 
Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24%, while we previously guided to approximately 24%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4%. Obviously, we need to go through the fourth quarter to see where the year ends, but we're really pleased with our ability to manage through the P&L impacts of the pandemic, especially loss of variable revenue, which, as you all know, carries a high margin. We offset much of that, including a decline in interest on funds held for clients. And if there's any doubt about our ability to manage the P&L., I think that, this year, we showed some of the skeptics on that. 
Now turning to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We currently anticipated total service revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 9%. Remember, I said total service revenue growth. To get total, you need to understand the next one, which is interest on funds held for clients expected to be approximately $15 million, consistent with previous quarters, that is interest on funds held consistent with previous quarters. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sharp rebound from what we've experienced in the first 3 quarters and a return to growth. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%. 
Now we're also currently in the process of preparing our annual plan for fiscal year 2022. So now we'll lead. Others haven't talked about it, we'll talk about it. And wanted to give you some indications of what our thinking is. We'll provide more complete guidance for fiscal 2022 during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter call in June. But I want to provide some very preliminary color on our initial thoughts around fiscal 2022 in this call. 
With those caveats, we believe that total service revenue growth will be in the range of 6% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million and does not assume any significant change in interest rates. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with thinking about the right way to position the portfolio, but this is where we're at right now. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 37%. And that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Let me just say one thing on that. As you know, we typically will exclude our benefits from stock comp exercise. At this point, we're not baking any in. We probably will get some benefit, but too early to call. 
Now if as if that wasn't enough of a caveat, all of these is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we will update you again on the fourth quarter call after we have gone through the fourth quarter. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Marty."

For example, client retention, Marty, you, I think, referred to some delays in sales cycles. Can you kind of walk through the bookings trends you saw in the quarter? 
And then my follow-up is really around the receivables balance, which was up 81% versus the May balance sheet. And perhaps, Efrain, you can talk a little bit more about kind of the purchased accounts receivable. What are the terms around that?"
295368,705366980,2247395,"Paychex, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2021",2021-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Paychex, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Let me talk to that, David. So as many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. At the -- and those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's",252,"Yes. Let me talk to that, David. So as many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. At the -- and those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's call it, April, May and June, basically, staffing was flat on its back. 
What that -- what happened was that we weren't giving any -- providing any lending because there was no lending to be provided to staffing firms. And as a consequence, the receivables balance was very low. Our cash flow was very high in the quarter in the last quarter. What's happened is if that trend persisted through the first -- excuse me, half of the year and then staffing came roaring back starting in January. And in particular, really in the month of February as there was a ramp-up in a number of areas in staffing, including health care. So at the end of the quarter, we had purchased significantly more receivables than we had anticipated when the year started. But on an average basis, we're about -- only about 4%, 5% above where we were last year. So it's a little bit of an artifact of the decline in staffing, followed by a sharp rebound. That number will come down significantly in the fourth quarter. So that's what's happening on receivables. So you had 3 questions there. I think the other ones were retention and then growth."
295368,705366980,2247395,"Paychex, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2021",2021-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Paychex, Inc.","Executives","On the -- David, on the sales side, yes, I think what we felt -- what we've seen is an improvement, particularly toward the end of the quarter.

I know we just continued now into March on sales opportunities, so we're getting in front of clients for presentations. What we've seen throughout the first half of the year and into the selling season was really a lot of no decisions. So we get in front of clients, but they're just not ready to make a move. And so we're starting to see now a little bit of that open up in the last month or so. And so we're getting good opportunities in front of clients. Actually, our win rates where they make a decision, we're doing better against competitors than we have in the past. And sales results kind of year-to-date are pretty much on track for the year as to kind of what we expected. But I think that we're seeing improvements now and things starting to open up. 
One of the tough things that played against that was just not getting more enough face-to-face with clients. Certainly, always put a little bit of a dampening effect on -- particularly on a selling season, where we have so many units that come in that way. The positives have been digital. We increased our marketing and got a lot more digital sales, so coming in over -- through the web, selling telephonically, selling online, so we've seen that, and that's helped -- that's been really helped by new business starts, which are up, I think, double digits year-over-year. And so we're taking advantage of that. 
So everything is improving, but it did have some dampening effect on selling season not getting in front of people. We're now opening that up and getting out with prospects face-to-face as they're comfortable and reps are comfortable, that's starting to pick up. ASO, very strong. HR needs, very strong, as you would expect, just in all the things that I already described. How do I handle -- continue to handle work from home? How do I handle return to office? How do I handle vaccination, whether do I require it or not? So big growth, very strong double-digit growth in ASO. 
But on the PEO side, as I mentioned, a little bit slower because they haven't really wanted to change. You go back to this kind of no decision thing. You haven't seen as many businesses wanting to get into insurance and change their insurance right now or their benefit plans. Given that, that's kind of the least of their concerns. And so we think that will normalize going forward. But very strong in HR performance, HR sales on the ASO side, very strong on the digital side and telephonic sales and starting to pick up on all of the opportunities in win rates. 
On the client retention, on track really for the best retention in our history. We have very strong client retention. Again, I think some of that, certainly, we're getting help from clients saying, hey, I'm getting great value from Paychex with the help on the PPP loans I mentioned. We've helped facilitate through Biz2Credit, our partner and other banks and so forth with our innovation in the Flex product. We've helped facilitate over $60 billion in our clients' clients to get loans from the PPP program. 
And what's really picked up now in the last even few months is employee retention tax credits. We have helped tremendously. That means we go back and refile some of the 941s to help them apply for those credits. And that has taken off very quickly as well. So clients are feeling it's a great time for us to show the complete value of what Paychex's expertise it brings to them, and that has really helped client retention to be extremely strong right now. 
We have the best net client gain. You know we don't give specific numbers on clients until the end of the year, but we had the best net client gain in the third quarter, I think, in our history, at least in the last 4 or 5 years anyway with a combination of the sales and retention."

I think, one, it is indexed a little higher on the hospitality side and particularly on the Oasis acquisition that we did and concentrated in, of course, southern states. And so I think as you see the hospitality come back, the stimulus that are out there now and that are picking up the new grants, in particular, for restaurants and bars, hotels, et cetera, that are out there, they're now -- these grants, not loans but grants, are going to be given out. I think all these things are going to help kind of bring hospitality back. And of course, just the opening up of more states and more restaurants to full either expanded capacity or full capacity, I think will bring that back, and that will drive certainly more of the PEO who tend to go -- those clients tend to go that way. 
The other thing is I just think more comfort in getting their employees back into the business place. Now they're going to be interested in, ""Okay, how do I get employees back? How do I retain them? How do I recruit them?"" Benefit plans are going to become very interesting again for them. And I think the more complexity of those benefit plans and how competitive they are is going to be very important to them. 
So I think the stimulus, the bounce back, the opening and the bounce back in hospitality, which is coming towards the later end of some of the stimulus and the need to have very strong benefit plans, I think we'll start to see the PEO pick back up and a lot of interest from prospects."

It's been harder to get full interest, so I think we've been good about coming back around and selling other products, but I think leading with HR actually was very important during the pandemic, and you can see that in really the double-digit growth that we've seen in the sales of ASO because you could go in and talk -- if we were just going in and pushing payroll first over the last year during the pandemic, I don't think we would have been as successful as that we've been trained to have our salespeople talk about HR and how we can help them completely not just with payroll, and that has really helped us. So I'd say that actually, we stayed with the full HR value. And that was -- has been a lot of our success during the pandemic because that was the real need for our clients and prospects."

And I think selling, going back to the go-to-market of selling HR completely, I think if you went back 2 years, they still saw selling payroll upfront versus our competitors selling an integrated HR and payroll, and the HR focus that we've put the last 2 years has really positioned us very well. 
We've also done more using sales engineers in the mid market to demo the product and have experts demoing the product earlier in the process. And I think that also has shown the full value of Flex. 
And then just on top of it, I just think our employees' response, both in our IT, our product development, our marketing to the COVID and how we've helped clients has really positioned us well versus some of our competitors who are just not as large and as fully capable. When I -- you go back to that number, I mean, we've helped our clients get $60 billion in PPP loans, that was all responding to stimulus like the day it was out or the day after it was out, partnering with Vista Credit and other financial players who could get them the loans quickly. I think clients really saw the strength of a Paychex brand through all the things that we're doing like that. And that has helped us against competitors that, hey, may have been selling technology, but certainly didn't have the compliance over the experience and the wherewithal that our resources have."

But I think we've done a pretty responsible job this year, and I think that we've already started to add back costs actually, back half of the year to normalize our cost structure that next year wouldn't be quite as being an impact as it otherwise would be. So we've taken that into account. 
But I would say this, and I think one of the great lessons of this year for not only for us but for everyone, is that there are pockets of costs that won't come back and that we don't need. And they're not coming back and they're not needed, and they won't be in the P&L. So I think that that's why you see we had -- we exceeded expectations, our own expectations and certainly external expectations on margins. As I said, a lot of the revenue that we were looking at was marginal revenue drop to beat that number. And going into next year, we're expecting to leverage further. 
So I think that we're comfortable with that cost structure moving forward. It does include continued savings from actions that we took this year, but we've added back some costs."

I think that is definitely going to have some retention impacts because we see it in the client satisfaction scores being at an all-time high, great feedback from clients awards that we've won, the health center online that we produced. So I think there will be some stickiness, but we also know that there's just the ability that people are more comfortable, and they will now focus on do I need something else?

Those of you who've followed us for a while know that we tend to err on the side of being a bit conservative in terms of what we say and try not to get over our skis too much. But I would say this, if you look through the first 3 quarters, and Marty mentioned that our net client gain was the highest that certainly it's been in recent memory in the third quarter. If you look through 3 quarters, we're on a pace to really smash our retention records. I mean, significant improvements that, frankly, 9 years ago, I would never have thought was possible. 
But let's leave that to the side. Right now, as we speak, our rate of revenue retention, ignore client retention, is verging on 90-plus percent. That's a number given our client base, which is really pretty extraordinary. So when I looked at those numbers and I say, ""Why is that?"" It's all of those small actions, seemingly small, in helping clients that have driven them to stay with us. Now will we end the year there? I would say, we have to see what happens in the fourth quarter. But we're on record-setting levels from the standpoint of both locking down the client base on units and also in terms of revenue retention through the first 3 quarters of the year. So we're feeling pretty good. We expect some slippage as we get into the summer, that's to be expected. But we've set ourselves up pretty well. So if we can continue to drive benefit from all of the actions that are occurring, and all of the packages that have been released and continue to serve clients well, we're well positioned for next year."

So costs have been very contained, and I would say that's across a wide range of plans that we have.

I think we'll -- like if you think about a lot of the infrastructure going to construction, we benefit from construction when there is more construction, whether it's in homebuilding or road construction or other facilities, everything kind of around that. There's a lot of small business around that small and midsized businesses. And I think definitely, it provides more jobs, and then we'll benefit from that. 
I don't see it directly, but indirectly, I think, certainly, any boost like that to construction, to everything around it will be a positive for us. It's still early to see exactly how that's going to play out and how long it takes to get that money into the economy, but we should be a benefactor of it."

I mean, it's -- we've been in the PEO business for a long time, so that integration made sense. We made sure, at the beginning, when you think back now, almost 2 years, I mean, we had some bumps in the road from a combination of the sales teams and their compensation policies and all that stuff. But we're past that. And I think that we've continued to see good synergies that we expected. Unfortunately, the pandemic obviously put a damper on some of that from a sales perspective, as you can see. And so a little disappointing there. But generally, I think we were on a good -- we were heading on a good path until the pandemic hit now over a year ago. 
I do think there's always still synergies that we can look for there as we combine kind of our traditional -- our PEO business with Oasis, and we continue to do that from a platform perspective, look at the platform, look at the way we're selling, how we sell ASO to both markets and those things. So I think there's still some things there that we can do, but we're very high on the PEO market and the ability of where it's going to come back as we come out of the pandemic. Again, all the things we talked about earlier, a little bit higher index than hospitality in some states and some areas of the states that were hit a little bit harder. I do think we have some opportunity to see that bounce back. 
On M&A, I think we've continued through the pandemic to continue to look at opportunities that we see. So we'll still have the same kind of ideas in mind for that. That can be the PEO business. We're obviously interested in from a product standpoint, if there's things that we need, but we don't see a big need there right now, always looking at payroll HR and anything else that we can do there. In international, we picked up a very -- a small acquisition that we think will add to the product set internationally as well. We did that kind of under the radar, kind of a small one. But we think that could have some impact, too. So yes, we're still very interested in M&A. Obviously, we're in a good position from a cash standpoint if that opportunity comes up. And we'll continue to watch for good valuations that make sense, particularly coming out of the pandemic."

So first, the question you asked, the short answer to the question is the smaller the client, the more the propensity to churn, so that hasn't changed. So we would expect that we'll see a bit more churn as we get into next year, simply because the survival rates on clients that are under for are typically not terrific. But we haven't seen any significant increases in that bucket of clients, and we're certainly handling outselling losses either through SurePayroll or through our virtual sales. So that's been a positive, and we expect that a lot of those trends will continue into next year. 
Will it lock down to the extent? And by locked down, I mean, will we have less churn in the way we've experienced this year going into next year? That's to be seen. I would certainly expect in the first half of the year, we're going to see continued positive news on retention. We'll see what happens in the back half of the year when things start to open up. 
The second thing I'd say is that one of the things that we looked at very closely is in terms of clients who now have taken our HR solutions, how are they churning or not churning in the basin? The short answer to that is they're not. So they see a lot of value in what we're providing. That's a big revenue for us.

COVID, the thing was, how do I deal with, first of all, remote workforces, many of them or closures, how do I deal with all of these rules. As those start to ease, those are the major issues of why I wouldn't be buying HR or payroll or retirement. And I think that as that opens, and the stimulus, frankly, have been a plus. Obviously, they've kept afloat a lot of businesses. We've seen those businesses that we saw as not processing, but in a whole pattern come down dramatically. And I think the stimulus has been a big help. So as more stimulus comes out right now, like these grants to not loans but grants to restaurants, I think that will really stir some more interest in saying, ""Okay, I got employees coming back, I need help from an HR generalist that Paychex provides. How do I bring them back? How do I manage these? How do I manage people? How do I recruit?"" So there's going to be some challenges here in recruiting, retaining, and I think that's going to increase the demand. And as the kind of living day-to-day of COVID starts to ease through the vaccinations and so forth, I think it's going to pick up as our expectation."

But at the same time, we're always ready 7 by 24 by 265 to provide that support, and we found that to be very critical to our clients during the pandemic, in particular. If they get a hung up on something and they need to talk to someone, they don't want to wait for a text back or someone to answer an e-mail or when they can't talk to a live person just like how many of us find software support these days. So it's going to be as good until you need something different, and then it could be a frustration. So I haven't seen the impact yet, but we'll watch it."

Many of those tenured employees that were in the offices that we closed are working from home. So the clients have not seen that disruption from losing their payroll specialists that they've had for many years. We've been able to transition to that work from home environment, which was accelerated by the pandemic. We had already planned on doing some of that over the next few years, but accelerated it. And frankly, my hats off to the technology teams here, the operations leadership that have really done a very good job in making sure that, that continue to be handled. And they've also positioned clients into the right service centers. So if they were normally calling in, we're transitioning them to different service centers that can handle them from that standpoint. So I think we've done a really good job and have not seen a fallout on that. 
On the PEO question, I think, again, it's going to come back to as compliants feel a little bit more things are calm down. Now it's going to be, again, how do I recruit, retain and really make sure I get the employees that I need, while there's still some disruption to the employees. I think even through the summer with child care, with unemployment having an additional higher rate payment to them, so they're going to be interested in, hey, what are the benefit plans that I can offer them? How am I going to be able to provide those benefit plans? Are they good benefit plan? I think the PEO interest will pick back up as we get into the second half of the calendar year and into our next fiscal year, we expect that, that will start to pick back up again."

And it's really an ability of getting the client and the client's employees to see how easy it is to do those things.

And there's no longer a need for that. So as I mentioned, over 80% of changes like direct deposit changes, address changes, things like that are done by the clients or their employees now and we see that continuing. The next -- the movement will continue to be self-service even in sales itself and setting up the client allowing themselves to be set up, much of that is done with SurePayroll now, and that will continue on the Flex platform, where, ""Hey, you're there,"" we're always going to be available to them if they need us, but definitely, there is not only a cost saving, but even probably more important, there's a value to the client that want to do it themselves when they want to do it. And we've been on that track for some time. We just probably haven't talked about it as much from that standpoint.

Look at those awards. That would just say to people look at that, the prevalence of the model, the strength of the model is shown by our retention numbers and the service we were able to deliver to clients. 
I would say this, of course, there's an opportunity for pure software players in the market. But if everyone drops out and provides no service, that's great for us because you know what, we'll be there to catch those clients because a lot of clients, especially in the SME market, need some element of service. So we're not going to run away from that. How we deliver it, that can change. And frankly, over the last since tax reform, many of you know, we made significant investments to accelerate the opportunity. You want a low-end solution where you don't talk to anyone, and you can onboard yourself, by the way. Let's talk about reality, ask our competitors who can do that. We can. Ask them if they can do it end-to-end. I think you're going to get some funny stares on them. My point is we don't seed our tech chops to anyone. We're as good as anyone else.

I -- just following up on Efrain's passionate speech there, I mean, I think we under -- have probably undersold the technology side of us over the years because we're so proud of the service side as well. And when you think about things like the loans, when that stimulus -- when the CARES Act first came out, the next day, we had -- we introduced a product that said, all of your information is prepopulated in Flex. If you're a client of ours, all of your payroll information is in there, you can apply for the loan. And then we shortly said, you can now send your information to Biz2Credit and it will automatically apply. All you have to add is a few things, and we have signature-ready forms for you to fly for forgiveness as well. So I'm very proud of the fact of what our IT and the technology team have done. 
I think we've added those things over the years that we needed. Time and attendance, we bought as a very small add-on product, and they've now turned it into a very large business, growing extremely strong now as part of a revenue stream for us. And we've integrated that into the SaaS cloud-based Flex product. 
The mobile app, as I mentioned a few times, still a 5-star app that is getting increased usage and has a lot of ways to go. So I'm very comfortable. Now we're always looking, probably from an M&A standpoint also or even partnership standpoint like the Clover example. We have the technology. But when you integrate that now with a point-of-sale platform that's best in the business, now you really have some additional power that you're putting the technology. So I've got a point of sale, but boy, now I've got a great time and attendance solution and a payroll solution that's all integrated with seamless connection, that's really powerful. So it's probably more partnership than it is even M&A, but we're always interested in that, but we've built out most of our technology, and we're very proud of it."

It is hard to believe that it's been over a year since the beginning of the mass shutdowns in response to COVID-19. This past year has been different from any other that we've experienced before. New challenges have forced us to find innovative ways to connect with our clients, prospects and our own employees. I'm very proud of how the Paychex team embraced these challenges and took a leadership role throughout this pandemic as evidenced by the newly released Sapient Insights Group annual HR survey just coming out this week that ranked Paychex Flex, our SaaS-based cloud application, #1 among all solution providers as rated by their voice of the customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores.  
Our results for the third quarter reflect strong retention and client-based growth across all of our lines of business, most notably in our ASO HR Outsourcing business. We completed the selling season with strength in our virtual, digital and HR outsourcing sales, driven by new business starts and the increasing need for HR support.  
Our traditional sales channels have been impacted by headwinds arising from restrictions on face-to-face meetings and delayed decision-making by the prospects. However, we've seen growth in key sales metrics, including sales presentations and close rates which have continued in March as well as increases in win rates versus our competitors. We are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as we transition back to a normal market condition.  
As Efrain will discuss in more detail, with less than a quarter remaining in our fiscal year, we are proud of the fact that our total service revenue for the year will be roughly flat to last fiscal year after the major impact of businesses during the pandemic. Our initiatives to reduce expenses while accelerating our investment in the innovation of our products and service delivery has not only maintained our industry-leading profit margins, but has positioned us well for growth as the pandemic situation improves.  
We have delivered solid client growth and demonstrated our unique value to our clients and partners through some of the most difficult times. Throughout every stage of the pandemic, we have demonstrated our commitment to helping clients with our multifaceted approach response, which includes a comprehensive COVID online help center, state-specific resources, educational webinars, product innovations, in-app paycheck protection program tools, specialized employee training and more. Our efforts were recognized not only by our clients in the form of strong client satisfaction scores and retention, but we were also recently honored as a 2021 silver winner of a Stevie Award for the most valuable COVID-19 response. 
We continue to listen to and work with small and midsized businesses to provide the information, resources and support they need. A recent Paychex survey to these businesses revealed that 3 of the biggest obstacles facing small and midsized business owners are: financial instability, planning the return to office and employer vaccination policies. While financial instability is the biggest concern, the government stimulus pay plans have been very effective in helping small and midsized businesses stay afloat. Paychex has continued to build on its portfolio of PPP solutions in real-time as new government relations are passed.  
To date, we have assisted our clients in quickly applying for and obtaining over $60 billion in PPP loans. And we have also helped them claim approximately $1.5 billion in paid leave and employee retention tax credits. Paychex Flex is the first HR software solution to introduce integrated tools to help businesses maximize tax credits while not impacting PPP loan forgiveness.  
Our experienced HR professionals help our clients by delivering effective recommendations based on our clients' unique circumstances and business needs. These new challenges include assisting and navigating the complex stimulus legislation, developing return to office plans, creating vaccination policies and the data analytics and tools to support employee recruitment and retention in this difficult time. The complexity of these issues has resulted in higher demand for HR outsourcing as more clients recognize the advantage of putting our expertise to work for them.  
In recent months, this increased demand has contributed to strong growth in our ASO business as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support, but some reluctance to make changes to their employee benefits by selecting the PEO model. We do expect that as businesses begin to evaluate their options and implement benefit decisions, there will be a more normalized mix of ASO and PEO product selection.  
We announced on the last call that we were introducing our new pooled employer plan, or PEP. This new product is a cost-effective retirement plan designed to expand retirement plan access with reduced administration for employers. We have been very pleased with the reception of this new offering in the market. And after just a few short months of approximately 2,000 new clients on PEP. We believe that recent mandates in California requiring retirement benefits for employees will lead to even more interest in our PEP product and other retirement solutions.  
Paychex remains the top record keeper for retirement plans, originating the most new plans annually. We also announced our integration with Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale systems. We offer integrated payroll and time and attendance for small business retailers via a new app in the Clover app market. Integration is now complete and existing Paychex customers can download the app to allow for time and attendance to to be handled within the Clover system with seamless integration with Paychex Flex. This integration increases cross-selling opportunities for both companies and significantly enhances the client experience for shared customers. In addition, we launched several enhancements to our data analytics and Paychex Flex, including a diversity and equal pay live report that builds upon our recently released EEO-1 compliance solution to give administrators the ability to analyze their pay and diversity data allowing businesses to uncover opportunities to create a more diverse and equitable workforce.  
Our innovative solutions continue to receive industry recognition. We were recognized by the Business Intelligent Group, earning a 2021 BIG, B-I-G, Innovation Award for being a leader in real-time payments. And last May, we were the first HR solutions provider to offer real-time payments, giving businesses more freedom and flexibility. I'm very proud of the 2 awards that Paychex has been honored with recently for the 13th time Ethisphere named us one of the world's 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies and we are also on the Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies. These awards acknowledge our commitment to ethical business practices, values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership as well as our support for the business community and its employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who have continued to show up for our clients even while navigating the challenges of the pandemic in their own lives.  
As we enter our second year with COVID, we remain diligent in helping businesses continue to navigate the pandemic and remain hopeful that the worst is behind us. We are confident that our resilient business model, strong financial position and dedicated employees will help Paychex to finish fiscal year '21 even stronger than we started it.  
I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain?"

You know where to look for those disclosures, and please refer to them. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, et cetera, please refer to our press release, again, and our investor presentation for more information on these measures.  
I will start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, and then I'll follow-up with some greater detail in certain areas, and then I'll wrap with a review of our fiscal 2021 outlook and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2022.  
Our third quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID for the third quarter service revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. As a reminder, our third quarter includes certain annual revenue streams that declined due to lower employment. Total revenue declined 3% to $1.1 billion, impacted by a decline in interest on funds held for clients.  
Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue was even at $847 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 8% to $250 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 29% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were consistent with the prior year.  
Expenses were down 4% to $643 million. The decline in expenses was driven by lower discretionary spending, reduced facilities costs and lower amortization of intangible assets. Operating income was flat at $469 million and reflected an operating margin of 42.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.  
Our effective income tax was 24.2% for the third quarter compared to 23.6% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards. Adjusted net income decreased 1% to $349 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also decreased 1% during the quarter to $0.96 per share.  
Year-to-date, service revenue declined 3% to $3 billion, with Management Solutions revenue declining 1% and PEO and Insurance declining 6%. Interest on funds held for clients declined 27% to $45 million. Total revenue declined 3% to $3 billion.  
Operating income decreased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 2% to $1.1 billion, reflecting a margin of 37.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin excludes onetime cost of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives including the long-term strategy reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% to $2.32.  
Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. As we've mentioned frequently, we continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios hovered in average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.8% last year. Those were the good days.  
I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments are $1.1 billion and total borrowings were $804 million as of February 28, 2021. Funds held for clients as of the same date, February 28, 2021, were $4.2 billion, an increase from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter.  
Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $82 million as of February 28, 2021, that compares to $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The decrease in net gain position resulted from increases and longer-term yields during the 9-month period.  
Total stockholders' equity was $3 billion as of February 28, reflecting $671 million in dividends paid and $78 million of shares repurchased during the first 9 months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 37%. Cash flows from operations were $871 million for the first 9 months. That was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivables due to continued recovery from COVID-19 pandemic and growth in the business -- the COVID-19 pandemic and growth of the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll-related liabilities.  
Now I'm going to turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. It does not assume any acceleration due to government stimulus, but rather assumes current course and speed of the recovery. Results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. However, uncertainty about the pace of the recovery of the remainder of the year remains. We have provided the following updates to our guidance after seeing the third quarter results. Management Solutions revenue growth year-over-year is expected to be in the range of flat to growth of 2%. We previously guided to a range of decline to 1% to growth of 1%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance. We're now providing guidance on total service revenues. This is total service revenue, not total revenue, which is now expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%.  
Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million to $65 million, and this is unchanged from prior guidance. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a range of a decline of 3% to flat. Adjusted operating income as a percent of total revenue is now anticipated to be in the range of 36% to 37%, up from previous guidance of approximately 36%. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%, up from approximately 41%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, unchanged from previous guidance.  
Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24%, while we previously guided to approximately 24%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4%. Obviously, we need to go through the fourth quarter to see where the year ends, but we're really pleased with our ability to manage through the P&L impacts of the pandemic, especially loss of variable revenue, which, as you all know, carries a high margin. We offset much of that, including a decline in interest on funds held for clients. And if there's any doubt about our ability to manage the P&L, I think that, this year, we showed some of the skeptics on that.  
Now turning to the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We currently anticipated total service revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 9%. Remember, I said total service revenue growth. To get total, you need to understand the next one, which is interest on funds held for clients expected to be approximately $15 million, consistent with previous quarters, that is interest on funds held consistent with previous quarters. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sharp rebound from what we've experienced in the first 3 quarters and a return to growth.  
Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%.  
Now we're also currently in the process of preparing our annual plan for fiscal year 2022. So now we'll lead. Others haven't talked about it, we'll talk about it. And wanted to give you some indications of what our thinking is. We'll provide more complete guidance for fiscal 2022 during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter call in June. But I want to provide some very preliminary color on our initial thoughts around fiscal 2022 in this call.  
With those caveats, we believe that total service revenue growth will be in the range of 6% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million and does not assume any significant change in interest rates. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with thinking about the right way to position the portfolio, but this is where we're at right now. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 37%. And that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Let me just say one thing on that. As you know, we typically will exclude our benefits from stock comp exercise. At this point, we're not baking any in. We probably will get some benefit, but too early to call.  
Now if as if that wasn't enough of a caveat, all of these is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we will update you again on the fourth quarter call after we have gone through the fourth quarter. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Marty."

For example, client retention, Marty, you, I think, referred to some delays in sales cycles. Can you kind of walk through the bookings trends you saw in the quarter?  
And then my follow-up is really around the receivables balance, which was up 81% versus the May balance sheet. And perhaps, Efrain, you can talk a little bit more about kind of the purchased accounts receivable. What are the terms around that?"
295368,705366980,2247454,"Paychex, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2021",2021-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Paychex, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Let me talk to that, David. So as many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. At the -- and those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's",252,"Yes. Let me talk to that, David. So as many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. At the -- and those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's call it, April, May and June, basically, staffing was flat on its back. What that -- what happened was that we weren't giving any -- providing any lending because there was no lending to be provided to staffing firms. And as a consequence, the receivables balance was very low. Our cash flow was very high in the quarter in the last quarter. What's happened is if that trend persisted through the first -- excuse me, half of the year and then staffing came roaring back starting in January. 
And in particular, really in the month of February as there was a ramp-up in a number of areas in staffing, including health care. So at the end of the quarter, we had purchased significantly more receivables than we had anticipated when the year started. But on an average basis, we're about -- only about 4%, 5% above where we were last year. So it's a little bit of an artifact of the decline in staffing, followed by a sharp rebound. That number will come down significantly in the fourth quarter. So that's what's happening on receivables. So you had 3 questions there. I think the other ones were retention and then growth."
295368,705366980,2247454,"Paychex, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2021",2021-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Paychex, Inc.","Executives","On the -- David, on the sales side, yes, I think what we felt -- what we've seen is an improvement, particularly toward the end of the quarter.

I know we just continued now into March on sales opportunities, so meaning getting in front of clients for presentations. What we've seen throughout the first half of the year and into the selling season was really a lot of no decisions. So we get in front of clients, but they're just not ready to make a move. And so we're starting to see now a little bit of that open up in the last month or so. And so we're getting good opportunities in front of clients. Actually, our win rates where they make a decision, we're doing better against competitors than we have in the past. And sales results kind of year-to-date are pretty much on track for the year as to kind of what we expected. But I think that we're seeing improvements now and things starting to open up.  
One of the tough things that played against that was just not getting more enough face-to-face with clients. Certainly, always put a little bit of a dampening effect on -- particularly on a selling season, where we have so many units that come in that way. The positives have been digital. We increased our marketing and got a lot more digital sales, so coming in over -- through the web, selling telephonically, selling online, so we've seen that, and that's helped -- that's been really helped by new business starts, which are up, I think, double digits year-over-year. And so we're taking advantage of that.  
So everything is improving, but it did have some dampening effect on selling season not getting in front of people. We're now opening that up and getting out with prospects face-to-face as they're comfortable and reps are comfortable, that's starting to pick up. ASO, very strong. HR needs, very strong, as you would expect, just in all the things that I already described. How do I handle -- continue to handle work from home? How do I handle return to office? How do I handle vaccination, whether do I require it or not? So big growth, very strong double-digit growth in ASO.  
But on the PEO side, as I mentioned, a little bit slower because they haven't really wanted to change. You go back to this kind of no decision thing. You haven't seen as many businesses wanting to get into insurance and change their insurance right now or their benefit plans. Given that, that's kind of the least of their concerns. And so we think that will normalize going forward. But very strong in HR performance, HR sales on the ASO side, very strong on the digital side and telephonic sales and starting to pick up on all of the opportunities in win rates.  
On the client retention, on track really for the best retention in our history. We have very strong client retention. Again, I think some of that, certainly, we're getting help from clients saying, hey, I'm getting great value from Paychex with the help on the PPP loans I mentioned. We've helped facilitate through Biz2Credit, our partner and other banks and so forth with our innovation in the Flex product. We've helped facilitate over $60 billion in our client -- clients to get loans from the PPP program.  
And what's really picked up now in the last even few months is employee retention tax credits. We have helped tremendously. That means we go back and refile some of the 941s to help them apply for those credits. And that has taken off very quickly as well. So clients are feeling it's a great time for us to show the complete value of what Paychex's expertise it brings to them, and that has really helped client retention to be extremely strong right now.  
We have the best net client gain. You know we don't give specific numbers on clients until the end of the year, but we had the best net client gain in the third quarter, I think, in our history, at least in the last 4 or 5 years anyway with a combination of the sales and retention."

I think, one, it is indexed a little higher on the hospitality side and particularly on the Oasis acquisition that we did and it concentrated in, of course, southern states. And then so I think as you see the hospitality come back, the stimulus that are out there now and that are picking up the new grants, in particular, for restaurants and bars, hotels, et cetera, that are out there, they're now -- these grants, not loans but grants, are going to be given out. I think all these things are going to help kind of bring hospitality back. And of course, just the opening up of more states and more restaurants to full either expanded capacity or full capacity, I think will bring that back, and that will drive certainly more of the PEO who tend to go -- those clients tend to go that way.  
The other thing is I just think more comfort in getting their employees back into the business place. Now they're going to be interested in, ""Okay, how do I get employees back? How do I retain them? How do I recruit them?"" Benefit plans are going to become very interesting again for them. And I think the more complexity of those benefit plans and how competitive they are is going to be very important to them. 
So I think the stimulus, the bounce back, the opening and the bounce back in hospitality, which is coming towards the later end of some of the stimulus and the need to have very strong benefit plans, I think we'll start to see the PEO pick back up and a lot of interest from prospects."

I mean, we've gone the last number of years, 2 to 3 years, with really talking about the power of 3,000 sales reps, which is our reps across all divisions. And our traditional model of selling payroll and then coming back in after has changed quite a lot in our go-to-market strategy. We've really seen that we were -- we saw that we were leaving money on the table and value for our clients on the table. So we sell HR complete benefit packages upfront or at least make sure that they're aware of that. And that hasn't changed all that dramatically during the pandemic. 
It's been harder to get full interest, so I think we've been good about coming back around and selling other products, but I think leading with HR actually was very important during the pandemic, and you can see that in really the double-digit growth that we've seen in the sales of ASO because you could go in and talk -- if we were just going in and pushing payroll first over the last year during the pandemic, I don't think we would have been as successful as that we've been trained to have our salespeople talk about HR and how we can help them completely not just with payroll, and that has really helped us.

And I think selling, going back to the go-to-market of selling HR completely, I think if you went back 2 years, they still saw selling payroll upfront versus our competitors selling an integrated HR and payroll, and the HR focus that we've put the last 2 years has really positioned us very well. 
We've also done more using sales engineers in the mid market to demo the product and have experts demoing the product earlier in the process. And I think that also has shown the full value of Flex. 
And then just on top of it, I just think our employees' response, both in our IT, our product development, our marketing to the COVID and how we've helped clients has really positioned us well versus some of our competitors who are just not as large and as fully capable. When I -- you go back to that number, I mean, we've helped our clients get $60 billion in PPP loans, that was all responding to stimulus like the day it was out or the day after it was out, partnering with Vista Credit and other financial players who could get them the loans quickly. I think clients really saw the strength of a Paychex brand through all the things that we're doing like that. And that has helped us against competitors that, hey, may have been selling technology, but certainly didn't have the compliance over the experience and the wherewithal that our resources have."

So yes, it does contemplate that some of the variable costs that came out of the business will go back then, so that's part of our thinking already. But I think we've done a pretty responsible job this year, and I think that we've already started to add back costs actually, back half of the year to normalize our cost structure so that next year wouldn't be quite as being an impact as it otherwise would be. So we've taken that into account. 
But I would say this, and I think one of the great lessons of this year for not only for us but for everyone, is that there are pockets of costs that won't come back and that we don't need. And they're not coming back and they're not needed, and they won't be in the P&L. So I think that that's why you see we had -- we exceeded expectations, our own expectations and certainly external expectations on margins. As I said, a lot of the revenue that we were looking at was marginal revenue drop to beat that number. And going into next year, we're expecting to leverage further. 
So I think that we're comfortable with that cost structure moving forward. It does include continued savings from actions that we took this year, but we've added back some costs."

The other thing that when you change your direct deposit number or address changes, over 80% of those changes are now done by clients or their employees online through the mobile app or on the desktop.

I think that is definitely going to have some retention impacts because we see it in the client satisfaction scores being at an all-time high, great feedback from clients awards that we've won, the help center online that we produced. So I think there will be some stickiness, but we also know that the -- there just -- the ability that people are more comfortable, and they will now focus on do I need something else?

Those of you who've followed us for a while know that we tend to err on the side of being a bit conservative in terms of what we say and try not to get over our skis too much. But I would say this, if you look through the first 3 quarters, and Marty mentioned that our net client gain was the highest that certainly it's been in recent memory in the third quarter. If you look at through 3 quarters, we're on a pace to really smash our retention records. I mean, significant improvements that, frankly, 9 years ago, I would never have thought was possible. 
But let's leave that to the side. Right now, as we speak, our rate of revenue retention, ignore client retention, is verging on 90-plus percent. That's a number given our client base, which is really pretty extraordinary. So when I looked at those numbers and I say, ""Why is that?"" It's all of those small actions, seemingly small, in helping clients that have driven them to stay with us. Now will we end the year there? I would say, we have to see what happens in the fourth quarter. But we're on record-setting levels from the standpoint of both locking down the client base on units and also in terms of revenue retention through the first 3 quarters of the year. So we're feeling pretty good. We expect some slippage as we get into the summer, that's to be expected. But we've set ourselves up pretty well. So if we can continue to drive benefit from all of the actions that are occurring, and all of the packages that have been released and continue to serve clients well, we're well positioned for next year."

So I do think it will have specific retention benefits based on the fact that they'll need support on loan forgiveness that we have automated into the Flex system that makes it easy for them to apply and also for things like the employee retention tax credits, if they have to refile quarterly returns or file them correctly or go back and get data, I think it will certainly help us.

And I think we'll wait for the dust to settle in the fourth quarter, see where that opportunity is and then see how we go after attacking that for now, as Marty's been saying over the last 3 quarters, clients have a desire to get an HR solution in place quickly because of the changing landscape of regulations and our HR specialists have been terrific in guiding clients through that.

I would say, look, it will be good to talk about growth. We've had pockets of growth in the last 3 quarters, but it will be good to resume a period of more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. So that's what we're expecting at this stage."

I mean, it's -- we've been in the PEO business for a long time, so that integration made sense. We made sure, at the beginning, when you think back now, almost 2 years, I mean, we had some bumps in the road from a combination of the sales teams and their compensation policies and all that stuff. But we're past that. And I think that we've continued to see good synergies that we expected. Unfortunately, the pandemic obviously put a damper on some of that from a sales perspective, as you can see. And so a little disappointing there. But generally, I think we were on a good -- we were heading on a good path until the pandemic hit now over a year ago. 
I do think there's always still synergies that we can look for there as we combine kind of our traditional -- our PEO business with Oasis, and we continue to do that from a platform perspective, look at the platform, look at the way we're selling, how we sell ASO to both markets and those things. So I think there's still some things there that we can do, but we're very high on the PEO market and the ability of where it's going to come back as we come out of the pandemic. Again, all the things we talked about earlier, a little bit higher index than hospitality in some states and some areas of the states that were hit a little bit harder. I do think we have some opportunity to see that bounce back. 
On M&A, I think we've continued through the pandemic to continue to look at opportunities that we see. So we'll still have the same kind of ideas in mind for that. That can be the PEO business. We're obviously interested in from a product standpoint, if there's things that we need, but we don't see a big need there right now, always looking at payroll HR and anything else that we can do there. In international, we picked up a very -- a small acquisition that we think will add to the product set internationally as well. We did that kind of under the radar, kind of a small one. But we think that could have some impact, too. So yes, we're still very interested in M&A. Obviously, we're in a good position from a cash standpoint if that opportunity comes up. And we'll continue to watch for good valuations that make sense, particularly coming out of the pandemic."

I'll ask -- I'll answer a question you didn't ask and then I'll answer the question you asked. So first, the question you asked, the short answer to the question is the smaller the client, the more the propensity to churn, so that hasn't changed. So we would expect that we'll see a bit more churn as we get into next year, simply because the survival rates on clients that are under for are typically not terrific. But we haven't seen any significant increases in that bucket of clients, and we're certainly handling outselling losses either through SurePayroll or through our virtual sales. So that's been a positive, and we expect that a lot of those trends will continue into next year. 
Will it lock down to the extent? And by locked down, I mean, will we have less churn in the way we've experienced this year going into next year? That's to be seen. I would certainly expect in the first half of the year, we're going to see continued positive news on retention. We'll see what happens in the back half of the year when things start to open up. 
The second thing I'd say is that one of the things that we looked at very closely is in terms of clients who now have taken our HR solutions, how are they churning or not churning in the basin? The short answer to that is they're not. So they see a lot of value in what we're providing. That's a big revenue for us.

It's very basic. There's not going to be personal support, I don't believe. As we've said, we've moved a lot to self-service. But at the same time, we're always ready 7 by 24 by 365 to provide that support, and we found that to be very critical to our clients during the pandemic, in particular. If they get a hung up on something and they need to talk to someone, they don't want to wait for a text back or someone to answer an e-mail that when they can't talk to a live person just like how many of us find software support these days. So it's going to be as good until you need something different, and then it could be a frustration. So I haven't seen the impact yet, but we'll watch it."

And then the second question is just on the service footprint, just as you cut back on the geography, and it seems like retention is doing extremely well, so it seems like your client satisfaction must be really doing well. But are you seeing any sort of -- are there any negatives with regards to the cut back with regards to the geographic footprint on the service side?"

Many of those tenured employees that were in the offices that we closed are working from home. So the clients have not seen that disruption from losing their payroll specialists that they've had for many years. We've been able to transition to that work from home environment, which was accelerated by the pandemic. We had already planned on doing some of that over the next few years, but accelerated it. And frankly, my hats off to the technology teams here, the operations leadership that have really done a very good job in making sure that, that continue to be handled. And they've also positioned clients into the right service centers. So if they were normally calling in, we're transitioning them to different service centers that can handle them from that standpoint. So I think we've done a really good job and have not seen a fallout on that. 
On the PEO question, I think, again, it's going to come back to as compliance feel a little bit more -- things are calm down. Now it's going to be, again, how do I recruit, retain and really make sure I get the employees that I need, while there's still some disruption to the employees. I think even through the summer with child care, with unemployment having an additional higher rate payment to them, so they're going to be interested in, hey, what are the benefit plans that I can offer them? How am I going to be able to provide those benefit plans? Are they good benefit plan? I think the PEO interest will pick back up as we get into the second half of the calendar year and into our next fiscal year, we expect that, that will start to pick back up again."

It's actually something that innovation we've been on a path for that for some time. And it's really an ability of getting the client and the client's employees to see how easy it is to do those things.

And there's no longer a need for that. So as I mentioned, over 80% of changes like direct deposit changes, address changes, things like that are done by the clients or their employees now and we see that continuing. 
The next -- the movement will continue to be self-service even in sales itself and setting up the client allowing themselves to be set up, much of that is done with SurePayroll now, and that will continue on the Flex platform, where, ""Hey, you're there,"" we're always going to be available to them if they need us, but definitely, there is not only as cost saving, but even probably more important, there's a value to the client that want to do it themselves when they want to do it.

Look at those awards. That would just say to people look at that, the prevalence of the model, the strength of the model is shown by our retention numbers and the service we were able to deliver to clients. 
I would say this, of course, there's an opportunity for pure software players in the market. But if everyone drops out and provides no service, that's great for us because you know what, we'll be there to catch those clients because a lot of clients, especially in the SME market, need some element of service. So we're not going to run away from that. How we deliver it, that can change. And frankly, over the last since tax reform, many of you know, we made significant investments to accelerate the opportunity. You want a low-end solution where you don't talk to anyone, and you can onboard yourself, by the way. Let's talk about reality, ask our competitors who can do that. We can. Ask them if they can do it end-to-end. I think you're going to get some funny stares on them. My point is we don't seed our tech chops to anyone. We're as good as anyone else.

I -- just following up on Efrain's passionate speech there, I mean, I think we under -- have probably undersold the technology side of us over the years because we're so proud of the service side as well. And when you think about things like the loans, when that stimulus -- when the CARES Act first came out, the next day, we had -- we introduced a product that said, all of your information is prepopulated in Flex. If you're a client of ours, all of your payroll information is in there, you can apply for the loan. And then we shortly said, you can now send your information to Biz2Credit and it will automatically apply. All you have to add is a few things, and we have signature-ready forms for you to apply for forgiveness as well. So I'm very proud of the fact of what our IT and the technology team have done. 
I think we've added those things over the years that we needed. Time and attendance, we bought as a very small add-on product, and they've now turned it into a very large business, growing extremely strong now as part of a revenue stream for us. And we've integrated that into the SaaS cloud-based Flex product. 
The mobile app, as I mentioned a few times, still a 5-star app that is getting increased usage and has a lot of ways to go. So I'm very comfortable. Now we're always looking, probably from an M&A standpoint also or even partnership standpoint like the Clover example. We have the technology. But when you integrate that now with a point-of-sale platform that's best in the business, now you really have some additional power that you're putting the technology. So I've got a point of sale, but boy, now I've got a great time and attendance solution and a payroll solution that's all integrated with seamless connection, that's really powerful. So it's probably more partnership than it is even M&A, but we're always interested in that, but we've built out most of our technology, and we're very proud of it."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. 
This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. 
I will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2022, and then we'll open it up for your questions. 
Before I comment on our results, I just want to take a moment to note that Paychex is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We are proud of our 50 years of innovation in support of small and medium-sized businesses from the payroll services provided to our first client in 1971 to the critical care we gave our clients through the unprecedented pandemic environment over the last 15 months. We are excited to continue to build on this legacy of technology-enabled service that keeps it simple for our clients and gives them the freedom to succeed in their businesses. 
Fiscal 2021 presented one of the most challenging periods in our history. Yet, our commitment to servicing our clients with innovative products made it a very successful year. We finished the year reporting positive growth of 1% for both service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the midst of a pandemic, with almost 15,000 employees working remotely. 
The results of the past year are a testament to our resilient business model and the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who made sure that our clients were well informed and had the technology, products and resources needed during this challenging time, many times for the actual survival of our clients' businesses. 
We achieved record fourth quarter revenue and earnings, and we began to see positive -- as we began to see positive macroeconomic impacts from the economic stimulus and an increase in vaccinations that have allowed businesses to reopen and begin adding employees. This was evident in our check volume trends, our increase in time and attendance activity and strong sequential growth in both PEO and ASO worksite employees. 
We ended the year with 4% growth in our payroll client base, the highest organic growth rate we have seen in a number of years. This was driven by both solid sales performance and a record level of client retention of approximately 85% of our beginning client base. We also grew total worksite employees 18% to 1.7 million. We achieved growth in total sales revenue for the year, quite an accomplishment given the impact of the pandemic on the business environment and with all of our sales teams selling virtually. 
Throughout fiscal 2021, we have seen strength in our virtual sales, retirement services and HR Solutions, all of which experienced double-digit growth for the year. This growth was fueled by a record high fourth quarter in new sales revenue. These positive results, coupled with signs of continuing momentum in sales lead generation and nurturing campaigns, leaves us well positioned for a strong sales year in fiscal '22. 
Our unique combination of innovative products and service are designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and their employees. The strength of our technology backed by our HR and compliance expertise and personalized service continues to be recognized by industry experts. 
The Sapient Insights Group annual HR survey ranked Paychex Flex #1 among all solution providers as rated by their Voice of the Customer Report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores. In addition, Lighthouse Research & Advisory announced Paychex Flex won its second annual HR Tech Award for the best small and medium business focused solution in the core HR workforce category. We were recognized for the strength of our technology and service and providing support to our clients during the pandemic. In particular, our ongoing federal stimulus support, HR services team and digital communication solutions have proven valuable during this challenging time. 
Looking ahead, there will be continued challenges for employers as Americans continue to get vaccinated, state restrictions relax and businesses fully reopened. The war for talent has intensified, and we are well positioned with our fully integrated Flex recruiting and applicant tracking module, and our partnership and integration with indeed the world's largest job board to help businesses find, hire, engage and retain employees quickly and easily. 
Recently, we released additional self-service capabilities, which accelerate the speed to hire and lessen the administrative burden on businesses. This tool simplifies the experience and includes the ability to invite the new hire to onboard in complete documentation digitally. We are in the early days, but reception of this tool has been very positive. Since its release, 80% of the transactions in this new solution have been completed using a mobile device, reflecting on the strength of our mobile and self-service capabilities. 
Retaining talent in today's environment requires a comprehensive benefits package. The latest innovation in our retirement services offering, our pooled employer plan has quickly surpassed 4,000 clients since our January release, just a few months ago, with strong activity in the pipeline. 
Managing cash flow and labor expenses continues to be important as the economy ramps up. The new Paychex Flex labor cost hub gives clients a holistic real-time view of total job costing and labor distribution expenses to drive greater insights to manage their workforce. This is in addition to our suite of data analytics capabilities that provide our clients with advanced features typically reserve for larger companies. And we continue to update our Paycheck Protection Program solutions in near real-time and allow clients to easily navigate the complexities of the PPP and employee retention tax credit concurrently. By quickly developing and deploying these updates in Paychex Flex, we have helped our clients secure over $65 billion in payroll protection loans and $2.5 billion in employee retention and paid sick leave credits combined. 
I'd also like to provide updates on a few other areas where we continue to invest. Near the end of fiscal 2020, we launched our real-time payment solution. And since then, it processed over 50,000 payrolls, funding over $200 million to client employees. This provides clients the ability to process their payroll on check date and fund direct deposit transactions within 15 seconds, a true cash management opportunity for businesses of all sizes. 
Our Paychex Flex intelligence engine, our AI and machine learning chatbot, is now trained to successfully answer over 340 questions while also providing users access to our help center inventory of 800 instructional and educational materials. This past fiscal year, our automated health solutions have serviced approximately 1.8 million client and employee users, handling over 60% of the questions in an automated fashion. And we have seen double-digit increases in the number of sessions in our 5-star Paychex Flex mobile app, and the use of our self-service functionality continues to grow. 
just 2 weeks ago, we hosted thousands of clients at our first ever exclusive virtual Paychex Business Conference. We brought together experts, insights, resources and solutions that clients need to build a better workplace, increase productivity and thrive in 2021 and beyond. It was an important way to thank our clients for their tremendous loyalty as reflected in our historic levels of client retention. 
The post-pandemic future of work is still evolving. We remain focused on helping our clients adapt. Near term, this includes PPP forgiveness, employee retention tax credits, rebuilding workforces and managing the return-to-work environment. 
While we are very proud of the performance during fiscal 2021, we are even more excited about how well positioned we are for growth in fiscal '22. The combination of our sales momentum, client-based growth and satisfaction, industry-leading operating margin and increased investment in our marketing lead generation and product development has us well positioned for another year of strong financial performance in fiscal 2022. 
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as our guidance in fiscal '22. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that has all of the disclosure on these issues. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please again refer to our press release for more information on these measures. 
Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. I'll then follow up greater detail in certain areas, and I'll discuss our full year fiscal 2021 results. 
For the fourth quarter, it was strong. What can you say? Total revenue increased 12% to $1 billion, and service revenue increased 14% to $1 billion. As we benefited from improved employment levels and higher client counts across all of our solutions, growth rates were bolstered by an easier compared to the prior year fourth quarter that was significantly impacted by the pandemic. And remember, last year, we had a fairly strong quarter in terms of interest on funds held for clients. We're battling that headwind and delivered the results that you see. 
Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to $756 million, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 13% to $258 million. Interest on funds held, as I just mentioned, decreased 43% as the lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. 
Expenses increased 10% to $675 million. The growth was -- the growth in expenses was driven by higher performance-based comp, which compared to a prior quarter that reflected a sharp decline due to the pandemic and higher PEO direct insurance costs. 
Operating income increased 18% to $354 million, with an operating margin of 34.4%, 160 basis point improvement from the prior year fourth quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 24% for the fourth quarter compared to 24.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards, and we do call those out. 
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 18% for the fourth quarter to $261 million and $0.72 per share, respectively. 
Let me touch quickly on full year results. Service revenues, as Marty indicated, increased 1% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 2%, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 2%. Interest on funds declined 32% to $59 million due to lower average interest rates. And realized gains and total revenue was flat year-over-year at $4.1 billion. Operating income was flat year-over-year at $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 2% to $1.5 billion with a margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin excludes onetime costs of $32 million related to the acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy. 
To reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the fourth -- the first quarter, I should say, as you know. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $3.04. 
Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio now has an average yield of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% and 1.2% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, respectively, down from the 1.5% and 1.8% for the same period last year. 
Financial position. I'll walk you through our -- the highlights of our financial position. It obviously remains pretty strong. I'd say very strong since we have over $1.1 billion with total borrowings of $805 million as of May 31, 2021. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, an increase from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. As you know, they vary widely on a day-to-day basis, and they averaged $4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.9 billion for the fiscal year. 
Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $79 million as of May 31, 2021, compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. This decrease in net gain position resulted from increases in longer-term yields during the year. 
Stockholders' equity was $2.9 billion as of May 31, 2021, and reflected $909 million in dividends paid and $156 million of shares repurchased. Our return for equity for the past 12 months was 38%. 
Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for the fiscal year. That actually was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease, though, was driven by fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivable due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We just simply didn't purchase a lot of receivables last year in the same quarter, and it also was influenced by the growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll-related liability. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macroeconomic environment, which continues to show gradual recovery. Our outlook will be as follows. Let me just make this comment before we do that. One of the things that we're really proud of is if you go back to what we said in April of last year before we knew everything that we know now, we got some things wrong, but we got a lot of things right, and we also -- we're very, very transparent with the investment community around what we expected to happen. I think if you look at what happened in the year, we were a lot more wrong than -- a lot more right than wrong. There were things that we couldn't have pegged, which was the speed of the recovery, the sharpness of it. We got the direction. We got the shape of it correctly. We knew the year hinge on the fourth quarter being better. We looked at the macroeconomic data and thought that what happened in fourth quarter would happen, and it was stronger than we expected. But the point I want to make is simply that we communicated along all of those steps, and we did it in a very transparent fashion. We didn't say we didn't know. We told you what we knew. We told you what we didn't know, and this is where we ended. 
So with that, in the spirit of those comments, here's where we're landing for '22. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be even with this year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 38%, an increase of approximately 120 basis points. 
Let me pause on that. If you look at what happened just happened, I would say we are among the few companies that not only grew margins in the middle of a pandemic but then raise them in the following year, and that's a result of a lot of hard work here, not only in IT, but also in services and -- across the entire organization. A lot of the initiatives that we took are paying dividend going into next year, and we have more than we can do. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be, again, approximately 42%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We will have some benefit from stock comp exercises. We don't know what that is, so we don't peg it into the guidance. 
Given the shape of the recovery during fiscal 2021, we expect fiscal 2022 to have stronger growth in the first half of the year and then moderate in the second half. The first half of the year is anticipated to have total revenue growth in the high single digits and an adjusted operating margin in the range of 37% to 38%. 
To give you some more color on expectations for the first quarter. We anticipate strong year-over-year growth as the fiscal 2021 first quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the low double digits. I'd say it's probably in the 11% to 13% range, but certainly low double digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we'll update you again on the first quarter call. 
And then just final comment as we wrap up the prepared remarks. I'd just say this, that when the pandemic started, I feel that a lot of calls from investors and analysts about how we would fare in the pandemic. I think this quarter shows how we fared in the pandemic. We are a very, very resilient business. And even during a downturn that no one expected, we did some things that were pretty extraordinary. We take pride in that. That was the work of every single employee in Paychex from sales to ops, to IT, et cetera. And you know what, as Marty said, we think the best is yet to come. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Marty."

So with an anomaly in the fourth quarter of last year, staffing was down 20%. Those of you who cover staffing firms know that. When staffing declines at that level, then there's simply no -- nothing to fund. There's no receivables to fund. And so if you look at last year, our cash flow was $1.44 billion. That is -- that was much higher than even I expected, but that's because we didn't put out any money to fund staffing. This year, we had a really sharp rebound in the first -- in the back half of the year and in the fourth quarter, and that was a very good performer for us, but that means that we purchase more receivables. We get, obviously, some benefit from doing that. The way it's reflected in the statement of cash flows is that, that shows the growth in receivables. So I would say those numbers are now more normalized versus a year last year that was artificially depressed."

So kudos to the team that did that. 
I think that we continue to evaluate what the right footprint is. There's no additional charges contemplated. But as we examine that footprint, we're looking for ways to become more efficient. That's number one. 
Number two, one of the things that a pandemic produces is it produces a keen focus on every single line of expense in the P&L. And I would say that for a company like ours, that is built on the idea that we have to operate very efficiently. We looked at it and said not every single dollar of cost that was in the model prepandemic needs to be in the model post pandemic. And so we thought we could comfortably manage with a slightly different level of expenses. And so the expense growth did not match the revenue growth. 
So the third thing is a sharp rebound in revenue then produces the ability to leverage further than you would if those costs came in or you didn't have that level of revenue growth. 
I would say this, I get the question many, many times, what's the theoretical max for how our margins can grow? The short answer is that -- we don't have an answer on that. But obviously, there is a theoretical max. But the point is that increasingly, we are -- we look for more and more operating efficiencies as our systems get better and better, and they have gotten better and better. And our operating model has gotten more and more efficient. So it's really a combination of all of those. It's sustainable, and all of those things are influencing that number."

It's been impressive this year, obviously, impressive in the quarter. And I think you also mentioned there was a bunch of drivers there, whether it's product, service levels, blocking and tackling, et cetera. But can you also call out a couple of things there that have really made the difference? And then maybe also just tack on there. Has the PPP -- your servicing in terms of the PPP loans made a difference there. Are your clients sort of locked in a little more now because they have to unwind all that process? Or is that big enough to move the needle in your business?"

I think clients learned that there was a great value -- more value than they maybe have thought in having us and the experts -- the expertise that we have with compliance and so forth. The ability to be able to provide them access to those PPP loans, the day they were available and giving them a prepopulated kind of an application that they could file for the loan, a prepopulated application that was signature-ready for the forgiveness, the ability that we linked with 3 fintech providers to help them facilitate loans and -- when they couldn't get some -- the interest from the banks was really very helpful, and I think that has contributed a lot. They're at a stage now where -- and they're still finding that with the employee retention tax credit, we're doing a tremendous service to them by helping them understand that there even is an employee retention tax credit and how big that can be to support them from a cash flow perspective. So I think all of those things in addition to the strength of the product and the service already has really contributed to people saying, hey, I'm not going to leave to save a 10% or a free month of service when I see the benefits that Paychex and the team have provided me."

I think that the way we have pegged our plans is that, again, we expect in the second half of the year a return to more normal unemployment rates. The first half will still continue to be impacted by what we see, which many of you know is difficulty in hiring. SMB is struggling to fill physicians. I would say that this forecast that we have does not assume even that we're at the same level of checks per payroll or pays per control that we were prepandemic [indiscernible] through next year. If we get to that point, that would be upside to this model, but that's not what we're expecting. We obviously believe it will improve.

I think they're up 70% year-to-date over last year brand-new business start-ups. And I think that we've done a very good job of capturing those through the products that we have, both Flex and SurePayroll. SurePayroll had a very -- has had a very strong year and as well, and especially at the beginning of the year, where they picked up a lot of work-at-home kind of nanny payrolls and things like that. Flex also picked up a lot of new start-up businesses of various sizes, and I think that we expect that to continue. I think a lot of it has been the self-service, the way we -- the marketing we've done to get the web leads and then be able to respond to them very quickly, even virtually, and from home and from our virtual sales forces and then the amount of self-service that clients can do that they're looking for to now on a brand new business. So it has definitely continued. We expect it to continue, and I think we performed very well from a close rate perspective."

We're starting to see that pick up now as we transition into the new fiscal year, I think, as they're seeing more need for some of the products and services as they try to hire back and build their teams back up. And so we're definitely, I think, saw it there. 
Retirement and HR was very strong. Retirement was very weak in the first quarter, as you'd expect, going through the beginning of the pandemic. People weren't talking about retirement. We shifted some of those resources toward HR outsourcing. They did a great job. Then as we saw more interest in retirement, they shifted back. We introduced the Pooled Employer Plan in January, as I mentioned. That took off, and there's been a very strong need for the Pooled Employer Plan that has really helped support retirement. But retirement, ASO, in particular, HR outsourcing under the ASO model. PEO has been good. It hasn't been as strong as the insurance needs and changes, I think, will come along now as people are looking for comprehensive benefit packages to retain and attract employees. But HR outsourcing, retirement certainly SurePayroll, all were very strong."

It's probably behind us as a drag, but it's not behind us in terms of growth that isn't really strong. 
I would say one thing that was quite interesting about the quarter was that health and benefits, which we still do a fair amount of sales in the under 50 space, had a strong quarter. So there's interesting pockets of demand in the economy above and below 50, and there seems to be a pretty strong demand still for insurance -- health and benefits insurance for -- in the under 50 space, in addition, obviously, PEO. This is -- now I'm talking more stand-alone health and benefit. So in summary, going into next year, we think PEO is going to grow a bit faster than the insurance part."

We were already in virtual sales and lead generation and nurturing programs over the -- particularly over the last few years, and that has continued to grow for us as well as Flex and SurePayroll. And there's a lot more self-service now capabilities that we've introduced as well. So not only can you research, demo and decide to buy the product, you can do a lot more of it self-service, not only through buying the product, depending on your size, but then a salesperson can jump in and help you anywhere along the way, and people want to do things more themselves. 
Then as I think I've mentioned in my earlier comments that we're introducing more self-service to where the -- once you onboard a new employee, they can do their own self-service setup and everything. And this is helping a lot of clients. They're used to doing things online. They're used to doing it on a mobile phone. And of course, we've been developing all of our products, mobile-first design so that it's built for the mobile phone years ago, and that has continued to pay off. 
A lot of the investments we made in self-service and in technology over the last few years really paid off during the pandemic from a standpoint of clients being able to go online and buy and self-serve and set up, and our self-service has picked up dramatically. For existing clients, for example, an employee do it -- changing their own direct deposit, bank account, changing their address, over 80% of those last year were done by the client or the employee now self-service, most of them on mobile on our mobile app. So things have changed and they were -- they sped up during the pandemic, and I think they'll continue to do that."

Bryan, the other thing I'd add is our marketing group has really done a great job in terms of identifying sources of leads and optimizing our models so that our dollars are really efficiently spend on the web. But the point you make is a very good one. I think that we've evolved into a world where there is much more digital sales, digital capability. And when you're in front of the client, it frequently is going to be in a hybrid model. It was interesting to hear some of our top salespeople basically -- some of the really high-dollar producers talk about how they were able to pivot in a hybrid fashion to sell when they hadn't done it before, and I think that it's the way of the future. The positive on that, I would say, is that, obviously, we can get more efficient in terms of our dollar spent. But there's an offset to that because you have to spend more on digital marketing. There's no way to avoid it. 
One of the things that we're very, very proud of this year is if you look at us, look at what we did from the beginning of the pandemic, we did our first TV advertising. We increased our marketing spend. We didn't decrease it this year. So -- but that's going to be more of a permanent feature of the way the business operates."

I think the biggest one that is, of course, the HR outsourcing. That's had double-digit growth from the ASO model. I think clients realized in a year, particularly with the pandemic that they had so many questions on how to handle remote workforces. How do you handle vaccine policy? How do you handle -- how you're going to -- flexible work schedules, things that they've never addressed before, we saw great demand for HR at all sizes of clients -- and how to handle federal and state regulation. So I think we opened up a whole number of clients who hadn't thought that they needed it maybe to realize that there's a lot of ongoing support that they could gain from HR services. 
Now we have over 600 HR specialists across the country that provided some great expertise even remotely to these clients and a huge compliance team behind them in legal and marketing that would take the rules and regulations coming out of the Fed and the state governments, boil those down, make them understandable and train our HRGs who then train those clients on how to handle it. And I think that's not going to go backwards. I think for -- especially even for the next year, now the issue is how do I hire someone? How do I retain them? How do I how do I keep them in my company with career pathing and development? And how do I use our products like data analytics that would show you this is what the pay might -- you might want to pay someone. This is how you might want to handle their development and do it all, by the way, remotely through our Flex app and paperless onboarding and so forth. I think that's going to be the biggest demand and growth besides retirement and time and attendance and, of course, insurances. 
And even beyond that, of course, there's merchant services that we sell through partnerships. There's going to be pay-on-demand options that we already offer that will continue to grow, all of those things. There's a tremendous -- once they see the value that we have -- that we can provide them, I think there's tremendous upside in the penetration."

We are seeing it as a very big challenge for our clients, and that's providing some opportunities through, again, the employee retention tax credit and telling them how we can help them get dollars there that will help not only retain their employees, but they could use some of those dollars toward hiring, too. You're seeing a lot of upfront bonuses and things like that, that clients have never even considered before that we're helping advise them might be a good trend to start."

I think on the mid-market, the fourth quarter saw a good increase. And we looked at it over even 19 because it was a tough compare or an easy compare, I guess, I'd say, last year because there wasn't as much activity in the fourth quarter. We looked at it over 19, and we're up in the mid-market over prepandemic levels. And in total, our par number hit a 5-year high on the most -- on the overall par that we sold. So we feel good, really kind of across the board, mid-market, more coming in the last quarter and as we start this year, but fully staffed and ready to go and really seeing -- now they're really trained on how to sell from home. And now, of course, the visits are opening back up. We're getting back out to the referral channels, the CPAs and the current clients. 
We've also introduced some technology last year on the client side that helped us mostly on the sub-20 or on the under 20, I guess, I'd say, a -- an automated referral network that we introduced through the marketing team and the sales team, which tells clients, hey, here's how far you are from free payroll or from other things that you can get by turning in one more referral, and it's very easy to do. So we've used some technology to pick up on the referrals as well and get better leads in -- an addition to the normal methods."

Andrew, I think the PEO side, we saw coming on stronger toward the end of the year. I think, again, the big challenge out there now for businesses is hiring and retaining employees and a benefits package and a very solid benefits package and easy to enroll is all -- is going to become part of all of that package that you're trying to get to attract employees and keep them. So we do see insurance picking up some. Now we can provide insurance through the agency directly or through the PEO, but -- and you're also seeing Texas and Florida picking up speed as well as you'd expect since they've been pretty open. But again, it's a challenge to find people, although it's a little easier to find them there, in those 2 states, frankly, than in other areas of the state. So I think PEO will pick up some. It's just been slower to pick up because the focus has been more on the HR need. Now the HR need  being how do I handle things like I mentioned, like vaccination policy, people working from home, new flexible schedules. Now it'll -- it's shifting to not only that, but also how do I hire and retain in a really tough market to find people. And I think one of those things is going to be benefits in insurance."

That schools are still kind of -- and day cares are open or partially open, but they're maybe going now to summer schedules as well. And I think people are just kind of playing it kind of careful to come back. And there's cash account, bank accounts, whether you're in the market or not, if you're in the market, the market's way up and you're feeling pretty confident of your financial position. If you're not in the market, but you have stimulus payments, you've still got some of the highest cash accounts, I think if you look at the stats across the country that we've had in years. So people are feeling like they've got some financial wherewithal, at least temporarily, to probably get through the next couple of months. And then I think, honestly, it's going to open up pretty drastically in the fall would be my take because the unemployment is going to come back down as well as the rules of looking for work. The schools should be back open full, hopefully, and day cares. I think even more will be known, obviously, about COVID and the impacts of vaccinations. Hopefully, vaccinations are up strongly as well. By all those, now you start to get the September, October, I think things are going to open and people are going to be getting back to work as cash accounts start drifting down a little bit."

And part of the way some of those investments were structured were that we would accept higher IT spending in exchange for efficiencies in other parts of the organization. I think that what you've seen is on the operations side, significant efficiencies, and the team has done a great job of of leveraging the investments we've made. I'd say [ that's the one ]. 
I think the second part is simply that when -- I mentioned earlier is when you go through one of these experiences, there's some geographic optimization, that helped, but you also look at what extent you actually need and you realize you don't need 100 cents on the dollar, maybe you need $0.99.

I think we've done extremely well there from holding on to clients. The sales have also -- I think we're picking up much more from an HR perspective. 
A couple of years ago, we started selling really not from just a payroll perspective, but from an HR perspective because we saw we were leaving value on the table for what the client really needed. And I think that has helped us a tremendous amount, too, for a client to say, hey, I'm not just looking for payroll. I'm looking for an HR need. And when you sell the HR need, it has time and attendance, which then leads to the payroll, and it's a total package. So I think we've seen a nice pickup from the way we sell, the way we market.

I mean we have gotten much more sophisticated in the marketing and making the leads that we're getting much more efficient for the sales teams to be able to go out and sell.

Having said that, our model is -- we take clients at all levels. And as Marty mentioned, the first half, the mid-market was more challenging because of driving everyone to virtual, and then we had strength as we came out of the year. I think we've optimized our model to produce margins that are really pretty impressive even when the clients are small. I think that, for example, a SurePayroll client has a surprisingly high level of lifetime value in part because they're being onboarded onto a platform that's optimized for that size of the client. 
And so when we look at the portfolio, we're looking at everything from very low end clients to higher end clients and trying to get the mix right. We feel comfortable that we've got that right and that next year, maybe you'll skew a little bit less to the small and a little bit bigger. So average client side maybe has a chance to tick up. But despite all of that, despite all of that, we had a good year overall from a client growth standpoint."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.  
This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July.  
This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.  
I will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2022, and then we'll open it up for your questions.  
Before I comment on our results, I just want to take a moment to note that Paychex is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We are proud of our 50 years of innovation in support of small and medium-sized businesses from the payroll services provided to our first client in 1971 to the critical care we gave our clients through the unprecedented pandemic environment over the last 15 months. We are excited to continue to build on this legacy of technology-enabled service that keeps it simple for our clients and gives them the freedom to succeed in their businesses.  
Fiscal 2021 presented one of the most challenging periods in our history. Yet, our commitment to servicing our clients with innovative products made it a very successful year. We finished the year reporting positive growth of 1% for both service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the midst of a pandemic, with almost 15,000 employees working remotely.  
The results of the past year are a testament to our resilient business model and the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who made sure that our clients were well informed and had the technology, products and resources needed during this challenging time, many times for the actual survival of our clients' businesses.  
We achieved record fourth quarter revenue and earnings, and we began to see positive -- as we began to see positive macroeconomic impacts from the economic stimulus and an increase in vaccinations that have allowed businesses to reopen and begin adding employees. This was evident in our check volume trends, our increase in time and attendance activity and strong sequential growth in both PEO and ASO worksite employees.  
We ended the year with 4% growth in our payroll client base, the highest organic growth rate we have seen in a number of years. This was driven by both solid sales performance and a record level of client retention of approximately 85% of our beginning client base. We also grew total worksite employees 18% to 1.7 million. We achieved growth in total sales revenue for the year, quite an accomplishment given the impact of the pandemic on the business environment and with all of our sales teams selling virtually.  
Throughout fiscal 2021, we have seen strength in our virtual sales, retirement services and HR Solutions, all of which experienced double-digit growth for the year. This growth was fueled by a record high fourth quarter in new sales revenue. These positive results, coupled with signs of continuing momentum in sales lead generation and nurturing campaigns, leaves us well positioned for a strong sales year in fiscal '22.  
Our unique combination of innovative products and service are designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and their employees. The strength of our technology backed by our HR and compliance expertise and personalized service continues to be recognized by industry experts.  
The Sapient Insights Group annual HR survey ranked Paychex Flex #1 among all solution providers as rated by their Voice of the Customer Report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores. In addition, Lighthouse Research & Advisory announced Paychex Flex won its second annual HR Tech Award for the best small and medium business focused solution in the core HR workforce category. We were recognized for the strength of our technology and service and providing support to our clients during the pandemic. In particular, our ongoing federal stimulus support, HR services team and digital communication solutions have proven valuable during this challenging time.  
Looking ahead, there will be continued challenges for employers as Americans continue to get vaccinated, state restrictions relax and businesses fully reopened. The war for talent has intensified, and we are well positioned with our fully integrated Flex recruiting and applicant tracking module, and our partnership and integration with Indeed the world's largest job board to help businesses find, hire, engage and retain employees quickly and easily.  
Recently, we released additional self-service capabilities, which accelerate the speed to hire and lessen the administrative burden on businesses. This tool simplifies the experience and includes the ability to invite the new hire to onboard in complete documentation digitally. We are in the early days, but reception of this tool has been very positive. Since its release, 80% of the transactions in this new solution have been completed using a mobile device, reflecting on the strength of our mobile and self-service capabilities.  
Retaining talent in today's environment requires a comprehensive benefits package. The latest innovation in our retirement services offering, our pooled employer plan has quickly surpassed 4,000 clients since our January release just a few months ago, with strong activity in the pipeline.  
Managing cash flow and labor expenses continues to be important as the economy ramps up. The new Paychex Flex labor cost hub gives clients a holistic real-time view of total job costing and labor distribution expenses to drive greater insights to manage their workforce. This is in addition to our suite of data analytics capabilities that provide our clients with advanced features typically reserve for larger companies. And we continue to update our Paycheck Protection Program solutions in near real-time and allow clients to easily navigate the complexities of the PPP and employee retention tax credit concurrently. By quickly developing and deploying these updates in Paychex Flex, we have helped our clients secure over $65 billion in payroll protection loans and $2.5 billion in employee retention and paid sick leave credits combined.  
I'd also like to provide updates on a few other areas where we continue to invest. Near the end of fiscal 2020, we launched our real-time payment solution. And since then, it processed over 50,000 payrolls, funding over $200 million to client employees. This provides clients the ability to process their payroll on check date and fund direct deposit transactions within 15 seconds, a true cash management opportunity for businesses of all sizes.  
Our Paychex Flex intelligence engine, our AI and machine learning chatbot, is now trained to successfully answer over 340 questions while also providing users access to our help center inventory of 800 instructional and educational materials. This past fiscal year, our automated help solutions have serviced approximately 1.8 million client and employee users, handling over 60% of the questions in an automated fashion. And we have seen double-digit increases in the number of sessions in our 5-star Paychex Flex mobile app and the use of our self-service functionality continues to grow.  
Just 2 weeks ago, we hosted thousands of clients at our first ever exclusive virtual Paychex Business Conference. We brought together experts, insights, resources and solutions that clients need to build a better workplace, increase productivity and thrive in 2021 and beyond. It was an important way to thank our clients for their tremendous loyalty as reflected in our historic levels of client retention.  
The post-pandemic future of work is still evolving. We remain focused on helping our clients adapt. Near term, this includes PPP forgiveness, employee retention tax credits, rebuilding workforces and managing the return-to-work environment. While we are very proud of the performance during fiscal 2021, we are even more excited about how well positioned we are for growth in fiscal '22. The combination of our sales momentum, client-based growth and satisfaction, industry-leading operating margin and increased investment in our marketing lead generation and product development has us well positioned for another year of strong financial performance in fiscal 2022.  
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as our guidance in fiscal '22. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that has all of the disclosure on these issues. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please again refer to our press release for more information on these measures.  
Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. I'll then follow up greater detail in certain areas, and I'll discuss our full year fiscal 2021 results.  
For the fourth quarter, it was strong. What can you say? Total revenue increased 12% to $1 billion, and service revenue increased 14% to $1 billion as we benefited from improved employment levels and higher client counts across all of our solutions, growth rates were bolstered by an easier compared to the prior year fourth quarter that was significantly impacted by the pandemic. And remember, last year, we had a fairly strong quarter in terms of interest on funds held for clients. We're battling that headwind and delivered the results that you see.  
Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to $756 million, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 13% to $258 million. Interest on funds held, as I just mentioned, decreased 43% as the lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances.  
Expenses increased 10% to $675 million. The growth was -- the growth in expenses was driven by higher performance-based comp, which compared to a prior quarter that reflected a sharp decline due to the pandemic and higher PEO direct insurance costs.  
Operating income increased 18% to $354 million, with an operating margin of 34.4%, 160 basis point improvement from the prior year fourth quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 24% for the fourth quarter compared to 24.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards, and we do call those out.  
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 18% for the fourth quarter to $261 million and $0.72 per share, respectively.  
Let me touch quickly on full year results. Service revenues, as Marty indicated, increased 1% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 2%, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 2%. Interest on funds declined 32% to $59 million due to lower average interest rates. And realized gains and total revenue was flat year-over-year at $4.1 billion. Operating income was flat year-over-year at $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 2% to $1.5 billion with a margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin excludes onetime costs of $32 million related to the acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy.  
To reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the fourth -- the first quarter, I should say, as you know. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $3.04.  
Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio now has an average yield of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% and 1.2% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, respectively, down from the 1.5% and 1.8% for the same period last year.  
Financial position. I'll walk you through our -- the highlights of our financial position. It obviously remains pretty strong. I'd say very strong since we have over $1.1 billion with total borrowings of $805 million as of May 31, 2021. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, an increase from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. As you know, they vary widely on a day-to-day basis, and they averaged $4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.9 billion for the fiscal year.  
Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $79 million as of May 31, 2021, compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. This decrease in net gain position resulted from increases in longer-term yields during the year.  
Stockholders' equity was $2.9 billion as of May 31, 2021, and reflected $909 million in dividends paid and $156 million of shares repurchased. Our return for equity for the past 12 months was 38%.  
Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for the fiscal year. That actually was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease, though, was driven by fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivable due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We just simply didn't purchase a lot of receivables last year in the same quarter, and it also was influenced by the growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll-related liability.  
Now let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macroeconomic environment, which continues to show gradual recovery. Our outlook will be as follows. Let me just make this comment before we do that. One of the things that we're really proud of is if you go back to what we said in April of last year before we knew everything that we know now, we got some things wrong, but we got a lot of things right, and we also -- we're very, very transparent with the investment community around what we expected to happen. I think if you look at what happened in the year, we were a lot more wrong than -- a lot more right than wrong. 
There were things that we couldn't have pegged, which was the speed of the recovery, the sharpness of it. We got the direction. We got the shape of it correctly. We knew the year hinge on the fourth quarter being better. We looked at the macroeconomic data and thought that what happened in fourth quarter would happen, and it was stronger than we expected. But the point I want to make is simply that we communicated along all of those steps, and we did it in a very transparent fashion. We didn't say we didn't know. We told you what we knew. We told you what we didn't know, and this is where we ended.  
So with that, in the spirit of those comments, here's where we're landing for '22. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be even with this year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 38%, an increase of approximately 120 basis points.  
Let me pause on that. If you look at what happened just happened, I would say we are among the few companies that not only grew margins in the middle of a pandemic but then raise them in the following year, and that's a result of a lot of hard work here, not only in IT, but also in services and -- across the entire organization. A lot of the initiatives that we took are paying dividend going into next year, and we have more than we can do.  
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be, again, approximately 42%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We will have some benefit from stock comp exercises. We don't know what that is, so we don't peg it into the guidance.  
Given the shape of the recovery during fiscal 2021, we expect fiscal 2022 to have stronger growth in the first half of the year and then moderate in the second half. The first half of the year is anticipated to have total revenue growth in the high single digits and an adjusted operating margin in the range of 37% to 38%.  
To give you some more color on expectations for the first quarter. We anticipate strong year-over-year growth as the fiscal 2021 first quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the low double digits. I'd say it's probably in the 11% to 13% range, but certainly low double digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we'll update you again on the first quarter call.  
And then just final comment as we wrap up the prepared remarks. I'd just say this, that when the pandemic started, I fielded a lot of calls from investors and analysts about how we would fare in the pandemic. I think this quarter shows how we fared in the pandemic. We are a very, very resilient business. And even during a downturn that no one expected, we did some things that were pretty extraordinary. We take pride in that. That was the work of every single employee in Paychex from sales to ops, to IT, et cetera. And you know what, as Marty said, we think the best is yet to come.  
So with that, I'll turn it back to Marty."

When staffing declines at that level, then there's simply no -- nothing to fund. There's no receivables to fund. And so if you look at last year, our cash flow was $1.44 billion. That is -- that was much higher than even I expected, but that's because we didn't put out any money to fund staffing. This year, we had a really sharp rebound in the first -- in the back half of the year and in the fourth quarter, and that was a very good performer for us, but that means that we purchase more receivables. We get, obviously, some benefit from doing that. The way it's reflected in the statement of cash flows is that, that shows the growth in receivables.

So I'd say the first thing, Ramsey, is that when we took the charge last year, we knew that it would produce or we believe and modeled that it would produce a certain return, and it produced that return in probably a little bit more. So kudos to the team that did that.  
I think that we continue to evaluate what the right footprint is. There's no additional charges contemplated. But as we examine that footprint, we're looking for ways to become more efficient. That's number one.  
Number two, one of the things that a pandemic produces is it produces a keen focus on every single line of expense in the P&L. And I would say that for a company like ours, that is built on the idea that we have to operate very efficiently. We looked at it and said not every single dollar of cost that was in the model prepandemic needs to be in the model post pandemic. And so we thought we could comfortably manage with a slightly different level of expenses. And so the expense growth did not match the revenue growth.  
So the third thing is a sharp rebound in revenue then produces the ability to leverage further than you would if those costs came in or you didn't have that level of revenue growth. 
I would say this, I get the question many, many times, what's the theoretical max for how our margins can grow? The short answer is that -- we don't have any answer on that. But obviously, there is a theoretical max. But the point is that increasingly, we are -- we look for more and more operating efficiencies as our systems get better and better, and they have gotten better and better. And our operating model has gotten more and more efficient. So it's really a combination of all of those. It's sustainable, and all of those things are influencing that number."

And I think you also mentioned there was a bunch of drivers there, whether it's product, service levels, blocking and tackling, et cetera. But can you also call out a couple of things there that have really made the difference? And then maybe also just tack on there. Has the PPP -- your servicing in terms of the PPP loans made a difference there. Are your clients sort of locked in a little more now because they have to unwind all that process? Or is that big enough to move the needle in your business?"

I think clients learned that there was a great value -- more value than they maybe have thought in having us and the experts -- the expertise that we have with compliance and so forth. The ability to be able to provide them access to those PPP loans, the day they were available and giving them a prepopulated kind of an application that they could file for the loan, a prepopulated application that was signature-ready for the forgiveness, the ability that we linked with 3 fintech providers to help them facilitate loans and when they couldn't get some -- the interest from the banks was really very helpful, and I think that has contributed a lot. 
They're at a stage now where -- and they're still finding that with the employee retention tax credit, we're doing a tremendous service to them by helping them understand that there even is an employee retention tax credit and how big that can be to support them from a cash flow perspective. So I think all of those things, in addition to the strength of the product and the service already has really contributed to people saying, hey, I'm not going to leave to save a 10% or a free month of service when I see the benefits that the Paychex and the team have provided me."

Maybe a little bit -- just slightly off from what we would do in a typical year, but pretty close.  
I think that the way we have pegged our plans is that, again, we expect in the second half of the year a return to more normal unemployment rates. The first half will still continue to be impacted by what we see, which many of you know is difficulty in hiring. SMB is struggling to fill physicians. I would say that this forecast that we have does not assume, even that we're at the same level of checks per payroll or pays per control that we were prepandemic [indiscernible] through next year. If we get to that point, that would be upside to this model, but that's not what we're expecting. We obviously believe it will improve. Although I would say if you looked at the underlying data that forms a plan, it's pretty modest improvement at this point.

Retirement and HR was very strong. Retirement was very weak in the first quarter, as you'd expect, going through the beginning of the pandemic. People weren't talking about retirement. We shifted some of those resources toward HR outsourcing. They did a great job. Then as we saw more interest in retirement, they shifted back. We introduced the Pooled Employer Plan in January, as I mentioned. That took off, and there's been a very strong need for the Pooled Employer Plan that has really helped support retirement.

So there's interesting pockets of demand in the economy above and below 50, and there seems to be a pretty strong demand still for insurance -- health and benefits insurance for -- in the under 50 space, in addition, obviously, PEO.

A lot of the investments we made in self-service and in technology over the last few years really paid off during the pandemic from a standpoint of clients being able to go online and buy and self-serve and set up, and our self-service has picked up dramatically. For existing clients, for example, an employee do it -- changing their own direct deposit, bank account, changing their address, over 80% of those last year were done by the client or the employee now self-service, most of them on mobile -- on our mobile app. So things have changed and they were -- they sped up during the pandemic, and I think they'll continue to do that."

The positive on that, I would say, is that, obviously, we can get more efficient in terms of our dollar spent. But there's an offset to that because you have to spend more on digital marketing. There's no way to avoid it. 
One of the things that we're very, very proud of this year is if you look at us, look at what we did from the beginning of the pandemic, we did our first TV advertising. We increased our marketing spend. We didn't decrease it this year. So -- but that's going to be more of a permanent feature of the way the business operates."

I think the biggest one that is, of course, the HR outsourcing. That's had double-digit growth from the ASO model. I think clients realized in a year, particularly with the pandemic that they had so many questions on how to handle remote workforces. How do you handle vaccine policy? How do you handle -- how you're going to -- flexible work schedules, things that they've never addressed before, we saw great demand for HR at all sizes of clients -- and how to handle federal and state regulation. So I think we opened up a whole number of clients who hadn't thought that they needed it maybe to realize that there's a lot of ongoing support that they could gain from HR services. 
Now we have over 600 HR specialists across the country that provided some great expertise even remotely to these clients and a huge compliance team behind them in legal and marketing that would take the rules and regulations coming out of the Fed and the state governments, boil those down, make them understandable and train our HRGs who then train those clients on how to handle it. And I think that's not going to go backwards. I think for -- especially even for the next year, now the issue is how do I hire someone? How do I retain them? How do I keep them in my company with career pathing and development? And how do I use our products like data analytics that would show you this is what the pay might -- you might want to pay someone. This is how you might want to handle their development and do it all, by the way, remotely through our Flex app and paperless onboarding and so forth. I think that's going to be the biggest demand and growth besides retirement and time and attendance and, of course, insurances. 
And even beyond that, of course, there's merchant services that we sell through partnerships. There's going to be pay-on-demand options that we already offer that will continue to grow, all of those things. There's a tremendous -- once they see the value that we have -- that we can provide them, I think there's tremendous upside in the penetration."

And that, by the way, as people pivoted to selling virtually in the first half of the year. But the third one, which we -- which Marty mentioned, which is important, is we had 18% growth in worksite employees in HR-related services, and we now were at 1.7 million worksite employees served. We dwarf anyone else in the industry. So -- and we think we're still only scratching the surface. So -- and the revenue opportunity is multiples of payroll, as I've mentioned to you -- all of you before. We think we still have a lot of opportunity.

But again, it's a challenge to find people, although it's a little easier to find them there, in those 2 states, frankly, than in other areas of the state. So I think PEO will pick up some. It's just been slower to pick up because the focus has been more on the HR need. Now the HR need being how do I handle things like I mentioned, like vaccination policy, people working from home, new flexible schedules. Now it'll -- it's shifting to not only that, but also how do I hire and retain in a really tough market to find people. And I think one of those things is going to be benefits in insurance."

And there's cash account, bank accounts, whether you're in the market or not, if you're in the market, the market's way up and you're feeling pretty confident of your financial position. If you're not in the market, but you have stimulus payments, you've still got some of the highest cash accounts, I think if you look at the stats across the country that we've had in years. So people are feeling like they've got some financial wherewithal, at least temporarily, to probably get through the next couple of months. 
And then I think, honestly, it's going to open up pretty drastically in the fall would be my take because the unemployment is going to come back down as well as the rules of looking for work. The schools should be back open full, hopefully, and day cares. I think even more will be known, obviously, about COVID and the impacts of vaccinations. Hopefully, vaccinations are up strongly as well. By all those, now you start to get the September, October, I think things are going to open and people are going to be getting back to work as cash accounts start drifting down a little bit."

And what I mean by that, Kevin, is that some of that had to be incorporated in the business in order to drive the efficiency that you see. And part of the way some of those investments were structured were that we would accept higher IT spending in exchange for efficiencies in other parts of the organization. I think that what you've seen is on the operations side, significant efficiencies, and the team has done a great job of leveraging the investments we've made. I'd say [ that's the one ]. 
I think the second part is simply that when -- I mentioned earlier is when you go through one of these experiences, there's some geographic optimization, that helped, but you also look at what extent you actually need and you realize you don't need 100 cents on the dollar, maybe you need $0.99.

If someone -- as candidates apply for that job, you can now see all that through Flex. 
You can do video interviews. You can onboard that employee and all of their information that, frankly, they can sell -- set up by themselves, the person that's applying for the job, and all that can be done and then approved and set up and run a payroll and all their other HR products from us, all paperless without ever anyone touching anything.

We have not seen the losses, as Efrain mentioned, from price value, that's improved, to go to competitors, that has improved, particularly our largest competitor. I think we've done extremely well there from holding on to clients. The sales have also -- I think we're picking up much more from an HR perspective. 
A couple of years ago, we started selling really not from just a payroll perspective, but from an HR perspective because we saw we were leaving value on the table for what the client really needed. And I think that has helped us a tremendous amount, too, for a client to say, hey, I'm not just looking for payroll. I'm looking for an HR need. And when you sell the HR need, it has time and attendance, which then leads to the payroll, and it's a total package. So I think we've seen a nice pickup from the way we sell, the way we market. Our leads are up double digits from last year, from the way we're marketing on social media through the Thrive Conference, the business conference we just had. I mean we have gotten much more sophisticated in the marketing and making the leads that we're getting much more efficient for the sales teams to be able to go out and sell. And then if they're not ready to buy, we have a great nurturing process of that lead that we have started a few years ago that I think has really matured extremely well."

I think we've optimized our model to produce margins that are really pretty impressive even when the clients are small. I think that, for example, a SurePayroll client has a surprisingly high level of lifetime value in part because they're being onboarded onto a platform that's optimized for that size of the client. 
And so when we look at the portfolio, we're looking at everything from very low end clients to higher end clients and trying to get the mix right. We feel comfortable that we've got that right and that next year, maybe you'll skew a little bit less to the small and a little bit bigger. So average client side maybe has a chance to tick up.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website. for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22 guidance. We will then open it up for questions. 
Fiscal '22 is off to a very strong start with Q1 results above our expectations. Total revenue increased 16% with double-digit growth in both management solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions while total expenses declined by 1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41%. While results benefited from the compare to a pandemic-impacted first quarter last year and improvements in the economy, our internal execution has been strong with continued momentum in sales, marketing and client retention. 
During the first quarter, positive macroeconomic trends continued. This was evident in the growth in checks per payroll and net increase in worksite employees within our existing base of HR outsourcing clients, particularly with our ASO offering. Our client retention remains near record levels, reflective of both the resilience of small businesses and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. 
Our sales momentum continued with strong first quarter sales performance as measured by new annualized revenue, reflecting solid performance in digital sales, our mid-market sales and our HR outsourcing divisions. Our unique value proposition of combining the most comprehensive human capital management software platform with our deep HR expertise continues to resonate with prospective clients. 
We continue to invest in our sales force and support them through increased digital marketing and lead generation initiatives. We are well positioned for the upcoming selling season. We continue to leverage our investments in research and development to expand the capabilities of our industry-leading software, Paychex Flex. Our investments in self-service, artificial intelligence and machine learning and analytics, payments, wearables and voice recognition allow us to offer cutting-edge technology, specifically designed to deliver automation and efficiency to both administrators and their employees. 
Our recent Pulse of HR reported -- survey reported identified hiring retention and software automation to gain efficiencies as the top industry trends facing businesses of all sizes. Our fall release introduces a series of software enhancements to further strengthen the power of Paychex Flex. 
We currently offer 2 options for clients in their search for talent, a fully integrated connection, API connection with indeed the world's largest job board for clients who are looking for a pool of applicants; and a comprehensive recruiting and applicant tracking offering called Flex Hiring for businesses looking for integrated technology to manage the entire recruiting process. We made enhancements to both to provide clients with tools they need to post jobs, attract candidates and allow new hires to digitally self-onboard via our Flex mobile application. 
With employee retention being a significant issue in this challenging environment, we've introduced several enhancements to provide our clients with insights and offerings designed to help them in making informed decisions and retain their workforce. The introduction of retention insights, our first client-facing predictive analytics was designed to identify employees who may be at risk of leaving, for example. Second is pay benchmarking, which allows employers to compare performance ratings and compensation details by position to ensure top performers are paid equitably. With our advanced technology, employers can easily compare individual employee compensation against national averages provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to confirm the impact of compensation on retention. 
We're excited also to announce a new offering called Paychex Pre-Check to fully -- to further automate the payroll process for employers and provide their employees an opportunity to review their gross to net calculation before payroll is officially processed. With Paychex Pre-Check, employees are notified through their channel of choice, their phone, their tablet, their smart watch or their smart speakers, that they have a pending pay period to review. The employee leverages Paychex Flex to either confirm the amount of their check or report an issue. Issues are routed electronically to allow clients to focus on exceptions and proactively address issues prior to pay day. 
Paychex Pre-Check leverages our industry-leading flex payroll and time and attendance offerings, HR Connect offering, our digital employee case management tool, our advanced analytics module, our 5-star rated mobile app and expands our conversational UI capabilities, including our integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri Shortcuts. With these additions, Paychex Flex is the first HCM application to offer integration with 3 of the major voice assistant platforms. 
Paychex Pre-Check was recently recognized by HR Executive Magazine in the HR Tech Conference and Exposition with the Top HR Product of the Year Award, an award that spotlights innovation driving the HR technology market. This is a 3-peat for us, marks the third consecutive year that Paychex has been recognized as a top HR product innovator by HR Tech. 
In addition to our innovative technology, the expertise and advice we're able to provide clients on HR matters really sets us apart. Our HR professionals have been very important in helping ASO and PEO clients to navigate through the pandemic and in handling the current uncertainty around COVID with the recent uptick in transmission rates, return-to-office plans and potential vaccine mandates. 
We are very proud of the work our HR professionals do, and we're honored to be recognized by winning a gold Human Capital Management Excellence Award from the Brandon Hall Group in the category of best use of a blended learning program for our HR Services Excellence Academy training program. This training program prepares our new HR professionals to provide exemplary consulting services to the company's HR outsourcing clients and was recognized for combining instructor-led training with technology-based activities. The expertise we offer our clients also expands to providing resources to assist clients with their many compliance obligations. 
Our COVID response continues near real-time updates to our COVID-19 help center, where businesses can access key information regarding changing regulations, including the recent Biden administration proposal and vaccine mandates. We assisted our clients in receiving over $65 billion in Paycheck Protection loans. That's 9% of the total PPP loans provided. And our industry-leading PPP forgiveness tools and reports have been accessed over 500,000 times since its release with over 90% of businesses now reporting their initial loan has been forgiven. We have also been instrumental in helping clients secure over $4 billion in stimulus funds available through the employee retention and paid lead credits. 
We recently launched an enhanced offering, the Paychex employee retention tax credit service to help businesses retroactively identify tax credit eligibility based on wages already paid and file amended returns to claim the credit. On average, Paychex clients are claiming over $150,000 in tax credits, a substantial amount for a small or midsized business, that is helping them survive and thrive in this pandemic. 
The pandemic has only exacerbated the retirement crisis in America in response to a growing number of states that have introduced state-mandated retirement programs, and our pooled employer plan, or PEP, offering as well as traditional plants have helped our clients handle new state mandates in ways that make financial sense for the employer and employees. 
For the 11th consecutive year, Paychex has earned the distinction as the largest 401(k) record keeper by a total number of 401(k) plans, serving more than 96,000 plans. We have seen continued success in helping clients find retirement plans that suit their employees' needs and help them to attract and retain clients. 
We are very proud of our performance during the first quarter but remain vigilant about the rest of the fiscal year given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 variance. Our very strong start in sales, continued client base growth, best-in-class operating margin and increased investment in marketing, lead generation and product development have us well positioned for continued financial and operating success during the remainder of fiscal year '22 and beyond. 
I'd like to close my comments by recognizing again the company's 50th anniversary. From our founders' start with $3,000 and a few clients, we have transformed into a comprehensive, technology-driven human capital management software company with over 710,000 clients across the U.S. and Europe. In addition to paying 1 in every 12 American private sector employees, we are the country's largest 401(k) record keeper, a top 30 U.S. insurance agency and among the largest providers of HR outsourcing in the U.S. supporting over 1.7 million worksite employees. 
While the size and the breadth of the company has changed, we remain true to our original mission of serving the unique needs of small and midsized businesses. That mission was all the more important during the challenges faced over the past 18 months. 
I'd like to thank and commend our employees for their tireless dedication to innovation and commitment to serving our clients. They have driven our growth over these 50 years. And our shareholders, we thank them for their investment with us along the way. 
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter.

I'd like to remind you to sort that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures.

I'd like to remind you to sort that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures. I'll move through my comments relatively quickly so we can get to your questions. 
I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release, investor presentation for more information on these measures, especially on the investor presentation, too, if you want to have a clear road map in terms of what's included and what's not on the adjustments we make. 
I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow with greater detail in some areas. I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook, which as you saw was revised upwards. 
First quarter reflected strong internal execution, improved economic environment and favorable compares against the prior period. Service revenue -- total revenue increased 16% to $1.1 billion as we benefited from improved employment levels, higher client counts across all of our solutions. Growth rates were bolstered by a more easy compare to the prior year first quarter that was impacted by the pandemic. But as Marty said, we also had very strong execution in the quarter. 
Within service revenue, Management Solutions increased 17% to $805 million. And PEO and insurance revenue increased 14% to $263 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the quarter as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. We'll see what happens in the balance of the year as interest rates have started to move higher. 
Total expenses decreased 1% to $640 million, excluding onetime costs of $31 million that occurred during the first quarter fiscal 2021 expenses increased to modest 4%. The growth in expenses was impacted by higher PEO direct insurance costs, increases in fringe benefits and continued investment in product development and information technology. 
One thing I'd like to point out here that's important is if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, our performance was strong even when we measure against that quarter. So not only did we have strong compares against a COVID-impacted quarter, but go back to 2020, and you'll see this was a strong quarter overall. And I think it says fundamentally something important about how the company has transformed over the last 2 years. 
Op income for this quarter increased 56% to $443 million with an operating margin of 41%. Adjusted operating margin was also 41% during the first quarter compared with 33.8% for the prior year, an expansion of more than 700 basis points. 
Effective income tax was 24.9 compared to 23.4. The first quarter was impacted by an increase in state tax provisions. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock based compensation benefits. As you know, we exclude those for purposes of our adjusted calculation. 
Adjusted net income increased 42%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 42 -- sorry adjusted net income increased 42, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41% for the quarter to $323 million and $0.89 per share, respectively. 
Investments in income, our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.8%, an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.3% in the prior year. 
Now let's look at our financial position. It's in a nutshell, pretty strong. It remains strong with restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.2 billion. Our borrowings were $805 million as of August 31. 
Cash flow from operations was $386 million during the first quarter, a robust increase of 79% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $354 million, up 83% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share for a total of $238 million during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 42%. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. This outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter, especially in June and July. 
First quarter results exceeded expectations. Nevertheless, as all of you know, there's uncertainty about the trajectory of the remainder of the next several quarters. So we've incorporated this into our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our crystal ball is clear and near we are and a little bit less clear as we go out, and now we're into the spring of next year. 
So with all that said, management solutions, we expect it to grow now approximately 8%. That's guided upward from 7% -- approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. That's similar to what we said. Previously, interest on funds held for clients, still expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%, again, guided upwards from 7%. 
Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39%, up from previous guidance of approximately 38%. And if there's a point I would make simply it's this, that we went through a pandemic, we made a lot of adjustments in the operating margin, and our returns are really, really strong. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin now is expected to be approximately 43%, up from previous guidance of approximately 42%. Other income and expense net is expected to be in the range of $23 million to $26 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The change is due to certain nonoperating income received during the first quarter. And then specifically before I get the question on that, let me just say that we have invested in a technology fund. We received a mark that ended up in us recognizing income on that technology fund, which invests in early-stage technology companies. 
Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 10% to 12%. 
Turning to the second quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 8%. And adjusted -- remember, it's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37%. 
Before I get the call, I will just say on everything, there's an element of conservatism in what we say, in part because the macro environment does impact -- we don't obviously have a crystal ball on when it happened in the second quarter and beyond, and we're trying to create an all-weather forecast. 
Now of course, all of what I just said is subject to current assumptions, which can change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the second quarter call. I'll refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. 
And now with all of that, I'll turn it over to Marty."

I think there's 2 pieces to the way we look at the year, what we see in the first half and what we see in the back half. 
So I would say with respect to the EPS, we've factored into our assumptions additional hiring as the year progresses, which will add a bit to expenses. So I think that's the first part of the equation. 
The second part is that we do not, at this point in our guidance, contemplate that the unemployment picture is going to change significantly. So to the extent that it does, that it is significantly -- or it's improved from where we are, that would be upside to our case. 
We simply are at a point where we had in the first quarter a nice rebound in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That obviously helps from a revenue standpoint, What happens going forward, we simply have to try to estimate what we think is a reasonable, as I said, all-weather scenario.  Those are really kind of the 2 things that are driving it. 
And I would say this on the back half of the year because I'll get questions on that. The back half of the year, we'll see where we come out of Q2 and then get a better feel for it. I understand we were very strong in the first quarter. There is conservatism in what we what we've guided to, and we could do better. But as everyone on the call knows, there is uncertainty about a number of things in the macro environment that we want to make sure that investors have completely taken into account and to assure investors that we've taken it completely into account. So all of that mouthful was in the forecast."

So Ramsey, let me -- I made a comment which during my prepared comments about the compare to 2020, and I think that's important. You can go back. These are matters of public disclosure. 
If you look at what happened with expenses, our expenses are pretty flat against 2020. There's 2 things, one of which is likely nonrecurring, but one of which is very recurring and is part of our strategy. So I keep harping on the idea that we've been on this journey and transformation as a technology-enabled services provider. And look, I can say whatever I want to, and Marty can say whatever he wants to, but if it's not evident in the P&L, that speaks for itself. 
If you look at our expenses, they're essentially flat with 2020, quarter 1. Now why is that? Obviously, they should be somewhat up. So there's an element of this that really has to do with delayed or deferred hiring. The labor market is tight. It's not necessarily easy to get all of the people that you want in place. We are adequately hired, but we're a little bit behind where we would have expected to be hired at this point. 
Part of the question that David asked earlier is why wouldn't you see even more flow-through. The short answer is that we expect to hire as we go through the year, perhaps not at the rate that we would have previously, but certainly at a rate that is higher than the first quarter. But leave that to a side, the reality is that when we took a restructuring charge in the first quarter, it yielded benefits -- I'm sorry, the first quarter of last year, it yielded benefits this quarter. When we looked at our headcount and looked at those metrics of efficiency, we are more efficient as a company today than we were in 2020. And that is what's driving a lot of what you're seeing. More investment in technology, less investment on -- in other areas of the business that are not needed, frankly, at this point, is driving the efficiency that you're seeing and the results that we've delivered."

What we have seen though is that the work we were able to do for clients during COVID, the support we were able to provide them, excuse me, and the products that we are going to provide them to help them get loans now, to help them in a really a great automated fashion, get an employee retention tax credit, for example, this makes a huge difference from a competitive standpoint of retention and even from a prospect perspective as to whether they're aware -- and from a prospect perspective, it's, ""Hey, were you even aware that you could get this retention tax credit, and do you know how much this can bring you to help you with hiring new employees or retaining your current employees?""

We really -- again, I'll mention mid-market was strong. Digital -- any digital sales were strong. And we also have seen very good results on HR outsourcing, both PEO and ASO. So it's not like it started strong, and the beginning of the summer went down. It actually has been pretty consistent. And we actually think there's some opportunity from a sales perspective this month and over the next few months across the board, including retirement, and retirement has been very strong as well."

So the first thing I'd say is to sort of step -- take a step back because Management Solutions is not entirely a payroll game. It's really kind of, in important respects, got 3 pieces, so the HCM part, retirement services and HR outsourcing. So those are the 3 big buckets, if you will, in Management Solutions. 
I would say I couldn't see anything on the PEO that was a major revenue line that wasn't up double digits. So on the HCM side, we benefited from upper single-digit pays per control. So that was helpful. Now that's not surprising. We had a pretty big decline in the first quarter. But in addition to that, there was pricing and also client base growth. So all of those were driving that result. 
On the HR outsourcing side, we simply had a great year last year, had more worksite employees served, and that drove that result. 
And then on retirement services, Marty talked about that. Retirement services is gaining steam across the country, and we are certainly benefiting from it with mandates in multiple states now. Our pet product, we feel -- we are and I don't feel it, we believe it and see it that we're well positioned. So when you look at all of those 3, it took all of those 3 to drive that result. It wasn't solely an HCM story. And I think it plays to the fact that we sell in an integrated way, and we've benefited from that in terms of the point that Marty made earlier, which is we're getting better revenue per client."

I mean, clearly, just -- I'm just going to ask one question, but just maybe weave in the client growth, right? I mean, you picked up 75,000 clients. That's 11% growth. I don't think you've ever done that. So I mean, it seems like the business is poised for structurally higher growth. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here, but can you help us understand where that sits, particularly given the leverage on the margin side as well?"

We disclosed that we were up [ above 7 10,  ] and we had been in the high 600s a year before. But to your point, directionally, our client growth has been strong over the past several years, in part impacted by this move to digital that Marty talked about. So that's one part. 
The second part is that the move to digital brings with it the ability to operate at higher levels of efficiency, which is what you're seeing in the P&L. So that's a big emphasis within the company. And I would say shout out to all of my colleagues in operations have done a phenomenal job and to the IT and product group who will also make that happen. Can't happen any other way. So I'd say that's the second point. 
And then the third point, Kevin, to your point, last year, we ended it, as I mentioned to folks on the call, we were in the high 80s in terms of revenue retention. There is a natural ceiling on the amount of revenue growth -- I'm sorry, revenue retention we can have because of some of the markets that we operate in, meaning that the smaller clients tend to attrit more rapidly than larger clients, but all of that moved up. 
Previous to the pandemic, final point, we were in the 83% to 84% range. I would say that's the new Mendoza line for retention. And last year, we beat that. We hope to beat that and build off of that, and all of my colleagues in operations share that goal."

They can answer that. They hear about that on their mobile phone. They can hear about it from their smart speaker. So meaning that -- and we're tied in now -- we're the only company tied into all 3 of the major voice-assisted platforms. So it's saying, ""Your paystub is ready if you'd like to check it,"" and you can respond that you have checked. I think of the efficiency that it brings the employer and the administrator of the employer of the client and the employee as well now is this is really helping continue our retention at the levels that Efrain is talking about. 
Even though there's business failures in small business that keeps us at some point, at some level, this is really taking it to the highest level. And that on top of the COVID work that we did and the ability to update them and really provide support and dollars through the like employee retention tax credit. is making a big difference. 
And it's really a very different company. It is a software-driven company that is using artificial intelligence and data analytics to give a tremendous amount of efficiency to our clients."

Obviously, we still have great relationships with CPAs and as well as banks in getting referrals.

I would say the PEO side has picked back up more recently. I think we talked about it last year, maybe the last couple of quarters that insurance wasn't as in demand at that time because of getting through the pandemic. That is starting to come back now more because of a sense of retention of your employees and hiring your employees. It's -- as you know, it's a very competitive market out there. And so now the insurance plans, your health insurance et cetera, your dental, your voluntary insurances, they're becoming very much a competitive offering to attract employees in a tough market and retain those that you have.

So I think what you're finding is it's going to take a little bit longer in the market. It's definitely still a tough hiring market.

We also -- and it's probably the hardest on the frontline service providers. John Gibson, who runs all of services, had done a great job with our HR team to find very creative ways, though the hiring has really picked back up. We've shifted to some different ways to encourage new employees to come in, different work schedules, different abilities, certainly work from home and a number of other benefits that they can get in the tools and support that they have. 
So it's picking back up now, particularly just in the last 30 days, but as Efrain said, it's a tough market out there to hire particularly frontline service people. But as we said, we still are seeing very strong client retention. We're getting the job done, and we're certainly driving more calls to the website, which our chatbot, our automated response to service questions and other questions are being answered 60% of the time by the automated response. 
You can always reach someone live at Paychex 24 hours by 7 days a week, 365 days a year. And -- but we are certainly looking for efficiencies, and we're hiring very creatively, and it's starting to pick back up again."

The first I'd say is when you look at our gross margins and compare -- ignore for a second our operating margins. But if you look at our gross margins and compare against industry, we still are right at the top. And that's against the people who are ""pure software players."" So look at the data, that's what I would say. We're proud of that. We understand that. We manage that. 
To your point, when I look at the data, and I mentioned, I think in response to an earlier question, it might have been Ramsey's question about the strength in management solutions, what was really notable about that was that it was widespread across the 3 major buckets of Management Solutions: retirement, HR and HCM. And what we're seeing is that our sales team has done a really good job of selling the entire, we call, value proposition of the company through what we call the power of 3,000. And the idea is that when we get in front of a client, we want to sell them the entirety of that value proposition. 
Now just one small digression on that point. You can only do that if you've got an integrated system, not just HCM, but integrated ancillaries. So when you sell that proposition and now you've upgraded to a module, there's essentially very, very low variable costs associated with that. And that's really what's helping to drive what we see. We are -- we have been selling a bit higher in terms of client size, but more importantly, we have been selling more modules especially on high-value ancillaries like HR. So you're right. All of that is driving the improved margin performance that you're seeing."

You won't see that -- we don't think you'll see that in future quarters. So that's going to present a little bit of a compare issue. 
We did have better pricing in the quarter than we had versus the pandemic-impacted quarter last year. So what happened is we did take steps in that first quarter of last year to hold off on price increases until we had a chance to let our customers take a breather that was unique to the quarter. And as we anniversaried it, that helped. 
And then the third thing is that clients were -- our client count was up significantly versus where we started the year last year. All of those things made Q1. The confluence of those things were really important. 
And then finally, HR really took off in the first quarter of last year. We saw the strength through the remainder of the year. But when you got the first quarter, now you saw the full annualized impact of that strength in HR. Hey, Bryan, there's an element of conservatism in our numbers. We'll see where we end up, but it won't -- we're not going to have the same revenue growth in the second quarter. And that's why, in addition to everything else, we know that Q1 had certain factors in it that don't repeat in other quarters.

Then we have 90% of our clients have been able to have their loans forgiven. A lot of that is we made it easy for them. We hear this time and time again that they were at a very dire point of going out of business, yet we helped them get the loans. We've partnered with 3 fintech companies to provide them another source for loans. We helped them with the forgiveness.

So we're very excited about that one. 
Also that it is tied to the technology. It's tied to smart speakers. We're the only company tied to all 3 major voice assistant platforms. This is just a whole new way for clients to be able to handle things with their employees to say, ""Hey, your paycheck is ready. Would you like to check it, your paystub?"" Or from an employer standpoint, that you get Alexa that's telling you, ""Hey, you have 3 things to do today,"" as an employer"" I mean these kind of things are really tying much better retention than anything. 
And the retention insights, for example, really just uses the artificial intelligence to a great deal. You can check not only pay, but you can look at -- we look at like 15, 20 different indicators that are in the payroll, in the system, in the software that will say, ""Here's your performance rating of this person. Here's -- their pay is below the national average based on PAS. Their pay is below the rest of the team that have this job category of your own company. Hey, watch out on the dashboard, this person may be likely to leave you."" 
When clients start seeing that, it's not as much about the revenue directly from that software, it's from the retention of saying, ""I can't live without this,"" just like the mobile app has been like that for us. They have a five-star mobile app that employees don't want to leave because it's easy to use and they can do so many things themselves, it's great from a retention standpoint. 
So we're really excited about the level of speed that we're putting out software enhancements and the strength of being much more of a technology company and software company and that that's leading to retention."

The major competitor and some of the other that you know so well, I think we're doing very well against them, with the technology enhancements, the software enhancements that we've just mentioned, and the ability to be able to show all of that. 
I think sometimes people still think of us as a more of a service company, great service company, but not the technology. When we're able to show the technology enhancements that we've introduced in the last few years, we come up against other competitors, and we perform extremely well. 
And as Efrain mentioned, you know we're fully integrated, so we can provide everything on one solution, Flex, right from retirement to insurance, to and payroll. So it's not necessarily where you might go to a competitor that says, ""Hey, I'm going to pass you to somebody else to do the retirement or pass you to somebody else to do this. Not to mention over 650 HR specialists who are really have been there in the last couple of years, nobody else has a team like that in my opinion. So..."

I mean I think many of the things that we've talked about have really helped clients. You can go right from a financial perspective, which is the employee retention tax credits, giving them dollars in their pocket to pay more for existing employees or to attract employees. So we go right at them to help them with their own financial situation. Then when you look at from the product standpoint -- from the product standpoint, you have all of these things, benefit plans, retirement plans, HR guidance and support. 
Many companies, 25, 30 employees still don't really have the great HR support knowledge that they need to be able to -- how do I attract. And one that I haven't even mentioned today, which is really important is we've had this partnership with Indeed. 
We have a very fully integrated partnership with Indeed, which is the largest -- the world's largest job posting system. And we actually -- a client can go out and post on Indeed, they actually get a credit because they're with Paychex with Indeed for the first couple of postings. They can go out on that job board, post that. If someone applies for that job, they give their demographic information, obviously, in the application. If that's accepted, that comes over with no need to then put that into our system again. It transfers over through API. So we also think we've helped them by getting them in front of the biggest job posting system and making it easy for them to post the job through Flex, place it on Indeed, somebody applies, it comes back from Indeed, self-populates really if their person is hired into the payroll system and the HR system and everything is set. So we've made it easy as much as we can for clients to hire and then retain by giving them the benefits and so forth to keep that employee. 
So we're very proud of the Indeed partnership and what that does, not only gives them a little financial incentive and some discounts on their postings, but it really makes it easy for them to post -- and these are companies even 5 employees to 50 that still struggle sometimes with where to post for a job. 
Ashley, if there's no more -- Efrain does have a statement that he wants to make before we close out."

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days.
This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22 guidance. We will then open it up for questions.
Fiscal '22 is off to a very strong start with Q1 results above our expectations. Total revenue increased 16% with double-digit growth in both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions, while total expenses declined by 1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41%.
While results benefited from the compare to a pandemic-impacted first quarter last year and improvements in the economy, our internal execution has been strong with continued momentum in sales, marketing and client retention.
During the first quarter, positive macroeconomic trends continued. This was evident in the growth in checks per payroll and net increase in worksite employees within our existing base of HR Outsourcing clients, particularly with our ASO offering. Our client retention remains near record levels, reflective of both the resilience of small businesses and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise.
Our sales momentum continued with strong first quarter sales performance as measured by new annualized revenue, reflecting solid performance in digital sales, our mid-market sales and our HR Outsourcing divisions. Our unique value proposition of combining the most comprehensive human capital management software platform with our deep HR expertise continues to resonate with prospective clients.
We continue to invest in our sales force and support them through increased digital marketing and lead generation initiatives. We are well positioned for the upcoming selling season. We continue to leverage our investments in research and development to expand the capabilities of our industry-leading software, Paychex Flex.
Our investments in self-service, artificial intelligence and machine learning and analytics, payments, wearables and voice recognition allow us to offer cutting-edge technology specifically designed to deliver automation and efficiency to both administrators and their employees.
Our recent Pulse of HR reported -- survey reported -- identified hiring retention and software automation to gain efficiencies as the top industry trends facing businesses of all sizes. Our fall release introduces a series of software enhancements to further strengthen the power of Paychex Flex.
We currently offer 2 options for clients in their search for talent: a fully integrated connection, API connection with indeed the world's largest job board for clients who are looking for a pool of applicants; and a comprehensive recruiting and applicant tracking offering called Flex Hiring for businesses looking for integrated technology to manage the entire recruiting process. We made enhancements to both to provide clients with tools they need to post jobs, attract candidates and allow new hires to digitally self-onboard via our Flex mobile application.
With employee retention being a significant issue in this challenging environment, we've introduced several enhancements to provide our clients with insights and offerings designed to help them in making informed decisions and retain their workforce. The introduction of Retention Insights, our first client-facing predictive analytic, was designed to identify employees who may be at risk of leaving, for example.
Second is Pay Benchmarking, which allows employers to compare performance ratings and compensation details by position to ensure top performers are paid equitably. With our advanced technology, employers can easily compare individual employee compensation against national averages provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to confirm the impact of compensation on retention.
We're excited also to announce a new offering called Paychex Pre-Check to fully -- to further automate the payroll process for employers and provide their employees an opportunity to review their gross to net calculation before payroll is officially processed.
With Paychex Pre-Check, employees are notified through their channel of choice: their phone, their tablet, their smart watch or their smart speakers, that they have a pending pay period to review. The employee leverages Paychex Flex to either confirm the amount of their check or report an issue. Issues are routed electronically to allow clients to focus on exceptions and proactively address issues prior to payday.
Paychex Pre-Check leverages our industry-leading Flex payroll and time and attendance offerings; HR Connect offering; our digital employee case management tool; our advanced analytics module; our 5-star rated mobile app; and expands our conversational UI capabilities, including our integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri Shortcuts. With these additions, Paychex Flex is the first HCM application to offer integration with 3 of the major voice assistant platforms.
Paychex Pre-Check was recently recognized by HR Executive Magazine in the HR Tech Conference & Exposition with the Top HR Product of the Year Award, an award that spotlights innovation driving the HR technology market. This is a 3-peat for us, marks the third consecutive year that Paychex has been recognized as a top HR product innovator by HR Tech.
In addition to our innovative technology, the expertise and advice we're able to provide clients on HR matters really sets us apart, and our HR professionals have been very important in helping ASO and PEO clients to navigate through the pandemic and in handling the current uncertainty around COVID with the recent uptick in transmission rates, return-to-office plans and potential vaccine mandates.
We are very proud of the work our HR professionals do, and we're honored to be recognized by winning a gold Human Capital Management Excellence Award from the Brandon Hall Group in the category of Best Use of a Blended Learning Program for our HR Services Excellence Academy training program. This training program prepares our new HR professionals to provide exemplary consulting services to the company's HR outsourcing clients and was recognized for combining instructor-led training with technology-based activities. 
The expertise we offer our clients also expands to providing resources to assist clients with their many compliance obligations. Our COVID response continues near real-time updates to our COVID-19 help center, where businesses can access key information regarding changing regulations, including the recent Biden administration proposal and vaccine mandates.
We assisted our clients in receiving over $65 billion in Paycheck Protection loans. That's 9% of the total PPP loans provided. And our industry-leading PPP forgiveness tools and reports have been accessed over 500,000 times since its release with over 90% of businesses now reporting their initial loan has been forgiven. We have also been instrumental in helping clients secure over $4 billion in stimulus funds available through the employee retention and paid leave credits.
We recently launched an enhanced offering, the Paychex Employee Retention Tax Credit service to help businesses retroactively identify tax credit eligibility based on wages already paid and file amended returns to claim the credit. On average, Paychex clients are claiming over $150,000 in tax credits, a substantial amount for a small or mid-sized business, that is helping them survive and thrive in this pandemic.
The pandemic has only exacerbated the retirement crisis in America. In response to a growing number of states that have introduced state-mandated retirement programs, and our Pooled Employer Plan, or PEP, offering as well as traditional plans have helped our clients handle new state mandates in ways that make financial sense for the employer and employees. 
For the 11th consecutive year, Paychex has earned the distinction as the largest 401(k) recordkeeper by a total number of 401(k) plans, serving more than 96,000 plans. We have seen continued success in helping clients find retirement plans that suit their employees' needs and help them to attract and retain clients.
We are very proud of our performance during the first quarter but remain vigilant about the rest of the fiscal year given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 variance. Our very strong start in sales, continued client base growth, best-in-class operating margin and increased investment in marketing, lead generation and product development have us well positioned for continued financial and operating success during the remainder of fiscal year '22 and beyond.
I'd like to close my comments by recognizing again the company's 50th anniversary. From our founders' start with $3,000 and a few clients, we have transformed into a comprehensive, technology-driven human capital management software company with over 710,000 clients across the U.S. and Europe. In addition to paying 1 in every 12 American private sector employees, we are the country's largest 401(k) recordkeeper, a top 30 U.S. insurance agency and among the largest providers of HR outsourcing in the U.S., supporting over 1.7 million worksite employees.
While the size and the breadth of the company has changed, we remain true to our original mission of serving the unique needs of small and mid-sized businesses. That mission was all the more important during the challenges faced over the past 18 months.
I'd like to thank and commend our employees for their tireless dedication to innovation and commitment to serving our clients. They have driven our growth over these 50 years. And our shareholders, we thank them for their investment with us along the way.
I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter.
Efrain?"

I'd like to remind you, to start, that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. I'll move through my comments relatively quickly so we can get to your questions.
I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release, investor presentation for more information on these measures, especially on the investor presentation, too, if you want to have a clear road map in terms of what's included and what's not on the adjustments we make.
I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow with greater detail in some areas. I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook, which as you saw, was revised upwards. First quarter reflected strong internal execution, improved economic environment and favorable compares against the prior period.
Both service revenue and total revenue increased 16% to $1.1 billion as we benefited from improved employment levels, higher client counts across all of our solutions. Growth rates were bolstered by a more easy compare to the prior year first quarter that was impacted by the pandemic. But as Marty said, we also had very strong execution in the quarter.
Within service revenue, Management Solutions increased 17% to $805 million, and PEO and insurance revenue increased 14% to $263 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the quarter as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. We'll see what happens in the balance of the year as interest rates have started to move higher.
Total expenses decreased 1% to $640 million. Excluding onetime costs of $31 million that occurred during the first quarter, fiscal 2021 expenses increased to modest 4%. The growth in expenses was impacted by higher PEO direct insurance costs, increases in fringe benefits and continued investment in product development and information technology.
One thing I'd like to point out here that's important is if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, our performance was strong even when we measure against that quarter. So not only did we have strong compares against a COVID-impacted quarter, but go back to 2020, and you'll see this was a strong quarter overall. And I think it says fundamentally something important about how the company has transformed over the last 2 years.
Op income for this quarter increased 56% to $443 million with an operating margin of 41%. Adjusted operating margin was also 41% during the first quarter compared with 33.8% for the prior year, an expansion of more than 700 basis points. Effective income tax was 24.9% compared to 23.4%. The first quarter was impacted by an increase in state tax provisions. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation benefits. As you know, we exclude those for purposes of our adjusted calculation.
Adjusted net income increased 42%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased -- I'm sorry. Adjusted net income increased 42%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41% for the quarter to $323 million and $0.89 per share, respectively.
Investments in income, our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.8%, an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.3% in the prior year.
Now let's look at our financial position. It's, in a nutshell, pretty strong. It remains strong with restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.2 billion. Our borrowings were $805 million as of August 31. Cash flow from operations was $386 million during the first quarter, a robust increase of 79% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $354 million, up 83% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share for a total of $238 million during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 42%.
Now let me turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. This outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter, especially in June and July. First quarter results exceeded expectations. Nevertheless, as all of you know, there's uncertainty about the trajectory of the remainder of the next several quarters. So we've incorporated this into our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our crystal ball is clearer the nearer we are and a little bit less clear as we go out, and now we're into the spring of next year.
So with all that said, Management Solutions, we expect it to grow now approximately 8%. That's guided upward from 7% -- approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. That's similar to what we said previously. Interest on funds held for clients, still expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%, again, guided upwards from 7%.
Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39%, up from previous guidance of approximately 38%. And if there's a point I would make simply, it's this. That we went through a pandemic, we made a lot of adjustments in the operating margin, and our returns are really, really strong.
Adjusted EBITDA margin now is expected to be approximately 43%, up from previous guidance of approximately 42%. Other income and expense, net, is expected to be in the range of $23 million to $26 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The change is due to certain nonoperating income received during the first quarter.
And then specifically before I get the question on that, let me just say that we have invested in a technology fund. We received a mark that ended up in us recognizing income on that technology fund, which invests in early-stage technology companies. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 10% to 12%.
Turning to the second quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 8%. And adjusted -- remember, it's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37%. Before I get the call, I will just say, on everything, there's an element of conservatism in what we say, in part because the macro environment does impact -- we don't obviously have a crystal ball on when it happened in the second quarter and beyond, and we're trying to create an all-weather forecast.
Now of course, all of what I just said is subject to current assumptions, which can change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the second quarter call. I'll refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information.
And now with all of that, I'll turn it over to Marty."

I think there's 2 pieces to the way we look at the year, what we see in the first half and what we see in the back half. So I would say with respect to the EPS, we've factored into our assumptions additional hiring as the year progresses, which will add a bit to expenses. So I think that's the first part of the equation.
The second part is that we do not, at this point in our guidance, contemplate that the unemployment picture is going to change significantly. So to the extent that it does, that it is significantly -- or it's improved from where we are, that would be upside to our case.
We simply are at a point where we had in the first quarter a nice rebound in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That obviously helps from a revenue standpoint, What happens going forward, we simply have to try to estimate what we think is a reasonable, as I said, all-weather scenario. Those are really kind of the 2 things that are driving it.
And I would say this. On the back half of the year, because I'll get questions on that, the back half of the year, we'll see where we come out of Q2 and then get a better feel for it. I understand we were very strong in the first quarter. There is conservatism in what we what we've guided to, and we could do better.
But as everyone on the call knows, there is uncertainty about a number of things in the macro environment that we want to make sure that investors have completely taken into account and to assure investors that we've taken it completely into account. So all of that mouthful was in the forecast."

So I think it was really more performance. We're really pleased with the pickup in mid-market, and we think we're really well prepared for selling season as well."

So Ramsey, let me -- I made a comment, which -- during my prepared comments about the compare to 2020, and I think that's important. You can go back. These are matters of public disclosure.
If you look at what happened with expenses, our expenses are pretty flat against 2020. There's 2 things, one of which is likely nonrecurring, but one of which is very recurring and is part of our strategy. So I keep harping on the idea that we've been on this journey and transformation as a technology-enabled services provider. And look, I can say whatever I want to, and Marty can say whatever he wants to, but if it's not evident in the P&L, that speaks for itself.
If you look at our expenses, they're essentially flat with 2020, quarter 1. Now why is that? Obviously, they should be somewhat up. So there's an element of this that really has to do with delayed or deferred hiring. The labor market is tight. It's not necessarily easy to get all of the people that you want in place. We are adequately hired, but we're a little bit behind where we would have expected to be hired at this point.
Part of the question that David asked earlier is why wouldn't you see even more flow-through. The short answer is that we expect to hire as we go through the year, perhaps not at the rate that we would have previously, but certainly at a rate that is higher than the first quarter. But leave that to a side, the reality is that when we took a restructuring charge in the first quarter, it yielded benefits -- I'm sorry, the first quarter of last year, it yielded benefits this quarter.
When we looked at our headcount and looked at those metrics of efficiency, we are more efficient as a company today than we were in 2020. And that is what's driving a lot of what you're seeing. More investment in technology, less investment on -- in other areas of the business that are not needed, frankly, at this point, is driving the efficiency that you're seeing and the results that we've delivered."

So we've really seen that -- I think from a competitive standpoint, when you just get right to that point, I don't think we've seen a lot of changes.
What we have seen though is that the work we were able to do for clients during COVID, the support we were able to provide them, excuse me, and the products that we are going to provide them to help them get loans now, to help them, in a really a great automated fashion, get an employee retention tax credit, for example, this makes a huge difference from a competitive standpoint of retention and even from a prospect perspective as to whether they're aware.
And from a prospect perspective, it's, ""Hey, were you even aware that you could get this retention tax credit, and do you know how much this can bring you to help you with hiring new employees or retaining your current employees?"" For our current clients, the level of support we were able to show them and demonstrate to them during a very difficult time really has made the difference.
So I think it's -- I think the competitive environment is just as strong, but I think we've been able to have an opportunity and then have shown what we can do, and that's given us an even stronger position than we would have had beforehand."

So the first thing I'd say is to sort of step -- take a step back because Management Solutions is not entirely a payroll game. It's really kind of, in important respects, got 3 pieces. So the HCM part, retirement services and HR Outsourcing. So those are the 3 big buckets, if you will, in Management Solutions.
I would say I couldn't see anything on the PEO that was a major revenue line that wasn't up double digits. So on the HCM side, we benefited from upper single-digit pays per control. So that was helpful. Now that's not surprising. We had a pretty big decline in the first quarter. But in addition to that, there was pricing and also client base growth. So all of those were driving that result.
On the HR Outsourcing side, we simply had a great year last year, had more worksite employees served, and that drove that result. And then on retirement services, Marty talked about that. Retirement services is gaining steam across the country, and we are certainly benefiting from it with mandates in multiple states now. Our PEP product, we feel -- we are and I don't feel it, we believe it and see it, that we're well positioned.
So when you look at all of those 3, it took all of those 3 to drive that result. It wasn't solely an HCM story. And I think it plays to the fact that we sell in an integrated way, and we've benefited from that in terms of the point that Marty made earlier, which is we're getting better revenue per client."

I mean, clearly, just -- I'm just going to ask one question, but just maybe weave in the client growth, right? I mean, you picked up 75,000 clients. That's 11% growth. I don't think you've ever done that. So I mean, it seems like the business is poised for structurally higher growth.

So Kevin, I'd say the 75,000 is probably over a period of years. We disclosed that we were up above 710,000 and we had been in the high 600s a year before. But to your point, directionally, our client growth has been strong over the past several year",275,"Yes. So Kevin, I'd say the 75,000 is probably over a period of years. We disclosed that we were up above 710,000 and we had been in the high 600s a year before. But to your point, directionally, our client growth has been strong over the past several years, in part impacted by this move to digital that Marty talked about. So that's one part.
The second part is that the move to digital brings with it the ability to operate at higher levels of efficiency, which is what you're seeing in the P&L. So that's a big emphasis within the company. And I would say shout out to all of my colleagues in operations who've done a phenomenal job, and to the IT and product group who also make that happen. Can't happen any other way. So I'd say that's the second point.
And then the third point, Kevin, to your point, last year, we ended it, as I mentioned to folks on the call, we were in the high 80s in terms of revenue retention. There is a natural ceiling on the amount of revenue growth -- I'm sorry, revenue retention we can have because of some of the markets that we operate in, meaning that the smaller clients tend to attrit more rapidly than larger clients, but all of that moved up.
Previous to the pandemic, final point, we were in the 83% to 84% range. I would say that's the new Mendoza Line for retention. And last year, we beat that. We hope to beat that and build off of that, and all of my colleagues in operations share that goal."

They can answer that. They hear about that on their mobile phone. They can hear about it from their smart speaker.
So meaning that -- and we're tied in now -- we're the only company tied into all 3 of the major voice-assisted platforms. So it's saying, ""Your paystub is ready if you'd like to check it,"" and you can respond that you have checked it. I think of the efficiency that it brings the employer and the administrator of the employer, of the client and the employee as well now is, this is really helping continue our retention at the levels that Efrain is talking about.
Even though there's business failures in small business that keeps us at some point, at some level, this is really taking it to the highest level. And that, on top of the COVID work that we did and the ability to update them and really provide support and dollars through the like Employee Retention Tax Credit, is making a big difference.
And it's really a very different company. It is a software-driven company that is using artificial intelligence and data analytics to give a tremendous amount of efficiency to our clients."

And so now the insurance plans, your health insurance et cetera, your dental, your voluntary insurances, they're becoming very much a competitive offering to attract employees in a tough market and retain those that you have.

But that has definitely come down as a percentage, and digital has gone up as a percentage. I would say it's been a pretty steady change, and I expect it will probably even accelerate.
So much more of our lead generation comes now from the marketing investments that we make, and marketing has become a very important part of the sales function and how sales gets their leads and then, frankly, how clients view us and then come in online and just decide to buy.
As I mentioned, many clients now, certainly under 10 employees at least, can come into our website because they've seen us advertise somewhere or online through SEM and SEO and know that we're an expert in this field, come in, demo the product, compare the product and even buy the product and start to set themselves up.
So yes, it's becoming a bigger -- certainly a bigger part of it. And of course, that leads to efficiencies that Efrain has been talking about."

Because you could see some of the states had cut the extra unemployment benefit out, and it really was not making a big difference in the who was going back to work.
So I think what you're finding is it's going to take a little bit longer in the market. It's definitely still a tough hiring market. And I think that the cash balances, everyone -- you can see this data, cash balances are high, checking accounts are high because people haven't either spent or they also have gotten other stimulus money, whether it's child care or child tax -- or I'm sorry, child benefits that they're getting right now.
People are in a pretty good stage, and I think they're still trying to test it out. Plus, I think there's just still health care worries about their businesses that they're going back to. Do they have to wear masks? Is there a mandate or not? And I think it's going to take a couple more months to shake out.
It's certainly -- the hiring has gotten better. Our hiring growth is -- the hiring growth in our small business index has gotten much stronger in the last couple of months, especially in leisure and hospitality sectors and in other services sectors.

John Gibson, who runs all of services, had done a great job with our HR team to find very creative ways, though the hiring has really picked back up. We've shifted to some different ways to encourage new employees to come in, different work schedules, different abilities, certainly work from home and a number of other benefits that they can get in the tools and support that they have.
So it's picking back up now, particularly just in the last 30 days, but as Efrain said, it's a tough market out there to hire, particularly frontline service people. But as we said, we still are seeing very strong client retention. We're getting the job done, and we're certainly driving more calls to the website, which our chatbot, our automated response to service questions and other questions are being answered 60% of the time by the automated response.

But if you look at our gross margins and compare against industry, we still are right at the top. And that's against the people who are ""pure software players."" So look at the data, that's what I would say. We're proud of that. We understand that. We manage to that.
To your point, when I look at the data, and I mentioned, I think in response to an earlier question, it might have been Ramsey's question about the strength in Management Solutions, what was really notable about that was that it was widespread across the 3 major buckets of Management Solutions: retirement, HR and HCM. And what we're seeing is that our sales team has done a really good job of selling the entire, we call, value proposition of the company through what we call the power of 3,000. And the idea is that when we get in front of a client, we want to sell them the entirety of that value proposition.
Now just one small digression on that point. You can only do that if you've got an integrated system, not just HCM, but integrated ancillaries. So when you sell that proposition and now you've upgraded to a module, there's essentially very, very low variable costs associated with that. And that's really what's helping to drive what we see. We are -- we have been selling a bit higher in terms of client size, but more importantly, we have been selling more modules especially on high-value ancillaries like HR. So you're right. All of that is driving the improved margin performance that you're seeing."

You won't see that -- we don't think you'll see that in future quarters. So that's going to present a little bit of a compare issue.
We did have better pricing in the quarter than we had versus the pandemic-impacted quarter last year. So what happened is we did take steps in that first quarter of last year to hold off on price increases until we had a chance to let our customers take a breather. That was unique to the quarter. And as we anniversaried it, that helped.
And then the third thing is that clients were -- our client count was up significantly versus where we started the year last year. All of those things made Q1. The confluence of those things were really important.
And then finally, HR really took off in the first quarter of last year. We saw the strength through the remainder of the year. But when you got to first quarter, now you saw the full annualized impact of that strength in HR. Hey, Bryan, there's an element of conservatism in our numbers. We'll see where we end up, but it won't -- we're not going to have the same revenue growth in the second quarter.

We hear this time and time again that they were at a very dire point of going out of business, yet we helped them get the loans.

You're seeing the best job growth from a macro standpoint and from our -- some of our sales in Florida, in Georgia, in Texas, where there is -- but that is also a function of great demand, right, that's going there.
And there's more people there, migrating there, as everyone knows. And so you're seeing more businesses open up there. You're seeing more people available to fill jobs, that's helping more demand, that's increasing checks per payroll, that kind of thing. So I would say, no, I'm sure that has had some impact. But overall, states like Florida have actually been quite positive."

It's just a staggered approach as it's going out now, but I think something like that will have big efficiency gains for clients, which will help a lot on retention. We're not looking -- we're not charging additional cost for that, revenue for that, that's part of the service that a client opts in for.
But when you hear that clients are trying to be more efficient, it's things like that, that are really going to help on the retention and I think the revenue per client, so what -- the kind of price and the ability we get from that. So we're very excited about that one.
Also that it is tied to the technology. It's tied to smart speakers. We're the only company tied to all 3 major voice assistant platforms. This is just a whole new way for clients to be able to handle things with their employees, to say, ""Hey, your paycheck is ready. Would you like to check it, your paystub?""
Or from an employer standpoint, that you get an Alexa that's telling you, ""Hey, you have 3 things to do today as an employer."" I mean these kind of things are really tying much better retention than anything. And the Retention Insights, for example, really just uses the artificial intelligence to a great deal.
You can check not only pay, but you can look at -- we look at like 15, 20 different indicators that are in the payroll, in the system, in the software that will say, ""Here's your performance rating of this person. Here's -- their pay is below the national average based on BLS, and their pay is below the rest of the team that have this job category of your own company. Hey, watch out on the dashboard, this person may be likely to leave you.""
When clients start seeing that, it's not as much about the revenue directly from that software, it's from the retention of saying, ""I can't live without this,"" just like the mobile app has been like that for us. They have a five-star mobile app that employees don't want to leave because it's easy to use and they can do so many things themselves. It's great from a retention standpoint.
So we're really excited about the level of speed that we're putting out software enhancements and the strength of being much more of a technology company and software company and that, that's leading to retention."

And as Efrain mentioned, you know we're fully integrated, so we can provide everything on one solution, Flex, right from retirement to insurance, to HR and payroll. So it's not necessarily where you might go to a competitor that says, ""Hey, I'm going to pass you to somebody else to do the retirement or pass you to somebody else to do this.""

I mean I think many of the things that we've talked about have really helped clients. You can go right from a financial perspective, which is the employee retention tax credits, giving them dollars in their pocket to pay more for existing employees or pay to attract employees. So we go right at them to help them with their own financial situation.
Then when you look at from the product standpoint -- from the product standpoint, you have all of these things, benefit plans, retirement plans, HR guidance and support. Many companies, 25, 30 employees still don't really have the great HR support knowledge that they need to be able to -- how do I attract? And one that I haven't even mentioned today, which is really important is we've had this partnership with Indeed.
We have a very fully integrated partnership with Indeed, which is the largest -- the world's largest job posting system. And we actually -- a client can go out and post on Indeed, they actually get a credit because they're with Paychex with Indeed for the first couple of postings. They can go out on that job board, post that.
If someone applies for that job, they give their demographic information, obviously, in the application. If that's accepted, that comes over with no need to then put that into our system again. It transfers over through API. So we also think we've helped them by getting them in front of the biggest job posting system and making it easy for them to post the job through Flex, place it on Indeed, somebody applies, it comes back from Indeed, self-populates really if their person is hired into the payroll system and the HR system and everything is set.
So we've made it easy as much as we can for clients to hire and then retain by giving them the benefits and so forth to keep that employee. So we're very proud of the Indeed partnership and what that does, not only gives them a little financial incentive and some discounts on their postings, but it really makes it easy for them to post. And these are companies, even 5 employees to 50, that still struggle sometimes with where to post for a job.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. 
I will start today with an update on the business highlights for the second quarter, then Efrain will review our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22. We will then open it up for your questions. 
Today, we reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues increased double digits year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25%. We continued to have strong momentum from the first quarter with positive trends across the entire business. 
Client bases across all major solutions have continued to grow. Sales performance for the second quarter was strong across the board, resulting in our highest year-over-year growth in new annualized revenue in over 5 years and in fact, a record high level of annualized revenue sold for the second quarter and the first half of the year. 
The investments we've made in our technology, product, sales and digital marketing have positioned us well for success in today's environment. Our client retention remains near record levels. This is reflective of both the resilience of small businesses in the U.S. and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. 
Macroeconomic tailwinds persisted and resulting in strong growth in checks per payroll and increases in worksite employees in our HR outsourcing clients. The tight labor market and war for talent has been very challenging for all businesses. In response, Paychex, ourselves, we've taken proactive steps implementing incentives and programs to compete for talent, and we've made significant progress in hiring over the past quarter, and we're well prepared heading into the calendar year-end and selling season. 
COVID-19 and its variance continue to pressure businesses of all sizes, and we constantly enhance our robust set of COVID-19-related solutions. Most recently, within 10 days of the legislation surrounding COVID-19 vaccination and testing, we introduced a digital solution that businesses can leverage to confidentially capture and store employee vaccination status and request testing results for the unvaccinated. 
To help our clients stay up to date on all federal and state regulatory changes, we continue to introduce new methods of communication to proactively keep them informed and educated through white papers, webinars, videos and our podcast series On the Mark. We closely monitor topics that may have a significant impact on our clients such as vaccine management, updated guidance on employee retention tax credit, or ERTC, and the return of mask mandates in specific states. We remain a trusted resource to support small and midsized businesses. 
The trends we saw accelerate during the pandemic continue, including the need for HR advice, the need to upgrade employee benefits and retirement solutions to attract and retain talent and the acceleration of digital technology solutions to support a distributed workforce and tools to help businesses maximize available stimulus from the government. We've seen the benefits of these trends and strong demand for our HR solutions, another business that is benefiting from strong demand is our retirement business, where we have reached the 100,000 client milestone. As a leader in this space, we are uniquely positioned to help businesses meet the growing number of state mandates for retirement plans and provide a critical benefit offering to drive employee retention and satisfaction. 
In fact, in January, we were one of the first to release a PEP plan or pooled employer plan and 11 months later, not even a year later, we now have over 10,000 PEP clients. The access to stimulus funding has been a powerful retention tool for Paychex. We're proud that we've been able to help clients obtain billions in Paycheck Protection Program loans, and approximately 90% of our clients have leveraged our award-winning PPP forgiveness tool to gain some or all level of forgiveness for those loans, effectively transitioning the PPP loan into a grant. 
We've also helped businesses gain access to over $6 billion in employee retention and paid lead tax credits. Returns for clients, leveraging our ERTC service represent a significant amount for any business. Two of our most recent technology innovations focus on employee retention. Our retention insights offering use our tension insights offering uses predictive analytics based on a few dozen unique data elements to help employers identify employees who may be more likely to consider leaving their organization. This is Paychex's first client-facing predictive analytic and could not come at a better time given today's competitive labor market. 
We also introduced a completely enhanced total compensation summary that can be used by employers to communicate the impact of their total pay and benefits packages for employees. These are just 2 examples of the powerful technology and use of information we're providing to help employers compete and retain talent. 
We continue to enhance our technology solutions to deliver efficiency for our clients, their employees and paychecks through self-service and chat bots. Use of our cloud-based applications continues to grow with double-digit increases in both desktop and mobile devices. During our recent open enrollment period for our PEO clients, for example, 99% of our PEO worksite employees completed their open enrollment digitally, resulting in a 26% reduction in call volume. 
Our continued emphasis on expanding the digital capabilities of Paychex Flex was validated by several recent awards. We were named by Nelson Hall, a leading global analyst research firm, as a leader in their Annual Meet Vendor Evaluation Report for Human Capital Management. Paychex placed in the leader quadrant of the next-generation, HCM Technology report. This designation was based on our ability to deliver immediate client benefits and meet clients' future requirements. 
In addition, Brandon Hall Group was just -- has just recognized Paychex Flex with 2 excellence and technology awards. Our ERTC service was recognized in the category of Best Advance in HR and Workforce Management Technology for small and midsized businesses, and Paychex Pre-Check was recognized in the category of business strategy and technology innovation. This is our ninth consecutive year we've been recognized for our technology in this award program, the largest and longest-running award program in the HCM space. 
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the recent change in executive leadership roles that took effect on December 1. I have assumed the role of Chairman of the Board and will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Tom Golisano, our founder and prior Chairman, will remain a Board member and will continue to play a role in the governance and oversight of the company. John Gibson, our Senior Vice President of Service since 2013, has been promoted to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been an integral part of our executive team and has led the service and operations of all Paychex businesses divisions, including HR outsourcing, payroll, retirement and insurance there remains continuity in leadership to drive Paychex of the future, and I'd like to thank Tom for his leadership and for his continued support as we move forward and wish Jon well in our future growth. 
In summary, we are proud of our performance during the second quarter. We are well positioned with our set of innovative technology and service solutions for the selling season and to continue providing industry-leading value to our clients. 
I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?"

I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore, involve some risk. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures referred to the customary disclosures. So let me start by providing key points for the quarter, follow up with greater detail in certain areas, and I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook. .
Our second quarter results reflected strong internal execution and continued economic recovery. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 13% to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to $832 million, driven primarily by growth in client bases across our portfolio of solutions, higher revenue per client and improved employment levels. 
Client-based growth resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, our HR Solutions business continues to benefit from strong demand as biz look for more HR support. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 11% to $262 million. Our PEO has benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment. 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter. The $14 million is the impact of lower average interest rates and realized gains was partially offset by a 9% increase in average investment balances. Total expenses were up 6% to $668 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs and increased in benefit costs to our employees and continued investment in our products, technology, sales and marketing. 
Op income increased 24% to $440 million with an operating margin of 39.7%. Adjusted operating margin was also 39.7% in the second quarter compared with 36.1% for the prior year period, an expansion of 360 basis points. 
Our effective income tax rate was 24% compared to 22.1% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25% for the quarter to $330 million and $0.91 per share, respectively. 
Year-to-date results, I'll touch on the highlights briefly here. This is for the 6-month period, obviously, ending November 30. Total service revenue and total revenue increased 15% and 14%, respectively, to $2.2 billion. Expenses, excluding onetime costs incurred during the prior year increased 5%. Op income and adjusted op income were $883 million, increases of 38% and 32%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $1.83 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.80 per share. 
Let's talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.1 billion and total borrowings of approximately $800 million as of November 30. Cash flows from operations were $555 million during the first 6 months, an increase of 29% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $459 million, up 21% year-over-year. Increases were driven by higher net income, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. We've paid out quarterly dividends at $0.66 per share for a total of $476 million during the first 6 months. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was 43%. 
Now I'll turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter. We've taken that into account in the second quarter results, and our second quarter results actually exceeded expectations. We have some conservatism given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevails during the remainder of the year. We provided the following updated guidance, as you saw. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We've previously guided to a growth of approximately 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We previously guided to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We previously guided to growth of approximately 8%. 
Adjusted op income is expected to be in the range of 39% to 40%, up from the previous guidance of 38% to 39%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 44%, up from the previous guidance of approximately 43%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $23 million to $26 million, with the change due to certain nonoperating income received during the second quarter. 
Our effective income tax is still expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected now to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. We previously guided the growth of 12% to 14%. 
Turning to the third quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 9%, and we are expecting an adjusted operating margin of approximately 42%. So a note that in your models. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were impacted by timing of notification of changes in state unemployment insurance rates. This creates comparability issues for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, doesn't affect the whole year. You'll look at our investor presentation when we post it in a little bit, and we provided additional details so you can get the split of the quarters correct. 
Of course, everything that I just said is subject to our current assumptions, which could change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the third quarter call. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Marty."

And I'll let Efrain jump in, too. I think there's really 2 parts to it. One is we've been down some head count temporary as a challenging hiring, but we really picked up a lot of hires in the second quarter due to some creative things we did. But I would say, overall, the bigger impact is that we have automated a lot of the service models. When you look at it and you think about chatbots, when someone comes on the web, now to ask a question, over 60% of the questions are being answered in an automated fashion with a chatbot before they go to anyone live. 
And also, as I mentioned in my comments, if you just think about the things we've done with Flex in our PEO offering, 99%, almost 100% of PEO employees, worksite employees handled open enrollment online digitally now, and that reduced calling in for questions and issues by over 25%. So a lot of the things we're doing not only with the product but with the service models themselves have reduced the number of calls that are coming in, not only are they clients happier, they're getting a faster answer and it's being done the way they want to receive it, which is either automatically or through chat, et cetera, but also we're saving expense in time in allowing our specialists to handle more value-added calls for the clients. 
So is there a wider range? I think there's always a little bit wider range. And that's our DNA is to kind of drive margin as best we can. I would say a little is temporary, but most of it is the things that we've been doing year after year."

There's a couple of benefits, not only does it reduces costs, it allows the client to onboard themselves at their pace. And it also really it creates a lot fewer errors and interactions with the service team because the client is doing it at their own pace and when they want to do it and how they want to do it. And the last thing is that, frankly, many times is a better sale if you're buying online digitally and then you start sell onboarding yourself, and you might need to help.

I really still think, as I said last quarter, that we will kind of even out at some place better than we were pre pandemic. And I think a number of things that are helping that.

What we're seeing is the value, we're not seeing as many leaving for price value kind of category because they're seeing the value of the product, especially at the time of COVID with all the value we're bringing them from the product side, from the technology, handling a distributed workforce, with all of the mobile apps that we have and ability and now the retention tools that we're giving them and the paycheck pre-check, where we're allowing the employees to review and approve kind of their own pay before it even gets processed.

Insurance is a tale of 2 cities. The health and benefit side grew upper single digits and -- but work comp still remains a really tough compare because that market continues to be soft. .
I probably am going on 4 or 5 years of talking about softness in workers' comp. It is good to say at least has moderated to the point where you were flat year-over-year. But increasingly, it's a smaller and smaller part of the business, but it hasn't bounced back yet. So doing very well, let's say, health and benefits on the insurance side doing well. Workers' comp kind of creating a situation that moderates the overall amount. Hopefully, as we get into next year if that will start to turn around.

So if you look at Management Solutions and you kind of apply kind of a broad umbrella of what's in that revenue stream, you really have 3 important components, as many of you know. You've got HCM solutions that are roughly about a little bit under half of that revenue stream. But then I would say there's 2 other parts that we don't talk about as much, but increasingly have become very, very important, which are the combination of retirement services and also what we would call ASO or HR outsourcing. This is not PEO. 
So if you look at that -- those 2 in comparison to HCM, they're now almost 50% of what HCM is. And they're growing at rates that are faster than HCM. HCM had a very strong quarter. It's not that it didn't. It's just that retirement services and HR outsourcing had even stronger, even stronger quarters. 
Now those are not onetime things. There's demand in the environment for both retirement services. I think Marty mentioned pet plans, et cetera. and our success there. We are -- it's pretty clear we're leading the market in terms of selling that product. If you look at -- if you trace a step back, we didn't release it, but you trace that back to our sales. Sales have been very strong. And on the HR outsourcing area, solution side, that's been very strong, too. 
Both of those are driven by unique factors in the market, HR, because of the uncertainty of the environment, the demand is -- the value proposition has never been higher. And as a consequence, demand is very strong. And on the retirement side, there are increasing amounts of states that are mandating retirement plans for employees that have benefited our business, and that continues to grow strongly. 
So whatever I just said. I've said that a lot of the demand forces within Management Solutions, obviously have benefited from a pandemic rebound. But if I isolate HR Outsourcing and retirement services, those are responding to other forces in the economy that we think are pretty durable. So long story short, there isn't a lot of onetime in there. There are some things. The rebound certainly is part of it, but there are also structural demand -- or structural factors that are driving demand higher."

And when you look across the board, Efrain mentioned, between time and attendance, but HR Solutions in a COVID environment is so critically important and the technology that we've introduced on the mobile app, so the ability to really handle distributed workforces to be able to track vaccinations and those who are unvaccinated. All these things are part of a digital experience that clients are really seeing. So I think most of it is sustainable growth that we're seeing. 
Even the macro that you're seeing, more checks and so forth, should be sustainable unless there's a drop-off because of the variant in the next year, but we don't see that. And still there's room to grow. There's a lot of people that are still not employed. And we expect that could pick up next -- in the first part of the half of the next calendar year."

And our price realization in this environment when you triangulate the retention plus the extra -- the additional value added in terms of services sold, we've been able to do very, very well. 
One thing we haven't talked about, which I don't want to forget in this process, one of the strengths of our model is that we are really very, very quick. And Marty mentioned this earlier. We're very, very agile in terms or responding to 2 new opportunities that come up as a result of changes in legislation. So we mentioned that there's this service we call employee retention tax credit. 
We have, I think, throughout the pandemic, shown agility in terms of responding very quickly and creating value-added products and services for our clients. That's helped both, to raise our average revenue per client, also helped us to get -- to justify the price realization that we've done. 
Marty said that we've been losing very few clients, too, because of dissatisfaction with value and price in its part because we keep raising the value of what we're providing to clients, and they've responded very well."

I think the last year or so we ran into great presentations, but people are not making decisions. And I think we're now going back at those, and we're winning a lot of these deals against competitors. Just won a big one yesterday and really doing well against the competitors that are out there. I think because of the product work that's been done and the technology that is really fitting exactly what they need at the moment. 
As Efrain said, the agility to be able to turn around things like employee retention insights, the fact that we can give them new compensation summaries for their clients for their employees, whatever they needed, we're feeling like we're kind of a step ahead. And in the mid-market, in particular, they're really feeling the pinch and retention and attraction of new employees, and we're able to do that. 
And remember, we talked about it on other calls, this partnership we have with Indeed where you are connected digitally through Paychex Flex to Indeed, the world's largest hosting site, you get a credit on Indeed. Indeed, you can post the job electronically, digitally, then if they respond to the post. It goes right into their system. If you hire them, everything is paperless. These are all things that mid-market clients in particular right now need, and we've been ahead of it and really hats off to the product management and development teams. I mean we have just been a step ahead of everything they need. So I think that is -- and then the power of the sales team really has come through."

But it really was fueled an important measure by retention, which, as Marty mentioned earlier, was at record levels. We still continue to have very good retention. That's been great, but our sales performance has been really strong this year. So a combination of both of those is really what's driving. I would say it tilts a little bit more towards the sales side rather than the retention side, but both have been strong."

They have the option if the client and the rep agree to get together, more of them are doing that. And I think even with the variant, I think they're still doing that. But many of the presentations, now particularly in the mid-market, can be done virtually and really I think we've really fine-tuned that through this time. And the sales engineering team and so forth, they've just done a great job in kind of building out sandboxes and different examples for a client that are very personalized to the client to say, this is what you're going to get, this is how you work through it. And frankly, it's probably easier to do it virtually and digitally than it is in front of the client because they can all see it right in front of them, and they can take them through it. 
So yes, I don't think it will affect us. We're well staffed. We're great products, everything is really moving very well. So it feels very strong right now. But we'll know at the end of the selling season, but we feel pretty good right now with the momentum."

We're seeing continued growth, job growth for 6 months in a row now. So the job growth is good. Now we're still, as you know, what around a 61% participation rate, I think, which is down a couple of percentage points from pre-pandemic. We're still short around 4 million jobs from pre-pandemic. 1.5 million of those are in leisure and hospitality. 
So I would say the ones that are still struggling the most are the restaurants and you probably know everyone kind of sees that anecdotally from cutback hours or even closed a few more days than they normally would. I think that's where still the biggest struggle has been. And it's a combination of the pay, which has gone up dramatically. We're seeing average part-time pay for our client base, part time pay per hour is $19.62 last month. It's an amazing thing when you think 2 years ago, everybody was arguing about getting to $15. 
So it is more costly. The supplies are more costly as well. But I think from an employment perspective, that's probably the one that's suffering the most. But I do think that as things change now and some of the stimulus money dries up, the unemployment has changed, of course, back to more normal levels. The child tax credit may end up going away as well. That's in arguments. You got to pay your tuition payments. Now they've been deferred, many of them rent. I think you're going to see more people come back in the first and second quarter, would be our guess based on what we're hearing from clients. 
So they've seen growth, but there's still a lot of people that are still sitting on the sidelines. But I think as depending on what the market does and of course, just kind of overall cash balances, as things all come together, we expect more people to be higher in the next 6 months as that continues to pick up."

One is, I'll make a statement and a philosophy about what the company does and then answer the question. The first thing is that I think you're right, Kartik. Typically in the late spring, we actually used to broadcast that, which I was not a big fan of, but we typically would look at it in late spring and raise it. I would say in the pandemic, we really have adopted a little bit more flexible timing. So we don't necessarily say we're going to do it in April, May or we're going to do it in June, July, and we look at what the circumstances are and then decide when it's right to plug in a price increase. So that's the first part. .
I think that from our perspective, we think it's important to be fair to customers. I think we're guided by that thought. The fact that we can take 2 or even more price increases does not determine whether we will because in the end, we value our relationship with clients. Our job is to create value that supports the price increase. And much of what Marty has been saying during this call, I think, is an indication of that. 
And so we'll take a look in the spring, figure out what makes sense. We certainly don't want to create a situation where clients perceive that they're not getting the value for what we're charging. On the other hand, we test ourselves with creating greater and greater value for clients so that when we do pass increases along, they don't complain about it. And generally, that's what occurs."

I don't have that number right in front of me, Kartik, but I think we continue to try to watch that to see and we know the average employees.

And then I think that, that also attracts people. Then the full benefit, the full HR solution that I just said, the benefits of retirement and all of the other benefits, insurance benefits, this is really attracting more people and retaining the clients. So that is all things that we can offer, not only from a full solution set, but from a technology standpoint that really attracts a generation that is out there deciding where they want to work today. 
They want things on their mobile app. The Paychex Flex mobile app is full featured. You can have your retirement, your insurance, your pay stubs, you have now Pre-Check. You're working for somebody who you feel like not only has full benefits, but they're a leader in technology when you use our products.

And in fact, many smaller players try to cope a very comprehensive website from marketing that puts all the information we have to do, where you have to do it. 
And then here's the products that will help you with that from a technology and a service standpoint. So I think it's really been more difficult on the regional players today that just don't have the breadth of service, knowledge or compliance people to be able to keep up with this. We have over 200 compliance experts that follow every single thing that's happening that may happen so that we can be as agile, as Efrain mentioned earlier, on creating these products almost as soon as the issues come out.

So there's going to be some -- there's some mandates there that will have penalties that are starting to be enacted. Some are in place already in California, I think, coming up in June. So there's a lot of attraction there to people not only looking at it from that standpoint but also just from a hiring standpoint and a full benefits there's a lot of interest, as I've mentioned, in having a full suite of benefits for the well-being of the employees that's helping retain them and attract them in a difficult market. So it's retirement, it's insurance, it's what's your work-from-home policy, your hybrid policy of working in office and home, it's all those things kind of combined. It's not just compensation. So that's really picked up, and we've had -- continue to have a very strong retirement sales and the fact that we offer a multitude of products, and we just went over 100,000 clients I mentioned earlier.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.  
I will start today with an update on the business highlights for the second quarter, then Efrain will review our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22. We will then open it up for your questions.  
Today, we reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues increased double digits year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25%. We continued to have strong momentum from the first quarter with positive trends across the entire business.  
Client bases across all major solutions have continued to grow. Sales performance for the second quarter was strong across the board, resulting in our highest year-over-year growth in new annualized revenue in over 5 years and in fact, a record high level of annualized revenue sold for the second quarter and the first half of the year.  
The investments we've made in our technology, product, sales and digital marketing have positioned us well for success in today's environment. Our client retention remains near record levels. This is reflective of both the resilience of small businesses in the U.S. and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Macroeconomic tailwinds persisted and resulting in strong growth in checks per payroll and increases in worksite employees in our HR outsourcing clients. The tight labor market and war for talent has been very challenging for all businesses. In response, Paychex, ourselves, we've taken proactive steps implementing incentives and programs to compete for talent, and we've made significant progress in hiring over the past quarter, and we're well prepared heading into the calendar year-end and selling season.  
COVID-19 and its variance continue to pressure businesses of all sizes, and we constantly enhance our robust set of COVID-19-related solutions. Most recently, within 10 days of the legislation surrounding COVID-19 vaccination and testing, we introduced a digital solution that businesses can leverage to confidentially capture and store employee vaccination status and request testing results for the unvaccinated. To help our clients stay up to date on all federal and state regulatory changes, we continue to introduce new methods of communication to proactively keep them informed and educated through white papers, webinars, videos and our podcast series On the Mark. 
We closely monitor topics that may have a significant impact on our clients such as vaccine management, updated guidance on employee retention tax credit, or ERTC, and the return of mask mandates in specific states. We remain a trusted resource to support small and midsized businesses.  
The trends we saw accelerate during the pandemic continue, including the need for HR advice, the need to upgrade employee benefits and retirement solutions to attract and retain talent and the acceleration of digital technology solutions to support a distributed workforce and tools to help businesses maximize available stimulus from the government. We've seen the benefits of these trends and strong demand for our HR solutions, another business that is benefiting from strong demand is our retirement business, where we have reached the 100,000 client milestone. As a leader in this space, we are uniquely positioned to help businesses meet the growing number of state mandates for retirement plans and provide a critical benefit offering to drive employee retention and satisfaction.  
In fact, in January, we were one of the first to release a PEP plan or pooled employer plan and 11 months later, not even a year later, we now have over 10,000 PEP clients. The access to stimulus funding has been a powerful retention tool for Paychex. We're proud that we've been able to help clients obtain billions in Paycheck Protection Program loans, and approximately 90% of our clients have leveraged our award-winning PPP forgiveness tool to gain some or all level of forgiveness for those loans, effectively transitioning the PPP loan into a grant.  
We've also helped businesses gain access to over $6 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. Returns for clients, leveraging our ERTC service represent a significant amount for any business. Two of our most recent technology innovations focus on employee retention. Our Retention Insights offering use -- our Retention Insights offering uses predictive analytics based on a few dozen unique data elements to help employers identify employees who may be more likely to consider leaving their organization. This is Paychex's first client-facing predictive analytic and could not come at a better time given today's competitive labor market.  
We also introduced a completely enhanced total compensation summary that can be used by employers to communicate the impact of their total pay and benefits packages for employees. These are just 2 examples of the powerful technology and use of information we're providing to help employers compete and retain talent.  
We continue to enhance our technology solutions to deliver efficiency for our clients, their employees and Paychex through self-service and chat bots. Use of our cloud-based applications continues to grow with double-digit increases in both desktop and mobile devices. During our recent open enrollment period for our PEO clients, for example, 99% of our PEO worksite employees completed their open enrollment digitally, resulting in a 26% reduction in call volume.  
Our continued emphasis on expanding the digital capabilities of Paychex Flex was validated by several recent awards. We were named by NelsonHall, a leading global analyst research firm as a leader in their Annual NEAT vendor evaluation report for human capital management. Paychex placed in the leader quadrant of the next-generation, HCM technology report. This designation was based on our ability to deliver immediate client benefits and meet clients' future requirements.  
In addition, Brandon Hall Group was just -- has just recognized Paychex Flex with 2 excellence and technology awards. Our ERTC service was recognized in the category of Best Advance in HR and Workforce Management Technology for small and midsized businesses, and Paychex Pre-Check was recognized in the category of business strategy and technology innovation. This is our ninth consecutive year we've been recognized for our technology in this award program, the largest and longest-running award program in the HCM space.  
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the recent change in executive leadership roles that took effect on December 1. I have assumed the role of Chairman of the Board and will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Tom Golisano, our founder and prior Chairman, will remain a Board member and will continue to play a role in the governance and oversight of the company. John Gibson, our Senior Vice President of Service since 2013, has been promoted to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been an integral part of our executive team and has led the service and operations of all Paychex businesses divisions, including HR outsourcing, payroll, retirement and insurance. There remains continuity in leadership to drive Paychex to the future, and I'd like to thank Tom for his leadership and for his continued support as we move forward and wish John well in our future growth.  
In summary, we are proud of our performance during the second quarter. We are well positioned with our set of innovative technology and service solutions for the selling season and to continue providing industry-leading value to our clients.  
I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?"

So let me start by providing key points for the quarter, follow up with greater detail in certain areas, and I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook. 
Our second quarter results reflected strong internal execution and continued economic recovery. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 13% to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to $832 million, driven primarily by growth in client bases across our portfolio of solutions, higher revenue per client and improved employment levels.  
Client-based growth resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, our HR Solutions business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR support. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 11% to $262 million. Our PEO has benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment.
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter. The $14 million is the impact of lower average interest rates and realized gains was partially offset by a 9% increase in average investment balances. Total expenses were up 6% to $668 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs and increased in benefit costs to our employees and continued investment in our products, technology, sales and marketing.  
Op income increased 24% to $440 million with an operating margin of 39.7%. Adjusted operating margin was also 39.7% in the second quarter compared with 36.1% for the prior year period, an expansion of 360 basis points.  
Our effective income tax rate was 24% compared to 22.1% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25% for the quarter to $330 million and $0.91 per share, respectively.  
Year-to-date results, I'll touch on the highlights briefly here. This is for the 6-month period, obviously, ending November 30. Total service revenue and total revenue increased 15% and 14%, respectively, to $2.2 billion. Expenses, excluding onetime costs incurred during the prior year increased 5%. Op income and adjusted op income were $883 million, increases of 38% and 32%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $1.83 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.80 per share.  
Let's talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.1 billion and total borrowings of approximately $800 million as of November 30. Cash flows from operations were $555 million during the first 6 months, an increase of 29% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $459 million, up 21% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. We've paid out quarterly dividends at $0.66 per share for a total of $476 million during the first 6 months, our 12-month rolling return on equity was 43%.  
Now I'll turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter. We've taken that into account in the second quarter results, and our second quarter results actually exceeded expectations. We have some conservatism given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevails during the remainder of the year. We provided the following updated guidance, as you saw. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We've previously guided to a growth of approximately 8%. 
PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We previously guided to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We previously guided to growth of approximately 8%.  
Adjusted op income is expected to be in the range of 39% to 40%, up from the previous guidance of 38% to 39%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 44%, up from the previous guidance of approximately 43%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $23 million to $26 million, with the change due to certain nonoperating income received during the second quarter.  
Our effective income tax is still expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected now to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. We previously guided the growth of 12% to 14%.  
Turning to the third quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 9%, and we are expecting an adjusted operating margin of approximately 42%. So note that in your models. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were impacted by timing of notification of changes in state unemployment insurance rates. This creates comparability issues for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, doesn't affect the whole year. You'll look at our investor presentation when we post it in a little bit, and we provided additional details so you can get the split of the quarters correct.  
Of course, everything that I just said is subject to our current assumptions, which could change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the third quarter call.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Marty."

And I'll let Efrain jump in, too. I think there's really 2 parts to it. One is we've been down some head count temporary as a challenging hiring, but we really picked up a lot of hires in the second quarter due to some creative things we did. But I would say, overall, the bigger impact is that we have automated a lot of the service models. When you look at it and you think about chatbots, when someone comes on the web, now to ask a question, over 60% of the questions are being answered in an automated fashion with a chatbot before they go to anyone live.  
And also, as I mentioned in my comments, if you just think about the things we've done with Flex in our PEO offering, almost 100% of PEO employees, worksite employees handled open enrollment online digitally now, and that reduced calling in for questions and issues by over 25%. So a lot of the things we're doing not only with the product but with the service models themselves have reduced the number of calls that are coming in, not only are the clients happier, they're getting a faster answer and it's being done the way they want to receive it, which is either automatically or through chat, et cetera, but also we're saving expense and time in allowing our specialists to handle more value-added calls for the clients.  
So is there a wider range? I think there's always a little bit wider range. And that's our DNA is to kind of drive margin as best we can. I would say a little is temporary, but most of it is the things that we've been doing year after year."

There's more and more clients that can self-onboard themselves. I'd say we're still more -- we're newer into that process. But that is happening not only because it's good for our expenses, it's really good for the clients. The clients want to self-onboard. Share Payroll division has been doing this for some time and Flex is continuing to grow into that. So if it's particularly a smaller client, they want to start onboarding themselves.  
There's a couple of benefits, not only does it reduces costs, it allows the client to onboard themselves at their pace. And it also really it creates a lot fewer errors and interactions with the service team because the client is doing it at their own pace and when they want to do it and how they want to do it. And the last thing is that, frankly, many times is a better sale if you're buying online digitally and then you start self-onboarding yourself, and you might need to help. But if you don't, you complete that, it's better than multiple salespeople and service people talking to you to implement you. So we're definitely headed -- we're definitely down that path, more on the share payroll side, but Flex is increasing as well."

It wasn't quite as high as the record and that we saw in Q1, but it's very close to that. I really still think, as I said last quarter, that we will kind of even out at some place better than we were prepandemic. And I think a number of things that are helping that. There is fewer out of business. But there is also just the value of the product. 
What we're seeing is the value -- we're not seeing as many leaving for price value kind of category because they're seeing the value of the product, especially at the time of COVID with all the value we're bringing them from the product side, from the technology, handling a distributed workforce with all of the mobile apps that we have and ability and now the retention tools that we're giving them and the paycheck Pre-Check, where we're allowing the employees to review and approve kind of their own pay before it even gets processed. 
All these things we're getting back from clients are adding value, and that is doing exactly what we hoped, which is not only adding value to the client but improving retention. So we're near record levels in Q2. Don't see anything changing at this point in December. Of course, December, January is really where we'll see the number for year-end.

Insurance is a tale of 2 cities. The health and benefit side grew upper single digits and -- but work comp still remains a really tough compare because that market continues to be soft.
I probably am going on 4 or 5 years of talking about softness in workers' comp. It is good to say it at least has moderated to the point where you were flat year-over-year. But increasingly, it's a smaller and smaller part of the business, but it hasn't bounced back yet. So PEO doing very well. Let's say, health and benefits on the insurance side doing well. Workers' comp kind of creating a situation that moderates the overall amount. Hopefully, as we get into next year if that -- that will start to turn around.

So if you look at Management Solutions and you kind of apply kind of a broad umbrella of what's in that revenue stream, you really have 3 important components, as many of you know. You've got HCM solutions that are roughly about a little bit under half of that revenue stream. But then I would say there's 2 other parts that we don't talk about as much, but increasingly have become very, very important, which are the combination of retirement services and also what we would call ASO or HR outsourcing. This is not PEO.  
So if you look at that -- those 2 in comparison to HCM, they're now almost 50% of what HCM is. And they're growing at rates that are faster than HCM. Now HCM had a very strong quarter. It's not that it didn't. It's just that retirement services and HR outsourcing had even stronger, even stronger quarters.  
Now those are not onetime things. There's demand in the environment for both retirement services. I think Marty mentioned PEP plans, et cetera and our success there. We are -- it's pretty clear we're leading the market in terms of selling that product. If you look at -- if you trace that back, we didn't release it, but you trace that back to our sales, sales have been very strong. And on the HR outsourcing area, solution side, that's been very strong, too. Both of those are driven by unique factors in the market, HR, because of the uncertainty of the environment, the demand is -- the value proposition has never been higher. And as a consequence, demand is very strong. And on the retirement side, there are increasing amounts of states that are mandating retirement plans for employees that have benefited our business, and that continues to just grow strongly.  
So whatever I just said. I've said that a lot of the demand forces within Management Solutions, obviously have benefited from a pandemic rebound. But if I isolate HR outsourcing and retirement services, those are responding to other forces in the economy that we think are pretty durable. So long story short, there isn't a lot of onetime in there. There are some things. The rebound certainly is part of it, but there are also structural demands -- or structural factors that are driving demand higher."

We didn't necessarily expect retirement to be as strong as it is. And as I mentioned, our PEP product, we are one of the first that come out with the PEP product, the pooled employer plan back in just January of this year, so not even a year later, we're at 10,000 clients. We have sold that extremely well.  
And when you look across the board, Efrain mentioned, between time and attendance, but HR Solutions in a COVID environment is so critically important and the technology that we've introduced on the mobile app, so the ability to really handle distributed workforces to be able to track vaccinations and those who are unvaccinated. All these things are part of a digital experience that clients are really seeing. So I think most of it is sustainable growth that we're seeing.  
Even the macro that you're seeing, more checks and so forth, should be sustainable unless there's a drop-off because of the variant in the next year, but we don't see that. And still there's room to grow. There's a lot of people that are still not employed. And we expect that could pick up next -- in the first part -- half of the next calendar year."

But what it does is because of the segment of the market that we're in, we have relatively more pricing power than if you were in the enterprise space. Although I suspect they'll have more pricing power. So it gives us, in terms of our model, a measure of ability to price than may be a little bit higher than we have experienced in previous years to the extent that inflation also drives interest rates higher, that also has a benefit to the business.  
So obviously, there's a balance there in terms of if interest rates and inflation surge too high, could have a dampening effect on economic growth. But assuming it's under some reasonable level, it's going to be a net positive for the business."

From a price standpoint, I think we feel like we still have good price realization. And I don't think there's some pressure on it. But as Efrain mentioned, in this inflationary kind of time frame, I don't think it's, one, probably is difficult to get it as it was. And also, while it's still very competitive in the market, but also the value that we're bringing, I think will -- it's just not challenged as much given how much we've been able to do. 
If you just take something like employee retention, tax credit, we're bringing so much to our client at a relatively low cost that they're benefiting a lot. I think at that point, they're start -- they see more and more value that we bring through COVID that has helped us get even better price realization.

And our price realization in this environment when you triangulate the retention plus the extra -- the additional value added in terms of services sold, we've been able to do very, very well. 
One thing we haven't talked about, which I don't want to forget in this process, one of the strengths of our model is that we are really very, very quick. And Marty mentioned this earlier. We're very, very agile in terms of responding to 2 new opportunities that come up as a result of changes in legislation. So we mentioned that there's this service we call, employee retention tax credit. 
We have, I think, throughout the pandemic, shown agility in terms of responding very quickly and creating value-added products and services for our clients. That's helped both, to raise our average revenue per client, also helped us to get -- to justify the price realization that we've done. Marty said that we've been losing very few clients, too, because of the dissatisfaction with value and price in its part because we keep raising the value of what we're providing the clients, and they've responded very well."

I think because of the product work that's been done and the technology that is really fitting exactly what they need at the moment. 
As Efrain said, the agility to be able to turn around things like employee retention insights, the fact that we can give them new compensation summaries for their clients or for their employees, whatever they needed, we're feeling like we're kind of a step ahead. And in the mid-market, in particular, they're really feeling the pinch and retention and attraction of new employees, and we're able to do that. 
And remember, we talked about it on other calls, this partnership we have with Indeed where you are connected digitally through Paychex Flex to Indeed, the world's largest job posting site, you get a credit on Indeed. Indeed, you can post the job electronically, digitally, then if they respond to the post. It goes right into their system. If you hire them, everything is paperless. These are all things that mid-market clients in particular right now need, and we've been ahead of it and really hats off to the product management and development teams. I mean we have just been a step ahead of everything they need. So I think that is -- and then the power of the sales team really has come through."

But it really was fueled an important measure by retention, which, as Marty mentioned earlier, was at record levels. We still continue to have very good retention.

But so many of the presentations, now particularly in the mid-market even, can be done virtually and really I think we've really fine-tuned that through this time. 
And the sales engineering team and so forth, they've just done a great job in kind of building out sandboxes and different examples for a client that are very personalized for the client to say, this is what you're going to get, this is how you work through it. And frankly, it's probably easier to do it virtually and digitally than it is in front of the client because they can all see it right in front of them, and they can take them through it.

We're seeing continued growth, job growth for 6 months in a row now. So the job growth is good. Now we're still, as you know, what around a 61% participation rate, I think, which is down a couple of percentage points from prepandemic. We're still short around 4 million jobs from prepandemic, 1.5 million of those are in leisure and hospitality. 
So I would say the ones that are still struggling the most are the restaurants and you probably know everyone kind of sees that anecdotally from cutback hours or even closed a few more days than they normally would. I think that's where still the biggest struggle has been. And it's a combination of the pay, which has gone up dramatically. We're seeing average part-time pay for our client base, part time pay per hour is $19.62 last month. It's an amazing thing when you think 2 years ago, everybody was arguing about getting to $15. 
So it is more costly. The supplies are more costly as well. But I think from an employment perspective, that's probably the one that's suffering the most. But I do think that as things change now and some of the stimulus money dries up, the unemployment has changed, of course, back to more normal levels. The child tax credit may end up going away as well. That's in arguments. You got to pay your tuition payments. Now they've been deferred, many of them, rent. I think you're going to see more people come back in the first and second quarter, would be our guess based on what we're hearing from clients. 
So they've seen growth, but there's still a lot of people that are still sitting on the sidelines. But I think as -- depending on what the market does and of course, just kind of overall cash balances, as things all come together, we expect more people to be higher in the next 6 months as that continues to pick up."

One is, I'll make a statement of philosophy about what the company does and then answer the question. The first thing is that I think you're right, Kartik. Typically in the late spring, we actually used to broadcast that, which I was not a big fan of, but we typically would look at it in late spring and raise it. I would say in the pandemic, we really have adopted a little bit more flexible timing. So we don't necessarily say we're going to do it in April, May or we're going to do it in June, July, and we look at what the circumstances are and then decide when it's right to plug in a price increase. So that's the first part. 
I think that from our perspective, we think it's important to be fair to customers. I think we're guided by that thought. The fact that we can take 2 or even more price increases does not determine whether we will because in the end, we value our relationship with clients. Our job is to create value that supports the price increase. And much of what Marty has been saying during this call, I think, is an indication of that. 
And so we'll take a look in the spring, figure out what makes sense. We certainly don't want to create a situation where clients perceive that they're not getting the value for what we're charging. On the other hand, we task ourselves with creating greater and greater value for clients so that when we do pass them increases along, they don't complain about it.

I don't have that number right in front of me, Kartik, but I think we continue to try to watch that to see and we know the average employees. I think that definitely, we have some sense that it would obviously continue to benefit us from where it is.

I think we can -- we still got a lot of opportunity really to advance that as more people get used to it, and there's more demand for it. 
I think clients are a little concerned sometimes about offering it because they're not sure if that's going to have a cash flow impact, which it doesn't. And then the employees are not aware of it, and so they don't ask for it. I think you're going to see over the next -- it will take, I think, the next couple of years, but I think there'll be a very big demand for that as employees just say, hey, look, I want to get paid today. And I think you'll see a resurgence of more gig economy kind of thing where I'm working 2 or 3 jobs. And -- but they're all -- I want the money now because it's 8 hours here and 8 hours there.

So you can buy parts from other competitors. But you're going to have to connect to third parties. We can do that too. But if you want it all in one place and the HR expertise to back it up with over 650 HR experts, which people really like to have as a backup now, that's what they're seeing and is very strong.

And then I think that, that also attracts people. Then the full benefit, the full HR solution that I just said, the benefits of retirement and all of the other benefits, insurance benefits, this is really attracting more people and retaining the clients. So that is all things that we can offer, not only from a full solution set, but from a technology standpoint that really attracts a generation that is out there deciding where they want to work today. 
They want things on their mobile app. The Paychex Flex mobile app is full featured. You can have your retirement, your insurance, your pay stubs, you have now Pre-Check. You're working for somebody who you feel like not only has full benefits, but they're a leader in technology when you use our products.

We're net -- certainly net adding from a regional player perspective, meaning selling versus losing, I think many of the regional players are struggling in this environment to provide as many -- as much value through COVID. The speed at which regulations are changing and demands on small and midsized businesses for vaccination policy, the mandate what's the latest, you're going to get that from someone like us. And in fact, many smaller players try to copy our stuff up, the web we have, a very comprehensive website from marketing that puts all the information out, by state. Telling you what you have to do, where you have to do it. And then here's the products that will help you with that from a technology and a service standpoint. 
So I think it's really been more difficult on the regional players today that just don't have the breadth of service knowledge or compliance people to be able to keep up with this. We have over 200 compliance experts that follow every single thing that's happening that may happen so that we can be as agile, as Efrain mentioned earlier, on creating these products almost as soon as the issues come out.

So there's going to be some -- there's some mandates there that will have penalties that are starting to be enacted. Some are in place already in California, I think, coming up in June. So there's a lot of attraction there to people not only looking at it from that standpoint but also just from a hiring standpoint and of full benefits. There's a lot of interest, as I've mentioned, in having a full suite of benefits for the well-being of the employees that's helping retain them and attract them in a difficult market. So it's retirement, it's insurance, it's what's your work-from-home policy, your hybrid policy of working in office and home, it's all those things kind of combined. It's not just compensation. 
So that's really picked up, and we've had -- continue to have a very strong retirement sales and the fact that we offer a multitude of products, and we just went over 100,000 clients I mentioned earlier. It's a great milestone. We're still #1 in new 401(k) plans that are offered.
