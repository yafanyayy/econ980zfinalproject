Throughout our prepared remarks, we will refer to the results presentation we have shared this morning, and then we will open the line for your questions. 
Just before starting, let me please share with you a couple of novelties we have introduced this quarter. On our back excel file that we provide every quarter, you can now find a new type that summarizes all of our [indiscernible] products and what is left to do so that you can keep track of our progress and update your [indiscernible] accordingly. 
Additionally, you might have seen in our presentation that we are providing a medium-term guidance. Cellnex has significantly grown the size of the portfolio and geographical footprint, and therefore, the business inevitably has more complexity. So we have been appropriate to provide an indication of where we see the company in the medium term when all announced transactions have been integrated and a relevant portion of our belts products have been executed. 
And without Far further ado, I will now hand over to Tobias Martinez. Please, Tobias."

I will start by sharing with you the main highlights of the period. First, it's about our organic growth generation in the year, has been strong and consistent at that 5.5% in terms of new PoPs and existing sites and including our build-to-suit programs. We have significantly exceed our 2020 guidance, thank you to our organic growth and our strong control of cost and leases. Our revenues have increased 55% compared to last year. Our adjusted EBITDA, 72%; and our recurring leverage free cash flow, 75%. 
Integration is critical for the success of our growth strategy, and this why we; have developed a unique industrial model to ensure a smooth integration and to keep pace with our growth speed. As of today, we are on track operationally, and all of our integration processes are progressing in line with our expectations. 
We are also happy to announce today our second step in Poland. This agreement allows us to introduce the concept of the augmented TowerCo by expanding our presence in the value chains and managing, not only passive infrastructure, but also active infrastructure with the same tower economics. These capabilities will be very important in a 5G world and will strengthen our value proposition to our clients. With this transaction, we are now reaching 50% of our new pipeline of up to EUR 18 billion, which will be financed with up to EUR 7 billion of new equity. The process is on track and expected to be formally launched by the end of March. 
And as it has been said in the introduction we are presenting our medium-term guidance, which is underpinned by our highly visible and contracted financials. We are expecting our recurring leverage free cash flow to reach up to EUR 2.2 billion in 2025, 3.5x our current level. 
In Slide #3, let me please remind that our focus is not just about M&A, but on organic growth generation, crystallizing new commercial initiatives and an excellent management of our OpEx and leases. As such, we have identified 3 key sources of organic growth, escalators, densification and synergies and efficiencies. When it comes to escalators, around 65% of our pro forma revenues are linked to CPI, with the remaining 35% linked to fixed escalators. Our organic performance has accelerated, and we are expecting it to grow more than 5% annually in the coming years, including the contribution from up to 22,000 new sites to be deployed over the next 10 years. And finally, we have both a ground lease optimization and a multi-tenant approach that allows us to attract network synergies. We are therefore presenting our 2021/2025 plan that is targeting 20,000 sites by 2025 and is expected to generate around EUR 100 million of annual savings. 
If we move to Slide #4, José Manuel will later provide details of our 2021 guidance, but let me please comment on our medium-term guidance. We are expecting our revenues to grow 21% annually until 2025. Our adjusted EBITDA, 24%; and our recurring leverage free cash flow, 28%, reaching up to EUR 2.2 billion in 2025. This means reaching a at that levels, 3.5x larger than today, thanks to the contribution from our visible and contracted business. 
If we also add the additional pipeline of opportunities in which we are currently working, recurring leverage free cash flow per share should increase around 5x on a run rate basis When All of our deals are closed and build-to-suit programs complete. 
On the following slide, you can see the status of our current integration processes, which are performing as planned. In order to warranty sustainable growth, Cellnex has identified and defined and implemented a global governance model, which bears the following characteristics: cash clearly and formally distributed between group and countries; transversal policies and tools easily adaptable to each country-specific realities, inclusive of all companies' functions throughout our different geographies; a robust and scalable company policies, procedures and processes; easy monitoring through global dashboards, which allows for KPIs tracking; and supervisory and decision-making roles and bodies at all levels and geographies. 
In the Slide #6 and #7, let me now share some considerations regarding our ESG approach. As a company, with a clear long-term view, becomes an integral part of the corporate strategy involving all areas and country units. And as approved, 2020 has been the first year in which we have introduced a specific ESG component in the senior management's remuneration. To further emphasize its commitment, we have expanded the role of our Appointments and Remunerations Committee, which now includes sustainability to that the company, highest governance body can oversee our progress. Last year, our Board approved our new 2021/2025 ESG plan with 6 strategic lines that will be deployed through 92 specific actions, each of them linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We also create EHG Management Committee that will coordinate the activities to reach these goals involving talent management, equality, cultural diversity, inclusion policies environment actions and climate change strategy. This includes carbon footprint reduction with an energy transition plan towards green and renewable energy. Specifically, we aim to achieve 100% of our group energy consumption green certified by 2025, with a 40% threshold in 2021. 
Additional best practice such as gender diversity among nonexecutive directors or their training to properly manage ESG-related topics are also paving the way for execution of our ESG agenda. The creation of the Cellnex Foundation is another important step to increase the awareness of our social impact. It implemented projects to bridge the digital divide, encourage the entrepreneurial talent or promoting stem vocations. 
The following slide shows how some of the main international sustainability indexes measure our ESG performance and our commitment to continuous improvement. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, José Manuel Aisa, who will provide more details of the period."
275401287,706031279,2226929,"Cellnex Telecom, S.A., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2021",2021-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Cellnex Telecom, S.A.","Executives","Thank you, Tobias. Let me please start highlighting that we have exceeded over the metrics of our 2020 financial outlook.

Let me please start highlighting that we have exceeded over the metrics of our 2020 financial outlook. Adjusted EBITDA above the range provided last year, cash items below adjusted EBITDA performing in line and our recurring levered free cash flow and our organic growth, growing faster than our initial expectation. 
Moving to the next slide and providing a few more details. Revenues have increased 55% to EUR 1.6 billion. Our recurring leverage free cash flow has increased 75% to EUR 610 million. Our total PoPs have increased around 60%, including the contribution from organic growth and our recent acquisitions. And if we focus on organic growth only, excluding any change of perimeter, PoPs have increased around  5.5% compared to last year, as a result of the continued network densification we are seeing across Europe. 
Moving now to our main financial metrics. Let me please emphasize our solid margin expansion and the fact that our recurring leverage free cash flow is growing faster than our revenues, which is explained by our operating leverage of our business. Also, in this slide, you will find that the maintenance CapEx has been stable at 3%; our interest paid, 1.5%; and our cap tax is just 2.4% of our total revenues. The company on a like-for-like basis and regarding OpEx is performing flat. 
So if we go to Slide #12. Here, we explain our recurring leverage free cash flow generation. You can see that the positive impact from our organic growth, including efficiencies and the gradual deployment of our build-to-suit sites is significantly reinforced by the contribution from our recent deals. This is partially offset by cash elements below adjusted EBITDA being the payment of leases associated with new portfolio the main contributor. Taking all these effects together, Cellnex has generated a strong recurring leverage free cash flow growth of 75% year-on-year. Please note that 17% of this growth is coming from just pure organic. 
Moving to Slide 13. Here, we can see the balance sheet and the movements compared to December last year that are mainly explained by our M&A activity in the period, increase in total assets as a result of our M&A activity and the corresponding decrease in cash, more than offset by our 2020 capital increase and debt issuance during the year. As you can see, the company has a prudent PPA policy that leads to fixed access allocation primarily with only marginal impact on goodwill. 
And just a few words on our capital structure and our current liquidity position. We have more than EUR 17 billion in available liquidity, including EUR 11 billion undrawn credit lines, a strong backlog of contracted revenues at EUR 110 billion, an average debt maturity of 7 years with a highly competitive cost of 1.5%. The vast majority of our debt is fixed, around 85%, and our corporate debt give us total financial flexibility. We have no hedge, no pledge, no guarantee, no covenant. This unique combination allow us to maintain our financial flexibility in this challenging environment and provide us with a wide rate of options to continue financing our growth at a very low cost of debt. 
And very quickly on our 2021 financial outlook. We are expecting our adjusted EBITDA to grow at around of 55%, with our recurring leverage free cash flow growing at around 50% and our organic growth above 5%, including contribution from also our BTS program. 
Finally, just few words on our last transaction in Poland. Moving now to Slide 18. Here, you can see that we have reached an agreement for an acquisition of 7,000 sites in the country and a BTS program of up to 1,500 sites. As we have said earlier, this transaction allows us to enhance our industrial profile and move from a pure real estate company to a global infrastructure partner by expanding our presence in the value chain and building 5G capabilities to be shared with different clients. This can only be done by a neutral player with a strong track record providing end-to-end services under strict operational KPIs, and we believe that this expertise will be critical to crystallize further shared service in the cost text of 5G. Including the associated expansion CapEx, we expect to dedicate approximately EUR 2.2 billion towards this deal in a change for a portfolio that is expected to generate an adjusted EBITDA of around EUR 350 million on a run rate basis. So a compelling valuation in our view. And with double economics in terms of the same cash generation profile, inflation linked, long-term contracts and cotenant, neutral-host model, and for sure, the same expected returns. 
And with this, let's please open the line for your questions."

We've obviously seen the share under pressure in the last month, and there's obviously lots of moving parts, but I'm just wondering if you had any updated thinking on the size of the rights issue, given what we've seen? 
And then secondly, on the augmented TowerCo, I think this is a fascinating development, something I think you highlighted was a potential move at your CMDA number of years ago. How easy do you think this is to replicate this model in Poland into other markets across Europe? And how big an opportunity do you think this could be?"

We are opening a very strong industrial differentiation of fullness compared to any other player. So therefore, we are still thinking what we thought at the moment that we presented the last time to you.

It's really partnering with our customers, taking care and managing this run agreement, this radio access network, we do believe, Simon, that today, it's a tipping point in the transformation of this industry. And we will see more and more projects like that in Europe. I cannot tell you where and when. But we do expect that this is an opportunity for sure, first of all, for our customers because they are doing among them. But this is also a great opportunity for us, being the long-term partner for end-to-end solutions.

Firstly, just on the rights issue and your M&A comments from earlier in the call, I guess it's a big picture question. I'm just trying to understand a month or so ago, when you announced the rights issue, it was a EUR 7 billion rights issue to fund EUR 18 billion of M&A. As you said on the call today already, you've effectively committed half that pipeline before the rights issue is done. So clearly, your execution on deal pipeline has been extremely rapid. I guess I'm just trying to see how we should think about going forward, obviously, the challenges digestion of these sorts of rights issues? So how do you think about as that pipeline evolves? Is the pace at which you're doing it, future funding needs and future pipeline? So just if you could just give us some color on how you think about how you manage those various things. 
The second question is on your guidance, on your midterm guidance, obviously, very helpful, you've given us some color now on where you think 2025 numbers should be. I guess I just wanted to clarify what is incorporated in that guidance. So obviously, you've rolled up all of the transactions you've announced. But can you talk us through what else is or isn't included? And I guess, specifically, I'm quite keen to understand if synergies are in them or not? And if they're not, at least, if you're not ready as yet to give any numbers to that, if you could just give us some color on that. 
And then the final thing was just a very quick clarification on Poland. If we look at the multiple, it's actually lower than what you paid for the Elia transaction. Now I appreciate you've often said not to look just at headline multiples. But just if I can understand that process and just the reason for the question is that, as I'm sure you get -- we get a lot of questions around the competitive nature of M&A today and the view that potentially there is more bidding intensity but yet the multiple here is low. So just interest and how those negotiations went? And how we should we think about that?"

Second one is, are there any conversations you're having with edition about their holding? I gather they didn't back the last rights issue. Do you know what they're planning to do this time. 
And finally, dividends to minorities were quite light. How much do you expect those to ramp-up in 2021, 2022 as you have those minorities in France, Switzerland, Poland? 
And then the final question is, the price per power in this Polish deal that Akhil was pointing out is quite cheap. And just to be clear, that includes the radios that you're buying in the transaction as well?"

Basically this company manages not only passing first upper, but also the run equipment. So both the passive and the access side is included in the perimeter of the project. Third question, dividends to minorities, not much. Bear in mind that we do have some minority partners in some of our portfolios, but also, at the same time, we have quite significant buildout commitments. So the cash generated by those projects will be used, as José Manuel was saying before. This organic generation will be used to fund the build so commitments. So we are not expecting dividend payments to minorities. 
Okay. On the first question, inflation in 2021, we are not actually including almost anything. Based on the, I would say, the macro environment in 2020, we are not including almost actually 0 inflation, a contribution in our 2021 guidance.

Then in relation to your question of Polkomtel being as exposed to Huawei. As of today, this is none. So there is no immediate impact in relation to that element, if that will be your question. 
There is a FAQ at the end of the presentation, and what we try to explain there is that the technological decision, vendor decisions are led by the anchor logically, and we follow and we put on the table our thinking around that. But it is always the vendor decision taken by the first anchor who is taking that opportunity. And on those countries where there are already rent sharing going on, the normal way that MNOs split the responsibilities is by geographical areas, each 1 takes their responsibility. So the model that we are intending to test with this first transaction could be perfectly applicable to all those already rent sharing agreements which are around place. So when you try to envisage how far we could go on that, do not think that because there is already a run sharing agreement, there is no possibility for this augmented TowerCo to have a role.

First one, it's a follow-up from actual last call. You talked about the ability to extract synergies from all the deals you have been announcing over the last 12 months, and one of this is actually to combine the PTS, the legacy. And a lot depend on the nature of the contracts you have I think remember it was Tobias mentioned that synergies are much easier to extract when you got MSA. So we're just wondering, given the portfolio you have, you give a lot of breakdown in terms of inflation, a much linked to inflation, I mentioned not to escalators, could you just give a bit of a breakdown how much of the revenues you have actual linked to MSA or much of the acquisition you have done over the last 24 months, and therefore, it's easier to express synergies to combine portfolio and how much would be probably so easy? 
The second one is basically a follow-up on guidance. You state that there is not any sort of expectation inflation for the '21 guidance, but also you provide mid-term guidance of 25%. So I was just wondering if there is any expectation or any of the guidance you provide, does it reflect any expectation for inflation over that period? And because there's a lot of material, I didn't really see if you also have an assumption of ForEx, considering how you have significant exposure to Polish zloty, the Swiss franc and the pound. Because that is exactly something that should be taken account, particularly for the Polish zloty. 
And the third is -- that's [indiscernible] from a comment from a CEO of Orange recently. If there's something missing, anytime you announce the deal, is that most of you do it and never really with a very few exceptions, agree with an incumbent, or at least with the #2 like Vodafone. So I was just wondering what is the resistance? Stéphane Richard, CEO of Orange, really mentioned you by name as a sort of hoping that none of the other incumbents sell tower to you. So I was just wondering what's the resistance they have. It's the fact that you never agree an initial term that is lower than 15, 20 years. It's any other terms of the contracts that they found difficult to digest? The prices? And what will be really interested to hear how negotiation goes whenever you talk to them vis-à-vis all the deals you complete with the other operators?"

I mean, for example, with Hutchinson, Hutchison deal encompassing [ 600 ], that is an MSA, with win in Italy with [indiscernible]; in France, those are MSAs. To finish with you this one in Poland as well, of course, that is also an MSA. So I would say that that the majority of them, we don't have the figure. 
So let me -- let us come back to you on that, but I would say that the majority of our revenues are coming from contracts that are MSA compared to MLAs. 
But also bear in mind, Ottavio, maybe a clarification that an MLA does not make a synergy impossible. I mean, obviously, I mean, it is true that, this possibility is embedded in the contract, if it's an but obviously, under an MLA, if we can find an interesting angle for both parties, that can also be done great. So it's not a hurdle. It is not impossible. In terms of inflation assumption until 2025, we are, I would say, assuming like 1% roughly on our inflation-linked contracts. And then on top of that, obviously, the contribution from fixed escalators that we also have in our contracts. 
ForEx, we are projecting the current situation, okay? Any deviation compared to our view, we will provide that, but we are assuming something very simple something constant.

I mean it's the same with other, let me say, independent tower costs. 
So I think this is the big question mark, and then when you are not in a position to sell down majority. So you are taking one road, and we are in the other road. We are not able to maximize returns, efficiencies, growth, being a minority shareholder. It's not possible. And we do believe to be clear on this value proposition since the very beginning. But it doesn't mean that we are not in a position to cooperate in a country-by-country basis in order to extrapolate, to maximize the operational synergies or efficiencies. 
So I mean, in fact, we are delivering services to Orange in Spain and in France. But -- well, if some telecom operators understand that for them, it's much better to keep the control of those assets full respect but we do believe that this is not the best way to obtain or to extract the maximum value of this opportunity. But again, maybe it's a process. Maybe in 2 or 3 or 4 years from now, the situation maybe could be different. I don't know. 
But again, I think the quick question is not about a company related. It's about, if you want to give the control of the assets to a third party or not. And I think this is the big question mark."

The first question is just looking a little bit deeper into your lease saving programs. Obviously, leases are going to be a very big cost in your previous presentation, you mentioned that Galata leases were down by 20% over 6 years. Can you maybe say how you did that, whether it was buying freehold land or it's paying upfront on a multiyear basis? And can you maybe just say like what the efficiency ratio is here? As I noticed in the presentation, you said no incremental Capex. So how should we think about that expansion CapEx number going forward? Is a lot of that going to be dedicated towards lease efficiency and what else is that CapEx spent on? 
And just the second question is Tobias, just in the past, you've always emphasized how you prefer to expand in existing markets. Is that still the case? Just the reason I ask is just looking at Alex's presentation that you gave last week for Tower Exchange, there was quite a few kind of new markets in there, whether it was the Baltics or Central Europe. So any kind of flavor you could give us on where the future expansion is? And maybe say a few words, if you could, about the pipeline with Deutsche Telekom potentially."

On the leases, I would say that the -- we're talking about the specific Galata case. It is that we have done some acquisition of land. And also, this is something that we are contemplating more and more today. But historically, not a lot",748,"Thank you, Emmet. On the leases, I would say that the -- we're talking about the specific Galata case. It is that we have done some acquisition of land. And also, this is something that we are contemplating more and more today. But historically, not a lot. I would say that the most efficient tools that we have been using is a straight renegotiation. Bear in mind also the state under which we inherit these contracts. I mean we don't only acquire assets. We don't only create a contract with a on core tenant. But in many cases, we also inherit a gray space that is coming from the mobile operator. So it is after the transaction that we have the opportunity to optimize that ground lease space. So in many cases, it has been a straight renegotiation, approaching the landlord and get better terms. And also in some cases, something that we've seen is very powerful is the concept of the cash advance. So we pay upfront a number of years. In exchange of a sands or maybe a longer right-of-use beyond the initial investment with a similar return, similar average saving, but it is to that -- in that case, we needed to present some cash upfront for the new towers that we are now including in this new perimeter, I would say that the strategy will be exact. Also, we will be targeting very similar savings. That will very much depend on the specific dynamics of the market, maybe 4 years ago, we were mostly based in Spain and Italy. Now we have now a multi-country operation, so we will also find different realities. But the target is quite consistent with what we have been achieving in the past. When we see incremental Capex, it is -- we refer to non incremental CapEx beyond we are already estimating in terms of expansion CapEx okay. So basically, that the area here is that we are not giving the idea that we require more CapEx beyond what we are already expecting, okay? So this 8%, 9% on total revenues as passed on Capex, that should be more bad enough to achieve these expected savings. Well, your question about the existing markets, well, I think it's very important to reach certain degree of market share in every country. I mean, Europe is not a single market. It's not a single market, means that we have to reach a certain degree of market share in the 12 countries where we are today, 12 countries. So this is the reason why for us, it's so important to reach certain level of assets because it's when we are in a position to extrapolate, to maximize the efficiencies and synergies as well. The second important thing is the company is also devoted to develop customer relationship beyond of a just pure monetization of the existing passive infrastructure. And I think today, we are presenting to you the project in Poland, which is completely different. But again, for us, we do believe we have a lot of room for improvement to develop our portfolio of services with the existing customers in the third quanties where we are today. We we're keeping the same strategy of maintaining our priorities in Europe and the existing countries where we are today. Obviously, you met, that we would be happy to find the right opportunities in new countries like Germany. But if not, well, we have a lot of opportunities in front of us. We are running almost a 125,000 sites in the 12 countries where we are today. We have the opportunities maybe to replicate this opportunity we are presenting today in Poland, in other countries where we are running to Oncore tenants. So I think the landscape or the pipeline of opportunities in front of us is huge and extremely, extremely attractive in terms of financial rationales. And therefore, we are not, let me say, obsess it in order to enter in Germany or in other new countries. So obviously, we will like to be there. But we want to be there, it makes sense for us. If not, we will try to do it. But again, I think in the main principles of our strategy about geographies and services. We remain in the same position with very clear and very simple priority. It's current countries and to maximize our customer relationship. For us, it's very important to develop our customer relationship in every country."

Or whether at some point you think distributing the dividends to your shareholders can become an important pillar in your equity story? 
The second question is about -- yes, just following up on the comments you made on Ottavio's question about the approach from incumbents. And I was wondering whether a solution where you would have joint control with one of the incumbents, could be a way to convince them that it's more acceptable to your business with you? I'm conscious that the joint control comes without consolidation often. So that's probably an obstacle for you.

And as it has been said in the introduction we are presenting our medium-term guidance, which is underpinned by our highly visible and contracted financials. We are expecting our recurring leveraged free cash flow to reach up to EUR 2.2 billion in 2025, 3.5x our current level.  
In Slide #3, let me please remind that our focus is not just about M&A, but on organic growth generation, crystallizing new commercial initiatives and an excellent management of our OpEx and leases. As such, we have identified 3 key sources of organic growth: escalators, densification and synergies and efficiencies. When it comes to escalators, around 65% of our pro forma revenues are linked to CPI, with the remaining 35% linked to fixed escalators. Our organic performance has accelerated, and we are expecting it to grow more than 5% annually in the coming years, including the contribution from up to 22,000 new sites to be deployed over the next 10 years. And finally, we have both a ground lease optimization and a multi-tenant approach that allows us to attract network synergies. We are therefore presenting our 2021-2025 plan that is targeting 20,000 sites by 2025 and is expected to generate around EUR 100 million of annual savings.  
If we move to Slide #4, José Manuel will later provide details of our 2021 guidance, but let me please comment on our medium-term guidance. We are expecting our revenues to grow 21% annually until 2025. Our adjusted EBITDA, 24%; and our recurring leveraged free cash flow, 28%, reaching up to EUR 2.2 billion in 2025. This means reaching at that levels, 3.5x larger than today, thanks to the contribution from our visible and contracted business.  
If we also add the additional pipeline of opportunities in which we are currently working, recurring leveraged free cash flow per share should increase around 5x on a run rate basis when all of our deals are closed and build-to-suit programs complete.  
On the following slide, you can see the status of our current integration processes, which are performing as planned. In order to warrant a sustainable growth, Cellnex has identified and defined and implemented a global governance model, which bears the following characteristics: cash clearly and formally distributed between group and countries, transversal policies and tools easily adaptable to each country-specific realities, inclusive of all companies' functions throughout our different geographies, a robust and scalable company policies, procedures and processes; easy monitoring through global dashboards, which allows for KPIs tracking; and supervisory and decision-making roles and bodies at all levels and geographies.  
In Slides #6 and #7, let me now share some considerations regarding our ESG approach. As a company with a clear long-term view, ESG becomes an integral part of the corporate strategy involving all areas and country units. And as approved, 2020 has been the first year in which we have introduced a specific ESG component in the senior management's remuneration.  
To further emphasize its commitment, we have expanded the role of our Appointments and Remunerations Committee, which now includes sustainability to that the company's highest governance body can oversee our progress. Last year, our Board approved our new 2021-2025 ESG plan with 6 strategic lines that will be deployed through 92 specific actions, each of them linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We also create ESG Management Committee that will coordinate the activities to reach these goals involving talent management, equality, cultural diversity, inclusion policies, environmental actions and climate change strategy. This includes carbon footprint reduction with an energy transition plan towards green and renewable energy. Specifically, we aim to achieve 100% of our group energy consumption green certified by 2025, with a 40% threshold in 2021.  
Additional best practice such as gender diversity among nonexecutive directors or their training to properly manage ESG-related topics are also paving the way for execution of our ESG agenda. The creation of The Cellnex Foundation is another important step to increase the awareness of our social impact. It implemented projects to bridge the digital divide, encourage the entrepreneurial talent or promoting stem vocations.  
The following slide shows how some of the main international sustainability indexes measure our ESG performance and our commitment to continuous improvement. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, José Manuel Aisa, who will provide more details of the period."

Let me please start highlighting that we have exceeded over the metrics of our 2020 financial outlook. Adjusted EBITDA above the range provided last year, cash items below adjusted EBITDA, performing in line, and our recurring leveraged",785,"Thank you, Tobias. Let me please start highlighting that we have exceeded over the metrics of our 2020 financial outlook. Adjusted EBITDA above the range provided last year, cash items below adjusted EBITDA, performing in line, and our recurring leveraged free cash flow and our organic growth, growing faster than our initial expectation.  
Moving to the next slide and providing a few more details. Revenues have increased 55% to EUR 1.6 billion. Our recurring leveraged free cash flow has increased 75% to EUR 610 million. Our total PoPs have increased around 60%, including the contribution from organic growth and our recent acquisitions. And if we focus on organic growth only, excluding any change of perimeter, PoPs have increased around 5.5% compared to last year, as a result of the continued network densification we are seeing across Europe.  
Moving now to our main financial metrics. Let me please emphasize our solid margin expansion and the fact that our recurring leveraged free cash flow is growing faster than our revenues, which is explained by our operating leverage of our business. Also in this slide, you will find that the maintenance CapEx has been stable at 3%; our interest paid, 1.5%; and our cash tax is just 2.4% of our total revenues. The company on a like-for-like basis and regarding OpEx is performing flat.  
So if we go to Slide #12, here, we explain our recurring leveraged free cash flow generation. You can see that the positive impact from our organic growth, including efficiencies and the gradual deployment of our build-to-suit sites is significantly reinforced by the contribution from our recent deals. This is partially offset by cash elements below adjusted EBITDA, being the payment of leases associated with new portfolio as the main contributor.  
Taking all these effects together, Cellnex has generated a strong recurring leveraged free cash flow growth of 75% year-on-year. Please note that 17% of this growth is coming from just pure organic.  
Moving to Slide 13. Here, we can see the balance sheet and the movements compared to December last year that are mainly explained by our M&A activity in the period. Increase in total assets as a result of our M&A activity and the corresponding decrease in cash, more than offset by our 2020 capital increase and debt issuance during the year. As you can see, the company has a prudent PPA policy that leads to fixed assets allocation primarily with only marginal impact on goodwill.  
And just a few words on our capital structure and our current liquidity position. We have more than EUR 17 billion in available liquidity, including EUR 11 billion undrawn credit lines, a strong backlog of contracted revenues at EUR 110 billion, an average debt maturity of 7 years with a highly competitive cost of 1.5%. The vast majority of our debt is fixed, around 85%, and our corporate debt give us total financial flexibility. We have no hedge, no pledge, no guarantee, no covenant. This unique combination allow us to maintain our financial flexibility in this challenging environment and provide us with a wider range of options to continue financing our growth at a very low cost of debt 
And very quickly on our 2021 financial outlook. We are expecting our adjusted EBITDA to grow at around of 55%, with our recurring leveraged free cash flow growing at around 50% and our organic growth above 5%, including contribution from also our BTS programs.  
Finally, just few words on our last transaction in Poland. Moving now to Slide 18. Here, you can see that we have reached an agreement for an acquisition of 7,000 sites in the country and a BTS program of up to 1,500 sites. As we have said earlier, this transaction allows us to enhance our industrial profile and move from a pure real estate company to a global infrastructure partner by expanding our presence in the value chain and building 5G capabilities to be shared with different clients. This can only be done by a neutral player with a strong track record providing end-to-end services under strict operational KPIs. And we believe that this expertise will be critical to crystallize further shared service in the context of 5G. Including the associated expansion CapEx, we expect to dedicate approximately EUR 2.2 billion towards this deal in a change for a portfolio that is expected to generate an adjusted EBITDA of around EUR 350 million on a run rate basis. So a compelling valuation in our view. And with double economics in terms of the same cash generation profile, inflation linked, long-term contracts, anchor tenant, neutral host model, for sure, the same expected returns.  
And with this, let's please open the line for your questions."

And then secondly, on the augmented TowerCo, I think this is a fascinating development. Something I think you highlighted was a potential move at your CMDA number of year ago. How easy do you think this is to replicate this model in Poland into other markets across Europe? And how big an opportunity do you think this could be?"

We are opening a very strong industrial differentiation of Cellnex compared to any other player. So therefore, we are still thinking what we thought at the moment that we presented the last time to you.

It's really partnering with our customers, taking care and managing this RAN agreement, this radio access network, we do believe, Simon, that today, it's a tipping point in the transformation of this industry. And we will see more and more projects like that in Europe. I cannot tell you where and when, but we do expect that this is an opportunity for sure, first of all, for our customers because they are doing among them. But this is also a great opportunity for us, being the long-term partner for end-to-end solutions.

Firstly, just on the rights issue and your M&A comments from earlier in the call, I guess it's a big picture question. I'm just trying to understand, a month or so ago, when you announced the rights issue, it was a EUR 7 billion rights issue to fund EUR 18 billion of M&A. As you said on the call today already, you've effectively committed half that pipeline before the rights issue is done. So clearly, your execution on deal pipeline has been extremely rapid. I guess I'm just trying to see how we should think about going forward, obviously, the challenges digestion of these sorts of rights issues? So how do you think about as that pipeline evolves? Is the pace at which you're doing it, future funding needs and future pipeline? So just if you could just give us some color on how you think about how you manage those various things.  
The second question is on your guidance, on your midterm guidance, obviously, very helpful, you've given us some color now on where you think 2025 numbers should be. I guess I just wanted to clarify what is incorporated in that guidance. So obviously, you've rolled up all of the transactions you've announced. But can you talk us through what else is or isn't included? And I guess, specifically, I'm quite keen to understand if synergies are in them or not. And if they're not, at least, if you're not ready as yet to give any numbers to that, if you could just give us some color around that.  
And then the final thing was just a very quick clarification on Poland. If we look at the multiple, it's actually lower than what you paid for the Iliad transaction. Now I appreciate you've often said not to look just at headline multiples. But just if I can understand that process and just the reason for the question is that, as I'm sure you get, we get a lot of questions around the competitive nature of M&A today and the view that potentially there is more bidding intensity but yet the multiple here is low. So just interested in how those negotiations went and how we should we think about that."

Then in relation to your question of Polkomtel being as exposed to Huawei. As of today, this is none. So there is no immediate impact in relation to that element, if that will be your question. 
There is a FAQ at the end of the presentation, and what we try to explain there is that the technological decision, vendor decisions are led by the anchor logically, and we follow and we put on the table our thinking around that. But it is always the vendor decision taken by the first anchor, who is taking that opportunity. And on those countries where there are already RAN sharing going on, the normal way that MNOs split the responsibilities is by geographical areas, if one takes their responsibility. So the model that we are intending to test with this first transaction could be perfectly applicable to all those already RAN sharing agreements which are on place. So when you try to envisage how far we could go on that, do not think that because there is already a RAN sharing agreement, there is no possibility for this augmented TowerCo to have a role.

First one, it's a follow-up from actually the last call. You talked about the ability to extract synergies from all the deals you have been announcing over the last 12 months, and one of this is actually to combine the BTS and the legacy. And a lot depends on the nature of the contracts you have. I think I remember it was Tobias who mentioned that synergies are much easier to extract when you got MSA. So we're just wondering, given the portfolio you have, you give a lot of breakdown in terms of inflation, much linked to inflation, much are not to escalators. Could you just give a bit of a breakdown how much of the revenues you have are actually linked to MSA or much of the acquisition you have done over the last 12, 24 months, and therefore, it's easier to extract synergies to combine portfolio and how much would be probably so easy? 
The second one is basically a follow-up on guidance. You state that there is not any sort of expectation in inflation for the '21 guidance, but also you provide midterm guidance on '25. So I was just wondering if there is any expectation or any of the guidance you provide, does it reflect any expectation for inflation over that period? And because there's a lot of material, I didn't really see if you also had an assumption of ForEx, considering how you have significant exposure to Polish zloty, the Swiss franc and the pound. Because that is exactly something that should be taken into account, particularly for the Polish zloty. 
And the third is -- that's [indiscernible] from a comment from a CEO of Orange recently. If there's something missing anytime you announce the deal, if you start mostly with a deal, never really with a very few exceptions, agree with an incumbent, or at least with a #2 like Vodafone. So I was just wondering, what is the resistance? Pretty surprised the CEO of Orange really mentioned you by name as a sort of hoping that none of the other incumbents sell tower to you. So I was just wondering, what's the resistance they have? It's the fact that you never agree an initial term that is lower than 15, 20 years? It's any other terms of the contracts that they found difficult to digest? The prices? I would be really interested to hear how negotiation goes whenever you talk to them vis-à-vis all the deals you complete with the other operators."

I would say that the vast majority of our largest contracts are actually MSA. I mean, for example, with Hutchinson, Hutchison deal encompassing 6 countries, that is an MSA, with win in Italy with Bouygues Telecom; in France, those are MSAs. To finish with you this one in Poland as well, of course, that is also an MSA. So I would say that the majority of them, we don't have the figure. 
So let me -- let us come back to you on that, but I would say that the majority of our revenues are coming from contracts that are MSA compared to MLAs. 
So bear in mind, Ottavio, maybe a clarification that an MLA does not make a synergy impossible. I mean, obviously -- I mean, it is true that this possibility is embedded in the contract if it's an MSA. But obviously, under an MLA, if we can find an interesting angle for both parties, that can also be done, okay? So it's not a hurdle. It is not impossible. In terms of inflation assumption until 2025, we are, I would say, assuming like 1% roughly on our inflation-linked contracts. And then on top of that, obviously, the contribution from fixed escalators that we also have in our contracts. 
ForEx, we are projecting the current situation, okay? Any deviation compared to our view, we will provide that, but we are assuming something very simple something constant.

When you are looking for a minority monetization, it's a different story. It's a different project. It's -- in fact, we do believe that we are not competing with controlled tower cost companies by telecom operators. We are not competing in the organic growth, maybe we are competing in some local countries in some local markets. But this is not a company-related matter. I mean it's the same with other, let me say, independent tower costs. 
So I think this is the big question mark, and then when you are not in a position to sell down majority. So you are taking one road and we are in the other road. We are not able to maximize returns, efficiencies, growth, being a minority shareholder. It's not possible. And we do believe to be clear on this value proposition since the very beginning. But it doesn't mean that we are not in a position to cooperate in a country-by-country basis in order to extrapolate, to maximize the operational synergies or efficiencies. 
So I mean, in fact, we are delivering services to Orange in Spain and in France. But -- well, if some telecom operators understand that for them, it's much better to keep the control of those assets, full respect, but we do believe that this is not the best way to obtain or to extract the maximum value of this opportunity. But again, maybe it's a process. Maybe in 2 or 3 or 4 years from now, the situation maybe could be different. I don't know. 
But again, I think the quick question is not about a company related. It's about if you want to give the control of the assets to a third party or not. And I think this is the big question mark."

And just the second question is, Tobias, just in the past, you've always emphasized how you prefer to expand in existing markets. Is that still the case?

On the leases, I would say that the -- we're talking about the specific Galata case. It is that we have done some acquisition of land. And also, this is something that we are contemplating more and more today. But historically, not a lot. I would say that the most efficient tools that we have been using is a straight renegotiation. Bear in mind also the estate under which we inherit these contracts. I mean we don't only acquire assets. We don't only create a contract with an anchor tenant. But in many cases, we also inherit a lot of space that is coming from the mobile operators. So it is after the transaction that we have the opportunity to optimize that ground lease space. So in many cases, it has been a straight renegotiation, approaching the landlord and get better terms. And also, in some cases, something that we've seen is very powerful is the concept of the cash advance. So we pay upfront a number of years in exchange of some years or maybe a longer right-of-use beyond the initial investment with a similar return, similar average saving, but it is to that -- in that case, we needed to present some cash upfront. 
For the new towers that we are now including in this new perimeter, I would say that the strategy will be exactly the same. Also, we will be targeting very similar savings. That will very much depend on the specific dynamics of the market. Maybe 4 years ago, we were mostly based in Spain and Italy. Now we have now a multi-country operation, so we will also find different realities. But the target is quite consistent with what we have been achieving in the past. When we say incremental CapEx, it is -- we refer to non-incremental CapEx beyond we are already estimating in terms of expansion CapEx, okay? So basically, that the idea here is that we are not giving the idea that we'd require more CapEx beyond what we are already expecting, okay? So this 8%, 9% on total revenues as expansion CapEx, that should be more than enough to achieve these expected savings."

I mean, Europe is not a single market. It's not a single market, means that we have to reach certain degree of market share in the 12 countries where we are today, 12 countries. So this is the reason why, for us, it's so important to reach certain level of assets because it's when we are in a position to extrapolate, to maximize the efficiencies and synergies as well. 
The second important thing is the company is also devoted to develop customer relationship beyond of a just pure monetization of the existing passive infrastructure. And I think today, we are presenting to you the project in Poland, which is completely different. But again, for us, we do believe we have a lot of room for improvement to develop our portfolio of services with the existing customers in the 12 countries where we are today. We're keeping the same strategy of maintaining our priorities in Europe and the existing countries where we are today. Obviously, Emmet, that we would be happy to find the right opportunities in new countries like Germany. But if not, well, we have a lot of opportunities in front of us. We are running almost  125,000 sites in the 12 countries where we are today. We have the opportunities maybe to replicate this opportunity we are presenting today in Poland, in other countries where we are running to anchor tenants. So I think the landscape or the pipeline of opportunities in front of us is huge and extremely, extremely attractive in terms of financial rationales. And therefore, we are not, let me say, obsessed in order to enter in Germany or in other new countries. So obviously, we will like to be there. But we want to be there, if it makes sense for us. If not, we will try to do it. But again, I think in the main principles of our strategy about geographies and services. We remain in the same position with very clear and very simple priority. It's current countries and to maximize our customer relationship. For us, it's very important to develop our customer relationship in every country."

The second question is about -- yes, just following up on the comments you made on Ottavio's question about the approach from incumbents. And I was wondering whether a solution where you would have joint control with one of the incumbents, could be a way to convince them that it's more acceptable to make business with you? I'm conscious that joint control comes without consolidation often. So that's probably an obstacle for you.

However, on the legacy against legacy, even though a build to suit is done, always, this will remain. So it is not something that we believe is having a hard time in 2025.

I do have -- we have built up industrial tax angle. We are a neutral company. As a neutral company, we have the flexibility to develop research and development, industrial, patent box. We have also BTS programs that allow us to gain full tax deductible of the -- of a portion of the consideration to be paid to the seller. You know that we foster asset deals in front of share deals. So it's somehow several initiatives, all of them fully compliant with European standards law, fully compliant with the good tax practices that allow us to reduce this cash tax. So it's not a result of, let's say, casualty. It's a result of a thorough assessment country-by-country and following a very clear M&A criteria and also funding.

Thank you so much for your time today, and thank you for sharing with us our birthday because we are celebrating today 6 years since our IPO. 
Let me please start by sharing with you the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation in the period continues to be strong and consistent with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit program, generating a 5.5% growth. We are also making tangible progress on our new efficiencies plan, in a way consistent with the lease optimization initiatives we have been implementing in the past. 
5G is becoming a reality, and we are identifying new opportunities arising from the need for a better connectivity where a neutral operator like Cellnex can play a key, such as transfer network systems. The period also provides a strong financial performance, with revenues increasing 40% compared to the last year. Our adjusted EBITDA, 45%; and our recurring leverage free cash flow, 40%, with our backlog reaching EUR 110 billion when all our deals are closed. 
Just a few words on our right issue that we have recently concluded. It's been one of the largest offering in Europe and also globally in the last years, and 99.5% of rights holders have subscribed. So thank you very much. Thank you so much to our investors for your continued support and trust in this team. 
We are actively working on our $9 billion pipeline of opportunities, which we are expecting to execute in the coming 18 months. And we are assessing these opportunities, maintaining our strict financial discipline. In terms of capital structure going forward, we are keeping all doors open, assessing a wide array of available options to continue financing our growth including equity partners at local level. 
And finally, we are reiterating our guidance with all fronts on track: organic growth generation, all financial metrics in line with our short- and medium-term outlook. Integration is a critical part of our growth strategy, and we can confirm that all our integration processes are on track, and we are also making progress on our new ESG master plan. 
If we move to Slide #3, we are showing here for illustrative purposes the expected profile of both adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leverage free cash flow during the remaining quarters of 2021. As you can see, these magnitudes will increase every quarter as we generate organic growth, make progress on our build-to-suit program and efficiency plan and see the contribution from new deals when they are closed. As a reminder, we are expecting our adjusted EBITDA to grow at around 55% and our recurring leverage free cash flow to grow at around 50% in 2021. 
On the following slide, you can see the status of our current integration processes, which are performing as planned. In order to guarantee a sustainable long-term growth, Cellnex has identified -- has defined and implemented a global governance model with the following characteristics: responsibilities clearly distributed between group and countries; transversal policies, which can be adapted to the realities of each country. The model includes all company functions across our different markets: scalable company policies and procedures; easy monitoring using global dashboards, which allow a the tracking of KPIs; and supervisory and decision-making roles at all levels. 
If we go to Slide #5, just a quick review of our current footprint and financial metrics. When all our deals are closed and our build-to-suit programs complete, Cellnex will further strengthen its position in Europe as the main independent telecom infrastructure operator, managing a portfolio of around 130,000 sites with presence in 12 markets, boosting our financial and becoming the industrial partner of choice for our clients. Just a quick reminder of our medium-term guidance that implies an annual growth of more than 20% in our key financial metrics from 2020 and a very well diversified expected EBITDA in 2025 of between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion. 
On Slide #6, we are showing our updated shareholding structure after our capital increase, and we can only be grateful, again, for the continued support from investors and for sharing the long-term view of this management team. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, Jose Manuel Aisa, who will provide you a few more details."

And if we focus on organic growth only, that is excluding any change of perimeter, PoPs have increased around 5.5% compared to last year as a result of the continued network densification process we are seeing across Europe and in line with our medium-term guidance. 
Moving now to our main metrics in Slide #9. On top of the figures, just discussed, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 45% compared to last year, and our margin has increased to 76% from 74%. If we look at the figures in the table, you can see that this adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly explained by the contribution from telecom infrastructure services, organic growth, build-to-suit and recent acquisitions and by the efficient management of our cost base. Payment of leases have increased due to a larger site portfolio. Maintenance CapEx is expected to convert towards our guidance during the year, and interest base reflects the terms of our debt structure and our available liquidity. 
On the following slide, #10, which explains our recurring level free cash flow generation, you can see the contribution to organic growth from our different drivers: colocation and associated services, build-to-suit, escalators and efficiencies. These elements combined generate EUR 24 million in the period, a 20% growth compared to Q1 last year in the period. And if we also take the additional contribution from our recent deals and the rest of cash elements below adjusted EBITDA, Cellnex has generated a strong recurring level free cash flow growth of 42% compared to last year. 
Moving to Slide 11. You can see our progress on our new efficiency plan. Please note that site management has always play a key role in our operations, and we have been extremely successfully extracting efficiencies out of our portfolio in the past, but we just want to provide additional visibility in our new plant so you can track our progress. We have renegotiated more than 700 ground lease contracts in the period, generated EUR 4 million of annualized efficiencies, and we are on track to meet our efficiencies and synergies target in 2025. 
Moving to our balance sheet. Movements compared to December last year are mainly explained by our M&A activity in the period. Increase in total assets is a result of our M&A activity and the corresponding increased liability as a result of the issuance of debt in this period. Please note that this picture does not include the proceeds of our recent capital increase. 
And a quick word of our -- on our goodwill. As you know, we undertake a prudent purchase press allocation process in the context of our M&A activity that prioritize the allocation to fixed assets. So the goodwill you see in our balance sheet only mirrors a deferred tax liability that arises from the higher fair value of assets acquired compared to the original tax base. Therefore, this never is not associated with a consideration paid in the cost -- context of any M&A ID. It's just an accountancy element according to IFRS rules. 
And finally, in Slide 13, a quick update on our capital structure and liquidity position. We have around EUR 23 billion of available liquidity, including EUR 11 billion of undrawn credit lines. Our net debt after our recent capital increase is close to 0; a strong backlog of contracted revenues at around EUR 110 billion; an average debt maturity of 7 years with a highly competitive cost of around 1.5%. No significant refinancing is expected before 2024. 86% of our debt is fixed, and our corporate debt has some covenant, no guarantee. This solid capital structure allow us to be in a comfortable position today and maintain our financial flexibility as we assess a wide array of available options to continue financing our organic and inorganic growth. 
And with this, let's please open the line for your questions."

And when we think about the organic growth going forward, maybe if you could give us a bit of color on the sort of embedded organic growth you think is in your 2025 guidance. That would be helpful as well. 
And then secondly on M&A. You mentioned you feel that the M&A that you're looking to, the EUR 9 billion of M&A, could take up to 18 months. I just wondered if by saying that, you're implying that, that is the sort of scale of M&A you expect to do. Or could there still be other variability within that? Clearly in the past, you've tended to deal as much faster. 
And when we think about the mix of deals going forward, you've obviously had some very large transactions in the last 6 months or so. I wonder if you can just comment as you think about your pipeline and opportunities you're looking at today. Are there still any sizable tickets out there of the sort of, I don't know, let's call it anything up to $10 billion size? Or are we talking about a much more bolt-on type M&A strategy for the coming year or so?"

And the logistics of applying for the funds, is it your customers that would apply or can Cellnex directly apply for these funds and deploy them accordingly?"

So on the first question, I think probably you're referring to Slide #18 and also probably maybe Slide #19. So what here we are trying to illustrate is not an issue in relation that we have having constraints on the spaces on the rooftops, for instance, in the case of the feature. It's more what we are intending to illustrate, is the capacity that alongside with our clients. In that case also, there is one vendor involved, but there are other vendors working in order to have our contribution on a faster rollout of 5G having combined antennas, which are multivan passive if you look at the central picture, which is the bottom part of the antenna, plus the active 3.5 gigahertz antenna on the top. And that's quite helpful because we are doing an intervention in order to deploy 5G, which is also helping to put some order into the landscape of the rooftop. So the visual impact is clearly improved, and those new developments around antennas are helping us, let's say, that alongside, we are rolling out faster than 5G. We are also having a better, say, a structure rooftop on the antennas. 
The next slide in Page 19 if you were also referring to that, this is another example of the things that we are developing alongside the vendor ecosystem in order to have also sort of street works kind of systems, which are shareable. Because in many cases, this is one of the elements that the initial designs are lacking the capacity of the equipment to be shared. And this is our late motive, isn't it? Then we are also trying to influence on the developments. That's the rationale for illustrating those pictures here. 
You are asking also in relation to Italy on the radiated emissions. That's true. And we are, in general, optimistic on the way that the relations being emitted are actually measured all over Europe. There is a need for urbanizing the way that this is measured. And we are, let's say, working on this. But the good element is that it really seems that we are going towards the right directions in all the countries, and that would potentially include Switzerland, which is one of the countries that there is, let's say, a different methodology when measuring the emitted radiation. 
And the last part of your question was referring to the next-generation funds. Well, we are precisely this week on the process of every government submitting to the EU the different initiatives. We are quite involved in many of them, and there are a bit of all kinds of different alignments and consortiums being created. So in some cases, we are leading it. In other cases, we are supporting our clients' initiatives. And in other cases, we are just behind our clients. So we -- well, we strive to be as compelling as possible in order to present projects, which are very much aligned with the needs of the European society, especially that has been proven after the pandemic, so how important is having good connectivity and so on. And this is where we have put most of our focus on providing good coverage everywhere."

So we've been quite prudent in the very beginning on the small cell deployment. What we are seeing is, let's say, some sort of traction more in indoor coverage, which is one of the elements that are collateral to the small cells. The small cell is initially, let's say, understood as something which is outdoor, where DAS systems and indoor coverage is one of the areas where we are, let's say, putting some effort because, yes, there is a need there. 
And in terms of how we see the market going forward on that, still, we are very much on the prudent side because with the new bands being made available for the MNOs, there is still the capacity of what we've been talking in the past of squeezing the macro. So when we would be talking about much higher frequencies like 26 gigahertz and these kind of elements, that might be different. We are not yet there. So our effort is very much on the -- well, deploying small cells where we have this capacity. And as you know, thanks to the Arqiva deal, we have capacity to have access to the London urban furniture. And yes, there is some developments there, but just with the MNOs where are maybe lacking a bit of frequencies. And clearly, it's a good example on how correlated is the access to the spectrum versus the need of small cells. So in that sense, we do not see any major, let's say, change on our forecast on how we believe the market may evolve, neither because the demand is -- the organic demand or because other, let's say, clients are vertically integrated with our company.

Secondly, Tobias, you're always very deliberate. And in your opening remarks, you highlighted that all options are open regarding M&A.

I was just wondering if you could maybe help us understand why the margin is quite so high. It looks like that there's no utilities or close to 0 utility charges in the French business.

Maybe a bit accelerated for the 5G rollout. I mean all of the telecom operators are accelerating the 5G rollout, but it's not relevant. It's not a relevant percentage. The vast majority, it's about pure, let me say, traditional kind of service. Jose Manuel?"

Regarding the first point, this slide, in fact, it's not the first time we shared with you, this is just pure optionability. It does not mean anything about our capital. Anything but our capital structure is full of flexibility, okay? But not in us. So we do think and I do think as a CFO that Cellnex has built not only a very strong balance sheet, but also has been able to build different financial instruments that allow us to increase our firepower in different ways. And this is -- maybe you can see that we are a crossover company, but we are able to issue at a very long-term maturity at 12 years, for instance. You can see how our coupons are very adjusted. You can see how banks are giving us credit lines long term with no hedge, no plates, no guarantee, no covenant. So we tend to --  I tend to feel, there is personal point, that many times, I am not able to explain well that service is not only about net debt to EBITDA, but also about other qualitative elements that some stakeholders like credit lines of bondholders appreciate. And maybe what I would like to share with all the market again is that service has plenty of financial flexibility to do many things in the next quarter or something. Nothing else apart from that."

Just to get a bit of an idea of what's driving the growth there. 
And my second question is on your agreement with Hutch. Yesterday, if you went out call, they suggested that some of the all or nothing agreements they have with you have some amendment clauses in the event of consolidation. Do you want just giving us an idea of how that works? And does that mean you commit less capital, which you can then redeploy into new deals? Just to get an idea of -- to the extent you can comment of the dynamics and integrations of that. 
And then my follow-up is on the EU recovery fund. I know you commented on that earlier. It will be great if you can give us any color on the mix of countries where you see the most benefit so we kind of get an idea of where to expect this kind of growth to accelerate."

Those are the markets where maybe waiting as a probability of being successful. Coming back to your first question, the majority of organic growth we are generating is -- well, first of all, it's a traditional MNO. So in the quarter, no activity in the commercial activity translated into PoP, strong fixed wireless access, so 100% MNOs. A note of this, as you can imagine, the vast majority is coming from Iliad. 
On the second question, I can maybe leave Alex to elaborate. Just maybe just to start, you know that our MSAs, our contracts with an cotenants, those are fully protected against any type of consolidation. That will be a change of control event, so we are protected against that. Just to provide you one example, we have already seen that in Italy with WIND and Hutch magic in the past with no impact on our current cash flows. And also, we are not expecting any impact on our on our future renewals because, again, the all or nothing clause applies. It's a indication.

The first is related to your cost savings and the second in some renewal for your contracts. On the cost savings, you provided guidance for 2021, 2022. And you also spilled out the two drivers: the lease optimization and the exploitation of the network cost synergies. I guess that in the quarter, most of the savings, they still come from optimization of the leases. So I was wondering, for your targets you have for 2022 of EUR 25 million to EUR 30 million, how much will be from network cost synergies and how much would be from lease optimization? 
And also if possible, if you can give an update of your EUR 90 million to EUR 100 million of recurring OpEx and lease savings by 2025. The reason I'm asking for that is because in the previous call, we're wondering about the synergies you can get by optimizing your network now that you're completing most of the acquisitions. At that stage, you say that you still have to check the real overlaps, so you're still going with the due diligence. The check -- I mean the contract at MSA and MLA, and for the MLA, you have to check the willingness of the clients to move. So I believe still a work in progress that guidance. So if you can provide, let's say, any sort of numbers, if you can see if the EUR 90 million to EUR 100 million, it's a base case scenario or it's a conservative or there could be upside to that given the how negotiation going and the integration plans you're currently implementing. 
Now you go to the second question is related to tower renewal. In your intro, you basically said that you're celebrating today the 6 years since the IPO, a lot of time this has passed by. So a lot of emphasis on new contracts and new acquisition, but I believe that you're now also reaching close to the first renewal. If I'm not mistaken, because now just my member since the IPO, the very first deal you signed was with Babel in Telefónica in Spain that was in 2012. It was for only 8, 10 years. And then was the bolt one in 2013. So I believe that over the next 1 or 2 years, you do starting some renewal. A lot of things have changed in terms of how you do contract. I believe that stage was mostly MLA, now MSA. Of course, there was no BTS at the stage. You do have now augmented tower core strategy. So I was just wondering if you can start spending a bit more, give us a bit more granularity if already you start engaging with the clients in terms of renewal and how is it going. And if pricing will be the main lever, is the clients willing to basically get more services from you and potentially even changed from the MLA to an MSA?"

So -- and of course, we are not well, never -- we expected to the last minute to have a discussion around these type of topics. We engaged discussions much earlier, and part of the elements that we've been developing since we first signed those contracts could be on the table. But the most important thing that will be preserved is what we, let's say, indicated by the beginning that those contracts potentially were renewed with a tunnel of pricing, which is plus/minus 5%, as we already disclosed previously. So nothing different than that. It's going to be on the table. And if there is something different, it would be for the benefit of the company."

Well, I will start with this one if you want to complement. No, I would say that for us, clearly, it's an opportunity that we are hoping to see translated in the number of fronts. 5G, we believe that -- well, depending on the final frequencies to be used in the actual deployment of 5G, we see higher frequencies being used, that will be translated into smaller cells. So there will be a loss of coverage to be compensated with most sites. So hopefully, we will be seeing more densification, densification that can be translated into more colocation, so new tenants on existing sites, but also in the areas where we cannot provide a service. Maybe there is an opportunity to provide even more size beyond the current build to suit programs that we have signed with clients. So maybe more tenancy rate increase, but also more build to suit. 
Also, we believe that while maybe at this stage, we are cautious about the small cell opportunity, so out of coverage based on the small cells, maybe we see more demand from clients when we see a final growth of 5 years. So macro sites will need to be complemented with small cells. And also, that is an area where we can -- we want to play a role. We are seeing today, demand for the coverage based on DAS. So that is an area where even today, we are making tangible progress to all stadiums, hospitals. As we are providing visibility on in the presentation, we are finding also an interesting opportunity in the area of transport network systems to provide connectivity. So we are also very active here. 
And then moving beyond, I would say, our traditional activity, we also think that makes sense for a neutral host to provide ancillary services around the tower and to extend our relationship with a encore client. We are already providing fiber portfolio for telecom in France. We are also starting to explore the possibility to move into mobile edge computing. Those are areas where more CapEx will be required. Maybe it makes sense for, again, a neutral operator to provide this CapEx to the service instead of the mobile operator. And then more [indiscernible], even why not to consider the possibility to enter into the active infrastructure area. So we see this as an ecosystem. We see this as a trend that will require our operators to think about their future CapEx needs in a different way. And adversely, more than happy to try and partner with our clients beyond micro towers, beyond what you see today."

So in relation to the PoP growth, which is not the only organic growth element to be considered, but when we talk exactly about PoP growth, certainly, there are 2 elements. One is coming out from the physics, which is related to the higher spectrum that is already impacting the 3.5 gigahertz. So what you are thinking on massive MIMO antennas do require more points of presence. And the other one is in relation to the bandwidth needs that requires also an additional densification. So it focused traffic which is linked to the consumption and the physics which are linked to the frequencies. And those are the 2 main levers of PoP growth. On [ collatery ] and on the top of that, there are other elements, like, as we mentioned before in the coverage and everything that is not counted as PoP, but it's also, let's say, the -- it's having exactly the same sort of types. 
So the second question in relation to the rooftops, and we are quite well experienced on that because when we did the first transaction precisely 6 years ago in Italy, by then, WIND was proposing in the portfolio quite a lot of rooftop. And one of the questions that we were asking ourselves, well, what was the potential cotenancy projections around that. And after six years, I think we have clearly demonstrated that the rooftop, it is also cotenancy sort of assets, because initially, that was one that we've experienced, let's say, the dynamics in Italy well. And it has been, let's say, a good driver of growth, the rooftops. The dynamics are not identical in every country. This is also true. But the experience that we're having in Italy, clearly, and in Spain as well, up to a certain point, but we'll -- and actually is helping us in order to have the right landlords contracts in order to facilitate that in the future. An example that we were mentioning before on the page 18 is part of the elements that we believe are important also in relation to the landlords to have not forest of antenna on the top of your house but have something which is more friendly in terms of visual impact as well."

Thank you so much for your time today, and thank you for sharing with us our birthday because we are celebrating today 6 years since our IPO. 
Let me please start by sharing with you the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation in the period continues to be strong and consistent with new PoPs on existing sites and our build to suit program, generating a 5.5% growth. We are also making tangible progress on our new efficiencies plan, in a way consistent with the lease optimization initiatives we have been implementing in the past. 
5G is becoming a reality, and we are identifying new opportunities arising from the need for a better connectivity where a neutral operator like Cellnex can play a key, such as transfer network systems. The period also provides a strong financial performance, with revenues increasing 40% compared to the last year, our adjusted EBITDA, 45%, and our recurring leverage free cash flow, 40%, with our backlog reaching EUR 110 billion when all our deals are closed. 
Just a few words on our right issue that we have recently concluded. It's been one of the largest offering in Europe and also globally in the last years, and 99.5% of rights holders have subscribed. So thank you very much. Thank you so much to our investors for your continued support and trust in this team. 
We are actively working on our EUR 9 billion pipeline of opportunities, which we are expecting to execute in the coming 18 months. And we are assessing these opportunities, maintaining our strict financial discipline. In terms of capital structure going forward, we are keeping all doors open, assessing a wide array of available options to continue financing our growth including equity partners at local level. 
And finally, we are reiterating our guidance with all fronts on track: organic growth generation, all financial metrics in line with our short- and medium-term outlook. Integration is a critical part of our growth strategy, and we can confirm that all our integration processes are on track, and we are also making progress on our new ESG master plan. 
If we move to Slide #3, we are showing here for illustrative purposes the expected profile of both adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leverage free cash flow during the remaining quarters of 2021. As you can see, these magnitudes will increase every quarter as we generate organic growth, make progress on our build to suit program and efficiency plan and see the contribution from new deals when they are closed. As a reminder, we are expecting our adjusted EBITDA to grow at around 55% and our recurring leverage free cash flow to grow at around 50% in 2021.
On the following slide, you can see the status of our current integration processes, which are performing as planned. In order to guarantee a sustainable long-term growth, Cellnex has identified -- has defined and implemented a global governance model with the following characteristics: responsibilities clearly distributed between group and countries; transversal policies, which can be adapted to the realities of each country. The model includes all company functions across our different markets: scalable company policies and procedures; easy monitoring using global dashboards, which allow a the tracking of KPIs; and supervisory and decision-making roles at all levels. 
If we go to Slide #5, just a quick review of our current footprint and financial metrics. When all our deals are closed and our build to suit program's complete, Cellnex will further strengthen its position in Europe as the main independent telecom infrastructure operator, managing a portfolio of around 130,000 sites with presence in 12 markets, boosting our financial and becoming the industrial partner of choice for our clients. Just a quick reminder of our medium-term guidance that implies an annual growth of more than 20% in our key financial metrics from 2020 and a very well diversified expected EBITDA in 2025 of between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion. 
On Slide #6, we are showing our updated shareholding structure after our capital increase, and we can only be grateful, again, for the continued support from investors and for sharing the long-term view of this management team. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, Jose Manuel Aisa, who will provide you a few more details."

Moving to Slide 8, providing a few more details on the period. Revenues have increased 40% to EUR 506 million in the quarter. Our recurring level free cash flow has increased 40% to EUR 180 million. Our total PoPs have increased 65%, in",702,"Thank you, Tobias. Moving to Slide 8, providing a few more details on the period. Revenues have increased 40% to EUR 506 million in the quarter. Our recurring level free cash flow has increased 40% to EUR 180 million. Our total PoPs have increased 65%, including the contribution from organic growth and M&A. And if we focus on organic growth only, that is excluding any change of perimeter, PoPs have increased around 5.5% compared to last year as a result of the continued network densification process we are seeing across Europe and in line with our medium-term guidance. 
Moving now to our main metrics in Slide #9. On top of the figures, just discussed, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 45% compared to last year, and our margin has increased to 76% from 74%. If we look at the figures in the table, you can see that this adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly explained by the contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services, organic growth, build to suit and recent acquisitions and by the efficient management of our cost base. Payment of leases have increased due to a larger site portfolio. Maintenance CapEx is expected to convert towards our guidance during the year, and interest base reflects the terms of our debt structure and our available liquidity. 
On the following slide, #10, which explains our recurring levered free cash flow generation, you can see the contribution to organic growth from our different drivers: colocation and associated services, build to suit, escalators and efficiencies. These elements combined generate EUR 24 million in the period, a 20% growth compared to Q1 last year in the period. And if we also take the additional contribution from our recent deals and the rest of cash elements below adjusted EBITDA, Cellnex has generated a strong recurring level free cash flow growth of 42% compared to last year. 
Moving to Slide 11. You can see our progress on our new efficiency plan. Please note that site management has always played a key role in our operations, and we have been extremely successfully extracting efficiencies out of our portfolio in the past, but we just want to provide additional visibility in our new plan so you can track our progress. We have renegotiated more than 700 ground lease contracts in the period, generated EUR 4 million of annualized efficiencies, and we are on track to meet our efficiencies and synergies target in 2025. 
Moving to our balance sheet. Movements compared to December last year are mainly explained by our M&A activity in the period. Increase in total assets as a result of our M&A activity and the corresponding increased liability as a result of the issuance of debt in this period. Please note that this picture does not include the proceeds of our recent capital increase. 
And a quick word of our -- on our goodwill. As you know, we undertake a prudent purchase press allocation process in the context of our M&A activity that prioritize the allocation to fixed assets. So the goodwill you see in our balance sheet only mirrors a deferred tax liability that arises from the higher fair value of assets acquired compared to the original tax base. Therefore, this never is not associated with a consideration paid in the cost -- in the context of any M&A ID. It's just an accountancy element according to IFRS rules. 
And finally, in Slide 13, a quick update on our capital structure and liquidity position. We have around EUR 23 billion of available liquidity, including EUR 11 billion of undrawn credit lines. Our net debt after our recent capital increase is close to 0; a strong backlog of contracted revenues at around EUR 110 billion; an average debt maturity of 7 years with a highly competitive cost of around 1.5%. No significant refinancing is expected before 2024. 86% of our debt is fixed, and our corporate debt has no covenant, no pledge, no guarantee. This solid capital structure allow us to be in a comfortable position today and maintain our financial flexibility as we assess a wide array of available options to continue financing our organic and inorganic growth. 
And with this, let's please open the line for your questions."

And when we think about the organic growth going forward, maybe if you could give us a bit of color on the sort of embedded organic growth you think is in your 2025 guidance. That would be helpful as well. 
And then secondly on M&A. You mentioned you feel that the M&A that you're looking to, the EUR 9 billion of M&A, could take up to 18 months. I just wondered if by saying that, you're implying that, that is the sort of scale of M&A you expect to do. Or could there still be other variability within that? Clearly in the past, you've tended to deals much faster. 
And when we think about the mix of deals going forward, you've obviously had some very large transactions in the last 6 months or so. I wonder if you can just comment as you think about your pipeline and opportunities you're looking at today. Are there still any sizable tickets out there of the sort of, I don't know, let's call it anything up to $10 billion size? Or are we talking about a much more bolt-on type M&A strategy for the coming year or so?"

And secondly, on the next-generation funds, again, you've provided some high-level view in your slide deck. What markets do you think you can benefit the most from? And the logistics of applying for the funds, is it your customers that would apply or can Cellnex directly apply for these funds and deploy them accordingly?"

So on the first question, I think probably you're referring to Slide #18 and also probably maybe Slide #19.

So on the first question, I think probably you're referring to Slide #18 and also probably maybe Slide #19. So what here we are trying to illustrate is not an issue in relation that we are having constraints on the spaces on the rooftops, for instance, in the case of the feature. It's more what we are intending to illustrate, is the capacity that alongside with our clients. In that case also, there is one vendor involved, but there are other vendors working in order to have our contribution on a faster rollout of 5G having combined antennas, which are multiband passive if you look at the central picture, which is the bottom part of the antenna, plus the active 3.5 gigahertz antenna on the top. 
And that's quite helpful because we are doing an intervention in order to deploy 5G, which is also helping to put some order into the landscape of the rooftop. So the visual impact is clearly improved, and those new developments around antennas are helping us, let's say, that alongside, we are rolling out faster the 5G. We are also having a better, say, a structure rooftop on the antennas. 
The next slide in Page 19 if you were also referring to that, this is another example of the things that we are developing alongside the vendor ecosystem in order to have also sort of street works kind of systems, which are shareable. Because in many cases, this is one of the elements that the initial designs are lacking the capacity of the equipment to be shared. And this is our late motive, isn't it? Then we are also trying to influence on the developments. That's the rationale for illustrating those pictures here. 
You were asking also in relation to Italy on the radiated emissions. That's true. And we are, in general, optimistic on the way that the radiations being emitted are actually measured all over Europe. There is a need for urbanizing the way that this is measured. And we are, let's say, working on this. But the good element is that it really seems that we are going towards the right directions in all the countries, and that would potentially include Switzerland, which is one of the countries that there is, let's say, a different methodology when measuring the emitted radiation. 
And the last part of your question was referring to the next-generation funds. Well, we are precisely this week on the process of every government submitting to the EU the different initiatives. We are quite involved in many of them, and there are a bit of all kinds of different alignments and consortiums being created. 
So in some cases, we are leading it. In other cases, we are supporting our clients' initiatives. And in other cases, we are just behind our clients. So we -- well, we strive to be as compelling as possible in order to present projects, which are very much aligned with the needs of the European society, especially that has been proven after the pandemic, so how important is having good connectivity and so on. And this is where we have put most of our focus on providing good coverage everywhere."

So we've been quite prudent in the very beginning on the small cell deployment. What we are seeing is, let's say, some sort of traction more in indoor coverage, which is one of the elements that are collateral to the small cells. The small cell is initially, let's say, understood as something which is outdoor, where DAS systems and indoor coverage is one of the areas where we are, let's say, putting some effort because, yes, there is a need there. 
And in terms of how we see the market going forward on that, still, we are very much on the prudent side because with the new bands being made available for the MNOs, there is still the capacity of what we've been talking in the past of squeezing the macro, no? So when we would be talking about much higher frequencies like 26 gigahertz and these kind of elements, that might be different. We are not yet there. 
So our effort is very much on the, well, deploying small cells where we have this capacity. And as you know, thanks to the Arqiva deal, we have capacity to have access to the London urban furniture. And yes, there is some developments there, but just with the MNOs where are maybe lacking a bit of frequencies. And clearly, it's a good example on how correlated is the access to the spectrum versus the need of the small cells. 
So in that sense, we do not see any major, let's say, change on our forecast on how we believe the market may evolve, neither because the demand is -- the organic demand or because other, let's say, clients are vertically integrated with our company. So we don't see that as the potential barrier for us having access to this market when actually may develop in the future."

Secondly, Tobias, you're always very deliberate. And in your opening remarks, you highlighted that all options are open regarding M&A.

I mean it's not maybe too different from what we have seen in the past. We think it's solid, predictable and also underpinned by the general certification needs that we are seeing across Europe.

My second question was just on France. You very helpfully have provided a split-out of the French business effects unit in your Excel sheet today, which is always quite interesting. I just had a question on the margin there. I think you report EUR 78 million of EBITDA on EUR 85 million of revenues. So something like a sort of 92% EBITDA margin for the French business. I was just wondering if you could maybe help us understand why the margin is quite so high. It looks like that there's no utilities or close to 0 utility charges in the French business. So maybe it's just a sort of cost allocation, but just interested on how sustainable is that very high margin that you reported for your French business."

The answer is yes, I guess there are some slight differences compared to the -- to other markets in the sense of -- I mean, for example, in France, we are not providing the electricity service. It is up to the mobile operator to sign an electricity contract with electricity supplier. So we are not involved in that link of the value chain. That increases the margin. 
And then also the separate high margin, that also -- it's directly associated with the contracted revenues that we are receiving from our core tenants. So I would say that [ osmosis ] playing this margin. Maybe a bit accelerated for the 5G rollout. I mean all of the telecom operators are accelerating the 5G rollout, but it's not relevant.

And this is -- maybe you can see that we are a crossover company, but we are able to issue at a very long-term maturity at 12 years, for instance. You can see how our coupons are very adjusted. You can see how banks are giving us credit lines long term with no hedge, no pledge, no guarantee, no covenant. 
So we tend to --  I tend to feel, maybe it's a personal point, that many times, I am not able to explain well that service is not only about net debt to EBITDA, but also about other qualitative elements that some stakeholders like credit lines or bondholders appreciate.

The first is related to your cost savings and the second in some renewal for your contracts. On the cost savings, you provided guidance for 2021, 2022. And you also spilled out the two drivers: the lease optimization and the exploitation of the network cost synergies. I guess that in the quarter, most of the savings, they still come from optimization of the leases. So I was wondering, for your targets you have for 2022 of EUR 25 million to EUR 30 million, how much will be from network cost synergies and how much would be from lease optimization? 
And also if possible, if you can give an update of your EUR 90 million to EUR 100 million of recurring OpEx and lease savings by 2025. The reason I'm asking for that is because in the previous call, we're wondering about the synergies you can get by optimizing your network now that you're completing most of the acquisitions. At that stage, you say that you still have to check the real overlaps, so you're still going with the due diligence. 
The check -- I mean with the contract at MSA and MLA, and for the MLA, you have to check the willingness of the clients to move. So I believe still a work in progress, that guidance. So if you cannot provide, let's say, any sort of numbers, if you can see if the EUR 90 million to EUR 100 million, it's a base case scenario or it's a conservative or there could be upside to that given that how negotiation are going and the integration plans you're currently implementing. 
Now going to the second question is related to tower renewal. In your intro, you basically said that you're celebrating today the 6 years since the IPO, a lot of time this has passed by. So a lot of emphasis on new contracts and new acquisition, but I believe that you're now also reaching close to the first renewal, if I'm not mistaken, because now -- just my memory since the IPO, the very first deal you signed was with Babel and Telefónica in Spain that was in 2012. It was for only 8, 10 years. And then was the bolt one in 2013. 
So I believe that over the next 1 or 2 years, you do starting some renewal. A lot of things have changed in terms of how you do contract. I believe that stage was mostly MLA, now MSA. Of course, there was no BTS at the stage. You do have now augmented tower core strategy. So I was just wondering if you can start spending a bit more -- give us a bit more granularity if already you start engaging with the clients in terms of renewal and how is it going. And if pricing will be the main lever, if the client's willing to basically get more services from you and potentially even changed from the MLA to an MSA?"

So well, those are good times, as you well suggested to maybe reconsider what could be a change from the initial status quo. So -- and of course, we are not well, never -- we expected to the last minute to have a discussion around these type of topics. We engaged discussions much earlier, and part of the elements that we've been developing since we first signed those contracts could be on the table. But the most important thing that will be preserved is what we, let's say, indicated by the beginning that those contracts potentially were renewed with a tunnel of pricing, which is plus/minus 5%, as we already disclosed previously. So nothing different than that. It's going to be on the table. And if there is something different, it would be for the benefit of the company."

No, I would say that for us, clearly, it's an opportunity that we are hoping to see translated in the number of fronts. 5G, we believe that -- well, depending on the final frequencies to be used in the actual deployment of 5G, if we see higher frequencies being used, that will be translated into smaller cells. So there will be a loss of coverage to be compensated with most sites. 
So hopefully, we will be seeing more densification, densification that can be translated into more colocation, so new tenants on existing sites, but also in the areas where we cannot provide a service. Maybe there is an opportunity to provide even more size beyond the current build to suit programs that we have signed with clients. So maybe more tenancy rate increase, but also more build to suit. 
Also, we believe that while maybe at this stage, we are cautious about the small cell opportunity, so out of coverage based on the small cells, maybe we see more demand from clients when we see a final growth of 5 years. So macro sites will need to be complemented with the small cells. And also, that is an area where we can -- we want to play a role. 
We are seeing today, demand for either coverage based on DAS. So that is an area where even today, we are making tangible progress to all stadiums, hospitals. As we are providing visibility on in the presentation, we are finding also an interesting opportunity in the area of transport network systems to provide connectivity. So we are also very active here. 
And then moving beyond, I would say, our traditional activity, we also think that makes sense for a neutral host to provide ancillary services around the tower and to extend our relationship with a current anchor client. We are already providing fiber portfolio for Bouygues Telecom in France. We are also starting to explore the possibility to move into mobile edge computing. Those are areas where more CapEx will be required. 
Maybe it makes sense for, again, a neutral operator to provide this CapEx to the service instead of the mobile operator. And then more [indiscernible], even why not to consider the possibility to enter into the active infrastructure area. So we see this as an ecosystem. We see this as a trend that will require mobile operators to think about their future CapEx needs in a different way.

And the second question is around rooftop upleasing. This has been a big subject, obviously, for American Tower in Germany and Vantage. Anything you can say about how that's going for you, for example, in France and how difficult or easy it is to lease-up rooftops?"

So in relation to the PoP growth, which is not the only organic growth element to be considered, but when we talk precisely about PoP growth, certainly, there are 2 elements. One is coming out from the physics, which is related to the higher spectrum",375,"Yes. So in relation to the PoP growth, which is not the only organic growth element to be considered, but when we talk precisely about PoP growth, certainly, there are 2 elements. One is coming out from the physics, which is related to the higher spectrum that is already impacting the 3.5 gigahertz. So what you are thinking on massive MIMO antennas do require more points of presence. 
And the other one is in relation to the bandwidth needs that requires also an additional densification. So it focused traffic, which is linked to the consumption and the physics, which are linked to the frequencies. And those are the 2 main levers of PoP growth. On [indiscernible] and on the top of that, there are other elements, like, as we mentioned before, indoor coverage and everything that is not counted as PoP, but it's also, let's say, the -- it's having exactly the same sort of types. 
So the second question in relation to the rooftops, and we are quite well experienced on that because when we did the first transaction precisely 6 years ago in Italy, by then, WIND was proposing in the portfolio quite a lot of rooftops. And one of the questions that we were asking ourselves, well, what was the potential cotenancy projections around that. And after 6 years, I think we have clearly demonstrated that the rooftop, it is also cotenancy sort of assets, because initially, that was one that we've experienced, let's say, the dynamics in Italy well. 
And it has been, let's say, a good driver of growth, the rooftops. The dynamics are not identical in every country. This is also true. But the experience that we're having in Italy, clearly, and in Spain as well, up to a certain point, but we'll -- and actually is helping us in order to have the right landlords contracts in order to facilitate that in the future. 
An example that we were mentioning before on the Page 18 is part of the elements that we believe are important also in relation to the landlords to have not a forest of antenna on the top of your house but have something, which is more friendly in terms of visual impact as well."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us today. Please go straight in the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation continues to be strong with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit program gene",778,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us today. Please go straight in the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation continues to be strong with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit program generating 7.5% growth. Please note that the main driver behind this strong growth in the period has been the significant contribution from build to suit with around 1,000 new sites transferred in Q2 2021. And taking into consideration that we are delivering such kind of build-to-suit in the middle of the pandemia, which is remarkable. 
We are also making tangible progress on our efficiency front in a way consistent with the lease optimization initiatives we have been implementing over the last -- last years. The period also provides a strong financial performance with revenues increasing 47% compared to the last year. Our adjusted EBITDA, 53%, and our recurring leverage free cash flow 47%, with our EBITDA margin expanding 400 basis points to 79%. 
As you know, ESG is a cornerstone of our strategy. And as such, we are making a steady progress on the initiatives set out in our new ESG master plan. An example of this is the sustained analytics recent risk rating, improving 4 points and placing Cellnex among the top 5 companies in the telecom sector. 
We are also happy to share the creation of the Cellnex Foundation with the objective to narrow the digital and social devices through projects that will improve the access to connectivity. Our intention is to create a dynamic tool at the service of people, tackling situations of vulnerability while contributing to the improvement of the environment. 
Moving to capital structure strategy. In order to fund our growth, we continue keeping all doors open, and we are constantly assessing a wide array of options to maintain our financial flexibility. One as an example of this pragmatic approach is our -- in our bond in dollars. We have tapped the most liquid market for the first time, issuing our longest ever instrument and at a very competitive cost. 
Integration is also a [indiscernible] for the success of our growth strategy. In this sense, we are very happy with the progress made on our closing processes with even some deals closed earlier than expected and all our integration projects are advancing in line with our initial expectations. 
And finally, we are upgrading our guidance mainly reflecting the early closing of the Polkomtel deal, and we are also reiterating our medium-term guidance with all metrics on track. 
We go to Slide #3, we are showing here for illustrative purposes, the expected profile of both adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow during the remaining quarters of 2021. As you can see, these magnitudes will increase every quarter as we generate organic growth, make progress on our build-to-suit programs and efficiencies plan and see the contribution from new deals as they are closed. 
Our upgraded guidance implies an expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 65% and a recurring leverage free cash flow growth of [ close than ] 60% compared to 2020. 
On the following slide, you can see the status of our current integration processes. And the main conclusion is that all of them are going as planned. Compared to the previous quarter, you can see that we have closed the Infra in The Netherlands, Hutch Italian deal and Polkomtel, while we are actively working on our 2 pending closing -- closings, Ivory in France and Hutch U.K. 
We have implemented a global and governance model with the following characteristics. Clearly, distributed responsibilities between group and countries; transversal policies, which can be adapted to the realities of each country; use of global dashboards, which allows the tracking of KPIs; and also supervisory and decision-making roles at all levels. 
If we go to Slide #5, just a quick review of our current footprint and financial targets. When all of our deals are closed and our build-to-suit firms completed, Cellnex will further strengthen its position in Europe as the main independent telecom infrastructure operator, managing a portfolio of around 130,000 sites, with present in 12 months -- in 12 markets and boosting our financial and becoming the industrial partner of choice for our clients. 
Finally, a quick reminder of our medium-term guidance, which we are reiterating. It implies an annual growth of well above 20% in our key financial metrics from 2020 and a very well-diversified expected EBITDA in 2025 of between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, Jose Manuel Aisa, who will provide a few more details of the period."

Revenues have increased around [ 3% ] to EUR 1,061 million in the period. Our recurring leverage free cash flow has increased 50% to EUR 394 million. Our total PoPs are almost double if we include the contribution from organic growth and M&A. And if we focus on organic growth only, our PoPs have increased around 7.5% compared here as a result of the increased colocation and acceleration of our build-to-suit programs. 
Please note that our PoPs do not include sharing, tenancies or IoT tenancies. And also, please note that we maintain the guidance unchanged. 
Moving now to Slide 8. The performance of our main metrics on top of the figures just discussed, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 53% compared to last year, and our margin has expanded around 400 basis points. This adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly explained by the contribution from telecom infrastructure services, organic growth, build-to-suit and recent acquisitions and by the efficient management of our cost base. 
Payment of leases increased with a larger portfolio of sites. Maintenance CapEx is expected to converge towards our guidance. And interest paid reflects the terms of our debt structure. 
The following slide explains our recurring leverage free cash flow generation in the period. And you can see the contribution to organic growth on our different drivers, colocation and associated services, build-to-suit, escalators and efficiencies. These elements, combined, generated EUR 52 million in the period, a 20% growth compared to last year. And if we also take the contribution from M&A and the rest of the cash items below adjusted EBITDA, Cellnex has generated again a strong recurring levered free cash flow growth of 47% compared to last year. 
Moving to Slide 10, a quick update on our efficiency plan. Please note that the site management has had to play a key role in our operations. And we have a strong traffic or crystallizing efficiencies out of our portfolios of sites. We have renegotiated close to [ 1,500 ] on leases contracts in the period, generated EUR 7 million of efficiency this year so far, and we are on track to meet our 2025 target. 
Moving to our balance sheet movements compared to last year and mainly explained by our M&A and capital structure activity in the period. The increase in total assets as explains the corresponding increase in equity and liabilities as a result of our last rights issue and the issuance of debt instruments in the period, respectively. And just to remind that we take a prudent special allocation approach in the context of our M&A activities that prioritize the location to fix assets. So the goodwill, you can see in our balance sheet, does not correspond to any cash out. You will find a thorough explanation in the frequently asked questions section. 
Now a quick update of our capital structure and liquidity position. We have around EUR 19 billion of available liquidity, including EUR 11 billion of undrawn credit lines; a strong backlog of contracted revenues at around EUR 110 billion; an average debt maturity of 7 years with a highly competitive associated cost of around 1.5%. The significant refining is expected before 2024. 86% of our debt is fixed. And our corporate debt has no covenant pledge [indiscernible]. 
And very quickly on our upgraded 2021 financial outlook in Slide 15, which mostly reflects the early closing of the Port of [ Montel ] deal. It implies an expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 65% and the current free cash flow close to 60% compared to 2020.

You recorded a mild deceleration on revenues from new colocation associated revenues, EUR 87 million compared with EUR 9 million in the first quarter. That is against the acceleration of the PoP. Now you also said that the PoP in -- the acceleration comes from the BTS. 
So I was wondering if you can give us the breakdown with the PoPs on your existing towers and the one from the BTS. 
The second question is on a point you made in the presentation, the purchase pricing acquisition. Now my understanding is that the aim is to attribute the price paid to intangibles that could be depreciated and provide tax shields while goodwill is not appreciated. So the further question is, as the process completed for all the acquisition you announced or is it ongoing with the auditors? And it's still ongoing in terms of the allocation of the price towards intangible versus goodwill. Could that impact the 2025 guidance that you have for EUR 2 billion to EUR 2.2 billion? 
And the third is just for clarification. The CMA recent completion in turn, it's an ongoing process. And so I understand that is difficult for you to comment.

On the second question. On the PPI, Ottavio, we have never changed the criteria. And you know the criteria is the following. The auditor has 1 year and the management of Cellnex has 1 year to present the amendments to PPIs that are initially recorded in our books. We have always agreed with the auditor, no change in our initial or PPA. And therefore, we do not expect any impact at all in the 2025 outlook. So I would suggest if -- to go through -- if you can go through Slide 26, for instance, that's helpful and also our semestral accounts, you will see that the criteria which has not changed. And no impact in the free cash flow. So the answer is simple. No change. 
And the third question, that is maybe a difficult answer. I guess that -- I remind that we haven't gone through any European process, European by process.

And we -- when we came into a country, we'll take what it is, and we want to build based on what it is. 
So however, on that point, we have sometimes a mixed, let's say, feeling because when there is the possibility to raise the colocation missions, the colocation expect could also go high, but also could go higher in rent sharing. Whereas because of rent sharing, as you know, there are additional carriers on the same side, so the mission being radiated is also increasing. In the event that this is not possible, another site may be required nearby at, let's say, reasonable distance in order not to affect the radiations around the original site. So this is also generating a new demand for densification as [indiscernible] was mentioning before. 
So that's the element that we do see, and we believe the MNOs in Italy have been already considering. So all those that we are thinking on doing rent sharing, that may be having an impact. That's possible. And they may require a physical PoP at a certain distance from the original one. In the case of Italy, so the players that we're thinking of doing so, maybe that could potentially have them. So there will be less rent sharing, more physical points of presence.

So what we are always willing is to cooperate, to find the better way in order to ensure that what the -- this project is actually looking after is best share with the minimum resources and not overspending. Here, we have, let's say, the Spanish government that has yet to, let's say, release the public tender proposals. And maybe the public tender will already face the situation on different ways that we may have initially envisaged with our EV or the MNOs themselves have initially envisaged or even the vendors, because the sources for the funding could be devoted to passive, to passive plus active or both of them or just one of them. 
So what we know is on this standby mode, proposals, as expression of interest, have been already presented to the Spanish government. I think the Spanish government has a very clear idea on what can be done or not. And that will be translated in a tender process. So hopefully, we'll be in a position to have a really cooperating project around that, and that's what we really expect to happen. 
Then on the second question in relation to transportation lines. Look, we believe that this has life on its own even without recovery funds because it's a real demand. And we have started, let's say, working around that. As you know, even -- even the sad situation of the pandemic actually happen.  Independently from the recovery fund, we expect to be in a position to, let's say, provide good news in the future around that in other areas where we are, let's say, commercially pushing for developing these type of services.

And on the build-to-suit, I think on our 2020 results presentation on the Annexes, Page 29, there was 1 slide trying to illustrate the different synergies because not only is the build-to-suit against build-to-suit that may actually be safe here. It's a build-to-suit against a legacy side that we may be having from the portfolio or could be between 2 legacy sites. 
So in the case of build-to-suit, which if I understand correctly, this is what you were asking for, we do not build the 2 sites and then we do movement of the 1 or 2 sites. We avoid building one of the sites. So this means there are 2 types of savings. First of all, the ground lease of one of the sites; and secondly, the CapEx for building one of the sites. And this is the way we approach this build-to-suit against build-to-suit synergies. I don't know if that helps."

What we are realizing is that many of the MNOs are still using radio frequency links to power up 1 5G, and the fiber maybe envisage in the future because the traffic being generated by this 5G is very small because the number of handsets yet being available. So there are very few handsets yet in the market. So therefore, the traffic that this 5G has to be handled, it's small enough to reduce the backhauling to the tower that was already existing before powering up 1 5G. 
What is clear is that at the end, the fiber will be required because the bandwidth, when you have all the frequencies per site, will require another means of backhauling every site beyond the radio frequency linked which is what today is being used. So the market is there, but what now is being put as priority by the MNO is just powering up 5G because it's also part of their regulatory obligations, and the backhauling will come later on."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please go straight to the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation continues to be strong with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit",772,"Thank you, Juan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please go straight to the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation continues to be strong with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit program generating 7.5% growth. Please note that the main driver behind this strong growth in the period has been the significant contribution from build to suit with around 1,000 new sites transferred in Q2 2021 and taking into consideration that we are delivering such kind of build to suit in the middle of the pandemia, which is remarkable.
We are also making tangible progress on our efficiency plan in a way consistent with the lease optimization initiatives we have been implementing over the past -- last years. The period also provides a strong financial performance with revenues increasing 47% compared to the last year; our adjusted EBITDA, 53%; and our recurring leverage free cash flow, 47%; with our EBITDA margin expanding 400 basis points to 79%.
As you know, ESG is a cornerstone of our strategy. And as such, we are making a steady progress on the initiatives set out in our new ESG master plan. An example of this is the Sustainalytics recent risk rating, improving 4 points and placing Cellnex among the top 5 companies in the telecom sector.
We are also happy to share the creation of The Cellnex Foundation with the objective to narrow the digital and social divide through projects that will improve the access to connectivity. Our intention is to create a dynamic tool at the service of people, tackling situations of vulnerability while contributing to the improvement of the environment.
Moving to capital structure strategy. In order to fund our growth, we continue keeping all doors open, and we are constantly assessing a wide array of options to maintain our financial flexibility. One example of this pragmatic approach is our inaugural bond in dollars. We have tapped the most liquid market for the first time, issuing our longest ever instrument and at a very competitive cost.
Integration is also crucial for the success of our growth strategy. In this sense, we are very happy with the progress made on our closing processes with even some deals closed earlier than expected and all our integration projects are advancing in line with our initial expectations.
And finally, we are upgrading our guidance mainly reflecting the early closing of the Polkomtel deal, and we are also reiterating our medium-term guidance with all metrics on track.
We go to Slide #3. We are showing here, for illustrative purposes, the expected profile of both adjusted EBITDA and recurring leverage free cash flow during the remaining quarters of 2021. As you can see, these magnitudes will increase every quarter as we generate organic growth, make progress on our build-to-suit programs and efficiencies plan and see the contribution from new deals as they are closed.
Our upgraded guidance implies an expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 65% and a recurring leverage free cash flow growth of close than (sic) [ close to ] 60% compared to 2020.
On the following slide, you can see the status of our current integration processes. And the main conclusion is that all of them are going as planned. Compared to the previous quarter, you can see that we have closed T-Infra in The Netherlands, Hutch Italian deal and Polkomtel, while we are actively working on our 2 pending closings, Hivory in France and Hutch U.K.
We have implemented a global governance model with the following characteristics: clearly, distributed responsibilities between group and countries; transversal policies, which can be adapted to the realities of each country; use of global dashboards, which allows the tracking of KPIs; and also supervisory and decision-making roles at all levels.
If we go to Slide #5, just a quick review of our current footprint and financial targets. When all of our deals are closed and our build-to-suit programs completed, Cellnex will further strengthen its position in Europe as the main independent telecom infrastructure operator, managing a portfolio of around 130,000 sites with presence in 12 markets, and boosting our financial and becoming the industrial partner of choice for our clients.
Finally, a quick reminder of our medium-term guidance, which we are reiterating. It implies an annual growth of well above 20% in our key financial metrics from 2020 and a very well-diversified expected EBITDA in 2025 of between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion.
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, Jose Manuel Aisa, who will provide a few more details of the period."

Moving to Slide 7 and providing a few more details on the period. Revenues have increased around 50% to EUR 1,061 million in the period.

Revenues have increased around 50% to EUR 1,061 million in the period. Our recurring levered free cash flow has increased 50% to EUR 394 million. Our total PoPs are almost double if we include the contribution from organic growth and M&A. And if we focus on organic growth only, our PoPs have increased around 7.5% compared last year as a result of the increased colocation and acceleration of our build-to-suit programs.
Please note that our PoPs do not include rent sharing tenancies or IoT tenancies. And also, please note that we maintain the guidance unchanged.
Moving now to Slide 8. The performance of our main metrics on top of the figures just discussed, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 53% compared to last year, and our margin has expanded around 400 basis points. This adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly explained by the contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services, organic growth, build to suit and recent acquisitions, and by the efficient management of our cost base.
Payment of leases increased with a larger portfolio of sites. Maintenance CapEx is expected to converge towards our guidance, and interest paid reflects the terms of our debt structure.
The following slide explains our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period, and you can see the contribution to organic growth on our different drivers, colocation and associated services, build to suit, escalators, and efficiencies. These elements combined generated EUR 52 million in the period, a 20% growth compared to last year. And if we also take the contribution from M&A and the rest of cash items below adjusted EBITDA, Cellnex has generated again a strong recurring levered free cash flow growth of 47% compared to last year.
Moving to Slide 10, a quick update on our efficiency plan. Please note that the site management has always played a key role in our operations, and we have a strong track record crystallizing efficiencies out of our portfolios of sites. We have renegotiated close to 1,500 ground leases contracts in the period, generated EUR 7 million of efficiencies this year so far, and we are on track to meet our 2025 target.
Moving to our balance sheet movements compared to last year and mainly explained by our M&A and capital structure activity in the period. The increase in total assets also explains the corresponding increase in equity and liabilities as a result of our last rights issue and the issuance of debt instruments in the period, respectively. And just to remind that we take a prudent purchase price allocation approach in the context of our M&A activities that prioritize the location to fix assets. So the goodwill you can see in our balance sheet does not correspond to any cash out. You will find a thorough explanation in the frequently asked questions section.
Now a quick update of our capital structure and liquidity position. We have around EUR 19 billion of available liquidity, including EUR 11 billion of undrawn credit lines; a strong backlog of contracted revenues at around EUR 110 billion; an average debt maturity of 7 years with a highly competitive associated cost of around 1.5%. The significant [ refining ] is expected before 2024. 86% of our debt is fixed. And our corporate debt has no covenant, pledge or guarantees.
And very quickly on our upgraded 2021 financial outlook in Slide 13, which mostly reflects the early closing of the Polkomtel deal. It implies an expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 65% and a recurring levered free cash flow close to 60% compared to 2020.

And whilst everything is tracking according to your H1 [ '20 ] time frame, it would be really interesting to know what some of those measures you presented were and maybe why the CMA weren't comfortable with those initially.
And secondly, just moving to Italy. Now in your KPI file, you've obviously included now the Hutch Italy deal, which is closed. So it's a bit difficult to see how the organic PoP growth tracked there. Are you seeing any upside in Italy given the delays from Inwit and being able to get some of the Iliad PoPs on there? Are you benefiting there? I know obviously, you have the build to suit and you are the default provider for Iliad. But any upside there? And anything you could say would be good? 
And just maybe tied on to that. Tracking with your synergy run rate, you saw a material increase in the organic PoP growth this quarter. Should we think that the synergy run rate is closely aligned to that organic PoP growth given the scope for the combination of build to suits?"

Maybe I will maybe reverse the order in terms of answer, so starting with your last one. Maybe short answer is too early to say. Bear in mind that it is true that we have [ of course ] set up quite a strong organic growth this quarter. We think it's just a timing effect. So you know that there is a perimeter of sites to be deployed in our anchor tenants in the context of the different build-to-suite programs. The speed at which we have been able to integrate sites this quarter has been faster than anticipated, but the perimeter is what it is. So after the completion of these build-to-suite programs, we will be able to deploy the sites that we announced at the moment of those transactions.
In terms of the progress that we are making on our efficiencies and synergies programs, we are happy with the progress. The vast majority of these savings are mostly related to ground lease renegotiations rather than synergies or build-to-suit optimization. But as we make progress and have more information, we're happy to provide a more updated picture. But as of today, we are not in a position to change our view.
Now your second question, no, I mean, we are happy with the performance that we are generating with organic growth that we're generating in Italy. We are not seeing any change or any acceleration due to any relationship that Iliad or Inwit might have. So we'll continue executing our plan, and the way we see our organic [ generation ] in Italy is consistent with the performance that we have posted during previous quarters.

But again, I think we should work together with the CMA in order to make a new market assessment, which will be key. But I think the facts are clear. This is not just about opinions, so there is a new market structure in U.K. rather than the previous IPO of Vantage in the market.

You recorded a mild deceleration on revenues from new colocation-associated revenues, EUR 87 million compared with EUR 9 million in the first quarter. That is against the acceleration of the PoP. Now you also said that the PoP in -- the acceleration comes from the BTS. So I was wondering if you can give us the breakdown with the PoPs on your existing towers and the one from the BTS.
The second question is on a point you made during the presentation, the purchase pricing acquisition. Now my understanding is that the aim is to attribute the price paid to intangible that could be depreciated and provide tax shields while goodwill is not appreciated. So the further question is, is the process completed for all the acquisition you announced or is it ongoing with the auditors. And it's still ongoing in terms of the allocation of the price towards intangible versus goodwill. Could that impact the 2025 guidance that you have for EUR 2 billion to EUR 2.2 billion?
And the third is just for clarification. The CMA recent completion in turn, it's an ongoing process and totally understand that it's difficult for you to comment.

In relation to Spain, look, not really we do expect here any potential reduction of the addressable market, to be honest, because MASMOVIL has been always quite pragmatic on the way that they have been approaching both, the access to frequencies and they have potential rent sharing agreements with others. Remember is that if this is translated to a rent sharing agreement, there are also revenues, mechanisms linked to that, that we will be able to capture even though we will not -- or until now, we are not reporting that as PoPs, as was previously mentioned by Jose Manuel.
In relation to the second question, yes, this is quite interesting, specifically, in general, the fixed wireless access in Italy is a very interesting market. We have Yoigo. We have Linkem. We have also Fastweb. All those are quite active on that market, which is very much perceived as a fast-track digital device action that can be done on rural areas to provide with 3.5 gigahertz, another spectrum with broadband connection.
So it is very interesting. Of course, we are having, let's say, close discussions with all those players.

Then what happens is that at the moment that we'll start working closely with the client. We'll find the opportunity to accelerate this deployment.
So it's just -- I guess it's a combination of the densification needs of our clients. Maybe they need to have the sites ready earlier than we expected but also at the moment of announcing the deal, a prudent approach. So that's why we have been saying that our initial expectation was back-end loaded completion of these programs. So it's just mostly timing.
On your first question, short answer is no. I mean we are not seeing any -- also bear in mind that, I mean, obviously, we are working in telecom sector. We are following everything that is going on, but also our business model is quite different from that of our clients. And we are not seeing the -- basically, we are not seeing what you mentioned.

We never factorized any regulation change so far. What has been in the past also being posed. And we -- when we came into a country, we take what it is, and we want to build based on what it is.
So however, on that point, we have sometimes a mixed, let's say, feeling because when there is the possibility to raise the colocation -- the emissions, the colocation, you may expect, could also go high but also could go higher in rent sharing. Whereas because of rent sharing, as you know, there are additional carriers on the same side, so the emission being radiated is also increasing.
In the event that this is not possible, another site may be required nearby at, let's say, reasonable distance in order not to affect the radiations around the original site. So this is also generating a new demand for densification as Juan was also mentioning before.
So that's the element that we do see, and we believe all the MNOs in Italy have been already considering. So all those that we are thinking on doing rent sharing, that may be having an impact. That's possible. And they may require a physical PoP at a certain distance from the original one in the case of Italy. So the players that we're thinking of doing so, maybe that could potentially happen to them. So there will be less rent sharing, more physical points of presence. So maybe it's not that bad."

So what we are always willing is to cooperate, to find the best way in order to ensure that what the -- this project is actually looking after is best served with the minimum resources and not overspending. 
Here, we have, let's say, the Spanish government that has yet to, let's say, release the public tender proposals. And maybe the public tender will already face the situation on different ways that we may have initially envisaged with REE or the MNOs themselves have initially envisaged or even the vendors because the sources for the funding could be devoted to passive, to passive plus active or both of them or just one of them.
So what we know is, on this standby mode, proposals, as expression of interest, have been already presented to the Spanish government. I think the Spanish government has a very clear idea on what can be done or not, and that will be translated in a tender process. So hopefully, we'll be in a position to have a really cooperating project around that, and that's what we really expect to happen.
Then on the second question in relation to transportation lines. Look, we believe that this has life on its own even without recovery funds because it's a real demand. And we have started, let's say, working around that. As you know, even the sad situation of the pandemic actually happened.  Independently from the recovery fund, we expect to be in a position to, let's say, provide good news in the future around that in other areas where we are, let's say, commercially pushing for developing this type of services.
With the recovery funds, yes, it is true. You are well aware that there are also expressions of interest in relation to that. And we feel the public administration is very sensitive to the topic as well. So yes, we remain inclined to think that this is going to be an interesting path for growth for Cellnex."

We have seen around 1% of new sites being integrated coming from our build-to-suit programs. So that is also putting upwards pressure on our organic growth.
Also, as we have been mentioning before, out of this 7.5% around 3.5% is coming from pure colocation, so [indiscernible] and the additional 4%, which is linked to these 1% new sites is coming from build to suit.
So again, it's just an acceleration in the quarter of the build-to-suit efforts. But again, I mean, we are not changing the total scope for these reasons of the build-to-suit programs and then difficult to anticipate future performance. In any case, that's why we want to stick to our medium-term guidance because in terms colocation generation are in terms of the total scope of the build-to-suit programs that we have on the table.

And then the other question is just a clarification on one of your answers earlier to Nick's question around the efficiency programs. I just want to clarify, when you do approach your partners and agree to more efficiently roll out their networks, am I right in assuming you will still buy 2 separate sites through the build-to-suit program, but you will coordinate their efforts so they are based on the same physical site? Is that the way to think about those? So they're still [ 2 ] BTSs, but then you get the efficiency for the colocation."

So this is something -- this is maybe an effect that we are anticipating for 2021 only.
Other than that, let me reiterate that we are not changing the total amount of sites to be deployed. So this is just a timing effect. And of course, I mean, we haven't reached any binding agreement to go beyond what we have announced to the market. If over the course of the conversation that we are having with our clients we identified that there is an additional opportunity, of course, we will provide that information.

It's a build to suit against a legacy site that we may be having from a -- on the portfolio or could be between 2 legacy sites.
So in the case of build to suit, which, if I understand correctly, this is what you were asking for, we do not build the 2 sites and then we do movement of the 1 of the 2 sites. We avoid building one of the sites. So this means there are 2 types of savings: first of all, the ground lease of 1 of the sites; and secondly, the CapEx for building 1 of the sites. And this is the way we approach this build to suit against build-to-suit synergies. I don't know if that helps."

So there are very few handsets yet in the market. So therefore, the traffic that this 5G has to be handled, it's small enough to reduce the backhauling to the tower that was already existing before powering up one 5G.
What is clear is that, at the end, the fiber will be required because the bandwidth, when you have all the frequencies per site, will require another means of backhauling every site beyond the radio frequency link, which is what today is being used. So the market is there, but what now is being put as priority by the MNOs is just powering up 5G because it's also part of their regulatory obligations, and the backhauling will come later on."

Let me please go straight to the main highlights of the period.

Let me please go straight to the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation continues to be strong with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit programs generating a 6.5% growth. Please note that the main driver behind this strong growth in the period has been the significant contribution from our build-to-suit programs with more than 500 new sites transferred this quarter. We are also making tangible progress on our efficiencies plan, and we are on track to meet our target share with you at the beginning of the year. 
Also on the organic front, we are expanding our presence in the transport segment, and a new example is the project to provide mobile coverage in lines 16 and 17 of the Paris Metro system. The period provides again a strong set of numbers, with revenues increasing 53% compared to last year. Our adjusted EBITDA, 59%, and our recurring leverage free cash flow, 52%. We would also like to highlight the defensive profile of our revenues against interest rates potentially rising. With the majority of our contract inflation linked, we see as a natural hedge. 
And a quick comment on rising energy price. As you can see in more detail in our presentation, the vast majority of our electricity costs are protected against rising price, thanks to our pass-through mechanism and our price hedging strategies. Moving to ESG. We are making steady progress on the initiatives set out in our new ESG master plan. A couple of examples are our recent upgrade by MSCI to A from BBB. On our FTSE4Good rating improvement, which consolidates our position among the top 5 companies in the mobile sector subsector. We are also implementing creative solutions such as a zero emission rural site with combined innovation and sustainability to connect rural areas while minimizing the environmental impact. 
Moving to our capital structure strategy to fund our growth, we keep all doors open and we are constantly assessing a wide array of options to maintain our financial flexibility and to decide what is the best option at any given moment. As a reminder, we have recently issued around EUR 1.8 billion in new bonds, taking advantage of a very favorable rate environment, increasing our debt maturity and maintaining our cost of debt. Integration is crucial for the success of our growth strategy. In this sense, we are very happy with the progress made on our closing processes with some deals closed earlier than expected. 
All our integration projects are also progressing in line with our initial expectations. Let me please share with you a quick comment on the  FCA's recent decision by which the French Regulator authorizes the Hivory deal subject to the disposal of circa 3,200 rooftops to be completed over a maximum period of 30 months following the signing of the divestment agreement. We acknowledge this decision. We thank the FCA, their cooperation during this process. And we also confirm that we are already working on new opportunities related to the deployment of new core assets to invest the proceeds of this divestment with a view that both CapEx and adjusted EBITDA would remain unaffected on a consolidated run rate basis. We will try and provide more details on this as soon as we can. 
And finally, we are reiterating both our 2021 guidance and our medium-term guidance with all metrics on track. If we go to Slide #3, we are showing here, for illustrative purposes, the generation profile of our adjusted EBITDA and recurrent leverage free cash flow during 2021. As you can see, these magnitudes have been increasing every quarter as we have generated organic growth, make progress on our build-to-suit and efficiencies plan and seen the contribution from new deals as they closed. 
Our 2021 guidance implies an expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 65% and a recurrent leverage free cash flow growth of close than 60% compared to 2020.  Very quickly on the following slide, you can see the status of our ongoing integration processes and all of them are progressing as planned. Compared to the information we provided the previous quarter, you can see that we have now closed the Hivory deal in France, while we are still working as planned on our last pending closing, Hutchinson in U.K. 
If we go to Slide #5, just a quick review of our current footprint and financial targets. When all of our deals are closed and our build-to-suit programs complete, Cellnex will further strengthen its position in Europe as the main independent telecom infrastructure operator, managing a portfolio of around 130,000 sites, with presence in 12 markets, boosting our financials and becoming the industrial partner of choice for our clients. And a quick reminder of our medium-term guidance, which we are reiterating, it implies an annual growth of more than 20% in our key financial metrics since 2020 and a well-diversified expected EBITDA in 2025 of between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion. 
And if we go to Slide #6, just a few words on our last connectivity project within the transport segment. As you know, we have been awarded the connectivity project for lines 16 and 17 of the new metro transport network in Paris. We will be responsible for the design, installation and operation of the system through a neutral host model. This is our third connectivity project won in a short period of time after ProRail in the Netherlands and the London-Brighton line in the U.K. And we think there is a scope in Europe to continue providing seamless connectivity, value-added services, dedicated security communication networks and integrated management system for the transport segment using a neutral host approach. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, Jose Manuel Aisa, who will provide a few more details of the period."

Revenues have increased 55% to EUR 1,760 million. Our recurrent free cash flow has increased by 52%. Total PoPs have increased 70%, and we include a contribution from organic growth and M&A. And if we focus on organic growth only, our PoPs have increased around 6.5% compared to last year as a result of increased colocation and an acceleration of our build-to-suit program. 
Moving now to the performance in Slide #9 of our main financial metrics. On top of the figures just discussed, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 59% compared to last year, and our margin has significantly expanded. This adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly explained by the contribution from telecom infrastructure services, organic growth, build to suit, recent acquisitions and by the efficient management of our cost base. Payment of leases increased as our portfolio size increases. Maintenance CapEx is expected to converge towards our guidance, and interest paid reflects the terms of our debt structure. 
The following slide, Slide #10, explain our recurrent leverage free cash flow generation in the period. And you can see the contribution to organic growth from our different drivers, colocation and associated services, build-to-suit escalators and efficiencies. These elements combined generated EUR 86 million in the period, a 20% growth compared to last year. And if we also take the additional contribution from M&A and the rest of cash items below adjusted EBITDA, Cellnex has generated again a strong recurrent leverage free cash flow growth of 52% compared to last year. 
Moving to Slide 11, just a quick update of our lease efficiencies plan. Please note that site management has always play a key role in our operations, and we have demonstrated a strong record crystallizing efficiencies out of our portfolio of sites. Year-to-date, we have renegotiated more than 2,200 ground lease contracts, generated EUR 10 million of annualized efficiency in this year, and we are on track to meet our 2025 target. 
Moving to our balance sheet. Movements compared to last year are mainly explained by our M&A and capital structure activity in the period. The increase in total assets have a corresponding increase in equity and liabilities as a result of our last right issue and the issuance of debt instruments in the period. And just to remind that we take a prudent approach with regards to purchase price allocations in the context of our M&A activity, which prioritize allocation to fixed assets. So there you'll see in our balance sheet that's not correspond to any cash out. 
And finally, a quick update on our capital structure and liquidity position. We have around EUR 14 billion of available liquidity, including EUR 5 billion of undrawn credit lines, a strong backlog of contracted revenues at around EUR 110 billion, an average debt maturity of 7 years at a highly competitive cost of around 1.5%. No significant refinancing is expected before 2024. 88% of our debt is fixed, and our corporate debt has no covenant, no pledge, no guarantee. And with this, let's open the line for your questions."

As we expect, we will have our first anchor. So that clearly makes a huge difference. There is another difference, in France, the authority because this has been the way that we deem convenient also with the seller has cleared the transaction on Phase 1. Whereas in the U.K., we are on Phase 2. On Phase 2, you have always a much deeper assessment of the situation. And probably another element, which is quite important, is that on this first analysis done on Phase 1 by the French Authority, the -- our market relevance is as such because is not yet existing and is not considered as part of the market. So as you can imagine, when having 3 anchors in dense areas, which is basically with for instance, with whom we've been working quite a lot, that makes that percentage high. 
That was part of the rules of engagement on that deal, and we accept it as it is. And well, it's normal. It's a clear path and this is and trying to answer, Simon, the last part. This is by all means not defining a ceiling on the rest of the countries and having to move from our core assets that is the main part of our investment. In fact, the proceed that we are intending to recover from that sale, which, by the way, we are having a long time to deploy that divestment are going to be invested in core assets."

I guess just to tackle the question from a slightly different stance. I guess what I was trying to understand is, what are the specific market share limits or caps or restrictions that the French authorities were considering when they were looking at urban areas? And I guess what I'm trying to understand is when we look at other markets like, for example, Poland and Portugal, where your total pro forma market share of the towers industry is higher than what it would be in France. Was there less of an urban concentration issue in those markets? Or is it simply that the regulatory authorities in those countries didn't look at it in the same way they do in France? So that's my first question. 
The second one, I guess, is linked to the last answer you just gave with regards to orange not being considered and I mean, sorry, specifically, not being considered in the way that the authorities are looking at the industry. And I guess you flagged a similar issue with the CMA in the U.K. where Cornerstone is also not being considered. Can you maybe also understand why the regulatory authorities in these countries are not including these telco and towers when they're equally renting sites to third parties? So what is the difference? Why do they differentiate in that way and not consider those players? That's the second one. 
And the third one is just linking to some comments you made in the introductory comments around interest rates and inflation. Obviously, I understand your comments around inflation protection that you have in your contracts. I just wondered if you could remind us, though, of what you've assumed within your 2025 guidance because where we are today in the sort of inflation volatility we're seeing is probably quite different from what you said in your guidance. So maybe if you can just help us understand what you embedded just so we can better understand that if inflation were to stay high for longer, whether that would or would not cause a deviation to your guidance?"

And I think that, that will be one of the elements that could take us to one part of the range or to the other. But when we present long term, we plan to run the model, not only under one scenario. It's multiple scenarios, especially regarding macroeconomics and taking into account. When we did this exercise that it was true that inflation was not there. But macroeconomy is a GDP, it was less. How long this inflation is going to last? If you look at right now, the different European -- well, the sources is quite a good spread of opinion.

We are extremely respectful on any authority decisions on that. And in that sense, we cannot do anything else than just follow because it's part of the game, but the question is interesting.  First of all, you may have 2 jurisdictions, which is either member stage jurisdiction or European level jurisdiction. And you file depending of certain parameters, either on the local jurisdiction or the European jurisdiction. When you go to the local jurisdiction, interestingly, the way that the market is assessed is different from country to country, but also may be different in the same country from file to file, and we experience that as well. 
So sometimes the authority is looking overlap of towers. Sometimes it's looking other type of potential elements that could lessen the competition. So every file is a case, and I would not be now in a position, I think neither no one in our company to say from that percentage onwards we have an issue because percentage of what and how this is measured. In France, they decided to separate rural Well, it's a one way to do it. So methodologies not necessarily have to be the same everywhere, and this is what we are seeing since we've been facing several competition approvals on the last transactions. 
And  on your second question on why this control tower companies are not considered as part of the market? Well, precisely for that reason that being the shareholder, the client, there is -- well, the potential thinking that those companies will not be as eager as sellers would be in trying to capture the market, and there will be more focused on just serving the interest of the shareholder. Well, actually, the way that those companies have been expressing their selves, their intentions are not exactly like that. So when we listen to them, we listen an equity story, not very far from Cellnex. So there is interest on capturing growth. And when we listen to CTIL, it's not very dissimilar. 
So well, there is not much more that we can say other than respected decisions coming out from the authorities, even though our opinion probably is different. And going back to France, well, that transaction, remember, is, again, 3 anchors. We would like to have 3 anchors in other jurisdictions, north of 25,000 sites, plus a lot of them yet to be deployed in rural areas. So in that sense, I think we are in an interesting position to roll out our business in France."

And then second question was just on, again, on inflation. You've obviously shown us that Cellnex has inflation badge. But obviously, a lot of your customers don't and we've had some more negative commentary around inflation from operators over the last few days. So the question is, are you noticing any change in behavior in willingness to speed up your build-to-suit programs to get them off balance sheet or go after fiber-to-the-tower programs and contracts with you so that operators can get those costs off their balance sheets and those inflation risks of their balance sheet?"

These entities managing these transport networks, metro systems, now they have to provide more connectivity. They have an incentive to actually to make the customer happier and they are growing more and more interested in selling this type of auction processes to provide this connectivity and we are participating in these processes. 
We have been successful in 3 of them. And I guess that going forward, every channel we learned that there is a new opportunity.

The first is related to the numbers you released and the second in the strategy. So one of the numbers, I congratulate here because, basically, it's another steady growth on organic delivered free cash flow. I looked into the main drivers, and I can see that the keeping the good momentum. And all the doubt is coming from efficiency and synergies. Then I looked on Slide 11, and you provided an update of the lease optimization strategy. It looks like you increased a number of the targets. I'm talking about the for year-end. You got 2.8 from 2.4 last quarter.  
You also look to have increased annual efficiencies for full year '22 and '23. However, you have maintained a target of EUR 90 million to EUR 110 million by 2025. So the question is the fact that you increased the medium target is the fact that it's a just fast execution? Or you've just taken a caution approach and you expect to increase further before you upgrade your long-term target? 
The second one is on strategy. Now since covering Cellnex from 2015 and the IPO, the last 6 months has been one of the quietest time in terms of deal making. I guess, time has been spent more on integration of the past deals. And of course, all the questions we've seen so far on the call on the antitrust processes for the deal that were not completed. A question is a bit more on the strategy you announced earlier this year, the large that was announced with the acquisition of the from Polkomtel. 
I was wondering if you can provide a bit of an update there because, I guess, you were pretty vocal on the fact that this will open a new market to you guys. So I guess over the last 6 to 9 months, you've been active looking for on talking to operators. So my question is how many operators have been willing to sell active equipment to you or to anyone else or to turn active sharing agreements into client supply relationships? 
And on the Polkomtel deal per se, now the deal has completed. I think, it was completed in July. I was wondering if you can provide a bit of color is going to work in terms of the risk for future CapEx cycles? So our revenues on the contract will be adjusted upwards if in any time Cellnex to upgrade the equipment starting from the 5G or that risk now remain with Cellnex?"

So after, let's say, already being hands on the asset, we are confirming what we were expecting. So any CapEx will come alongside with an additional revenue. In relation on how ready we are to start deploying that massively? I would refer you to Page #4, where you have the level of integration. And when you look at Polkomtel, which is the third column from the right, you see that on taking control, we are just declaring a 17% and on full integration plan because we have deployed our industrial model only 3%. 
So we need to -- and this means that our systems are ready to handle the whole new level of operations that we are supposed to handle.

To entertain discussions, people is calling us. That's interesting. Why don't you explain me and how is it working? 
So this is the type of interactions now we are having. And as you can imagine, the sales cycle for this type of activity, it's a long one because you are facing previous on rent-sharing agreements that maybe the operators were already having, how this has to be tackled? Vendor swaps because there are certain vendors that have to be replaced. There is a set of elements of complexity that we love them because we feel that we are the right partner for this type of industrial complex elements.

So at the beginning, everyone was having their own active, their own passive after they started to share the passive among MNOs, okay? At the moment, they share passive. They question themselves, well, and this is what we were questioning them when we were trying to develop that market in Europe. Where is the competitive advantage if you are already sharing the passive? Sell the asset, okay? And well, this has actually crystallized and is happening all over in Europe. 
And look at the active, how many agreements are and not only in rural also in dense areas? By the way, 5G is massively share. So at the moment that you are sharing something that potentially could be as competitive as having 5G, you can question exactly  -- you can pose the same question as we were making a few years ago on the passive, if you are sharing it, where is the competitive advantage? And this is when the next wave, we believe, may be triggered. So not becoming a competitive advantage because you are already sharing the active by means of line sharing. 
So  on the top of that, there is a technological evolution that may be also helping for all this to happen, which is Open Run. When you think of how the radio access network equipment may be evolving, which is equipment which is actually installed in our sites, this is going to be a commodity. As of today, you are having an equipment from one vendor or the other vendor, and they are not compatible. What Open Run is going to allow is actually to make those equipments commodities, and therefore, lowering the barriers for mutualizing all of them. 
So we foresee a trend in this direction. Is this going to be as big as the passive? No. And I think when we announce the deal, we compare a little bit the CapEx being devoted for the active equipment versus the CapEx that we devote for the acquisition of a passive infrastructure. So there is not an order of magnitude on CapEx, but easily 5x difference on how much is the equipment cost versus how much we pay for a tower. So that is going to give you a clear idea that never this is going to be as big as the passive has been."

The second question is on just a bit the following up from the Open Run discussion, and that's very helpful. I see in your slides that you basically say that given the antennas and radio transmitters will still have to be placed on towers. There is no change to your business model. But I presume that with Open Run, those antennas and transmitters will also be lighter and smaller. So will that represent a threat to your ability to keep rents where they are?

So your question is referring the acquisition of land from in which our sites are there? This is set up. This is defined within this EUR 86 million that we have invested EUR 38 million until today in the first 9 months. As we are suggesting here, our payback is more or less of 10%. So if you consider that we do this EUR 38 million step by step throughout the year, and you can see that our payback of 10 years or 10% to make it very simple that can give you a figure, which is next to EUR 2 million, okay? But be careful. 
This EUR 2 million is for the 2 kinds of acquisition of land, one can be to acquire our online, which is what you are suggesting, and can the acquisition of land on third parties, then it should be our revenue. But all in all, this is within the EUR 86 million, both kind of acquisitions within EUR 86 million, okay? 
And the second question was pressure on employees. Look, in general, and correct me, if I'm wrong. I think that Cellnex has 2 kind of employees those follow  and follows agreement and those that do not follow the bargaining agreement. So in -- I think that the agreement was set up with some elements that tend to be linked to inflation in that case. And those who are not under bargaining agreement, so it's more a case-by-case basis, and it depends. So again, the answer to this question is a little bit more as we will follow your -- the inflation. 
Please be aware of something. This company has changed significantly, and this is again in Slide #10, the change of perimeter significantly. Obviously, labor is going to grow. For instance, in Poland, we have more people than before. This -- the change in this item of employees will be driven by change of perimeter, not by inflation. So the main driver is the perimeter. Inflation is important, but it's not a key driver at all. I would say to to be not significant."

So I just wanted to maybe get an idea of how we should expect this to evolve in the coming quarters, whether some of these outflows we are seeing beyond build to suit will remain in place or whether some of them may reverse? 
And my second question is around your priorities around capital structure as you continue to expand. I think when after lease view, more or less, your net debt to EBITDA is around 7 to 7.5x, which is significantly higher than our competitors. As I mentioned earlier, it's still rising. You have some minorities, and you've pledged to the market that you may do EUR 9 billion of acquisitions without raising equity. I'm curious whether that is a firm plan or whether there are conditions under which you may decide to either not make the EUR 9 billion acquisitions or use equity a bit earlier, so you do not exceed certain metrics?"

Let me go step by step because you are raising many questions and this is very important. In terms of leverage position and you talk about net debt to EBITDA evolution and all these kind of things, let me recall you that when talking about credit quality, it's important not only to be focused on a ratio, which is important, but also please taking into account the business risk profile of Cellnex and also what rating agencies say about us. All this information is not only for the equity holder as for the bondholders. And therefore, everything that we have been doing this year, which is to meet the business plan and to meet the payments of M&A and to meet the payments of the build-to-suit program is public information. We cannot change it. And we present this rating agencies and ratings agencies give us the current corporate rating. 
So so far so good. It is true that we can have a peak 1 year, then we will deliver the following, which is important here. And I think that we must not miss the point is the backlog generates cash flow. So net EBITDA should be taken into account in 2021, in 2023, 2025. So this is the key question. But please consider other elements, qualitative elements that also mitigate what can be perceived as a high number. If you don't do so, you can maybe reach 2 points that somehow are not -- cannot be validated by our capital structure. Yes, yes, please. Let's go to -- in order to answer 2 slides. Let's go to Slide #13. 
In Slide #13, you can see here the financial structure. And you know it as well is -- I mean we have a very competitive cost, which is 1.5%, is not hedged, is no pledged, is no covenant. If someone gives Cellnex all this capacity, all this profile of maturities in the future is because somehow do not fully agree with your question. Somehow perceive that Cellnex generates significant cash flow in the future in order to meet all the maturities. This is a key point. So fine. Net debt to EBITDA is important, yes, but what is really important is the cash flow generation of Cellnex in a commensurated way with the maturities and also with the structure of the debt. When you raised the question, you forget -- you are many credit 
And finally, in Slide 20, and I think that this is a slide which is not new at all, and we have put it several times before, but we reimplemented. We're telling you that Cellnex has always been able to define a key flexibility in the financing. Key flexibility that gives us capacity to postpone M&A payments to build-to-suit product and to meet the profitability of our build-to-suit program with just what we pay for the build to suit does not make sense. You have to understand that the build-to-suit for us is a way of funding this company. This is how we've been from the very beginning not from now. 
And you have seen how Cellnex has been able to maintain this net debt EBITDA more or less in the previous year and invest investments So why to change what has been working so far. If you take the processes that we have done in the past, and you project in the future, you will find this EUR 9 billion. If you only focus on the net debt to EBITDA in the short term, obviously, I understand your question. Please look at Slide #20 and #13 and we can take it offline and to help you to understand the credit quality of Cellnex."

I would like also to remind that in the second Polish transaction, there is type of asset very similar to the one that we have with Wix. So you have all the fiber connecting the central offices, metropolitan offices with the towers. So  in that case, we have acquired and are already an existing base of fiber to the tower that will require to be affected 2 more towers as well. But it's not only it's also  with Polkomtel that we are having an important fiber-to-the-tower infrastructure. 
Then how this conversion because, actually, here, we are converting from radio links to fiber because, historically, if there was no fiber, it's because there was radio link. So the radio link, as we've been also discussing in the past, today capacity is quite high. However, when you are adding 5G on a site, probably that radio link needs to be replaced by fiber. So the growth that we expect on fiber to the tower deployed by ourselves or deployed by our clients to our towers, which is also something which is possible, will be very much linked to the -- not only the deployment but also the actual usage of 5G because you may deploy 5G. But if there are no cell phones actually capable to connect to the 5G, then the demand of additional data is not there. So there is no need to replace that radio link. So that will be very much in line and in parallel with 5G data usage in the coming years."

We can say to someone you can buy this stake. Maybe we do have all the right or the optionability open, we have done it, and we will continue doing and we can swap also. 
In fact, for instance, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partner was in Switzerland and today in the Netherlands. So there has been somehow a swap through other transactions, but we have been able to show this flexibility, which is key in our net debt -- in our credit quality structure. Then you raised the point about net debt to EBITDA, is there are minorities? If there are partners, as it is happening, for instance, in Switzerland, just to take Netherlands, there is a ring-fenced financing. Ring-fenced financing somehow has this characteristic that maximize the level of the debt in the different companies without having an impact on the corporate rating of Cellnex. 
And this is called subordination. Obviously, for us -- for me, in my view, as a CFO of this company, subordination is a red line that I will never cross. And so in this case, Fernando, I think the answer is a little half more angle than only a net debt-to-EBITDA calculation. There are clear rules of subordination, clear rules of refinancing of the debt at the level of of the countries and also the partners that we can also to take into account. If you put all these things together, as always have been on the table, give us  the flexibility that we require in order to fund the next round of M&A. And I think..."

Let me please go straight to the main highlights of the period.

Let me please go straight to the main highlights of the period. Our organic growth generation continues to be strong with new PoPs on existing sites and our build-to-suit programs generating a 6.5% growth. Please note that the main driver behind this strong growth in the period has been the significant contribution from our build-to-suit programs with more than 500 new sites transferred this quarter. We are also making tangible progress on our efficiencies plan, and we are on track to meet our target shared with you at the beginning of the year. 
Also on the organic front, we are expanding our presence in the transport segment, and a new example is the project to provide mobile coverage in lines 16 and 17 of the Paris Metro system. The period provides again a strong set of numbers, with revenues increasing 53% compared to last year. Our adjusted EBITDA, 59%, and our recurring leveraged free cash flow, 52%. We would also like to highlight the defensive profile of our revenues against interest rates potentially rising. With the majority of our contract inflation linked, we see as a natural hedge. 
And a quick comment on rising energies price. As you can see in more detail in our presentation, the vast majority of our electricity costs are protected against rising price, thanks to our pass-through mechanism and our price hedging strategies. 
Moving to ESG. We are making steady progress on the initiatives set out in our new ESG master plan. A couple of examples are our recent upgrade by MSCI to A from BBB on our FTSE4Good rating improvement, which consolidates our position among the top 5 companies in the mobile sector subsector. We are also implementing creative solutions such as a Zero Emissions Rural Site with combined innovation and sustainability to connect rural areas while minimizing the environmental impact. 
Moving to our capital structure strategy to fund our growth. We keep all doors open and we are constantly assessing a wide array of options to maintain our financial flexibility and to decide what is the best option at any given moment. As a reminder, we have recently issued around EUR 1.8 billion in new bonds, taking advantage of a very favorable rate environment, increasing our debt maturity and maintaining our cost of debt. Integration is crucial for the success of our growth strategy. In this sense, we are very happy with the progress made on our closing processes with some deals closed earlier than expected. 
All our integration projects are also progressing in line with our initial expectations. Let me please share with you a quick comment on the  FCA's recent decision by which the French regulator authorizes the Hivory deal subject to the disposal of circa 3,200 rooftops to be completed over a maximum period of 30 months following the signing of the divestment agreement. 
We acknowledge this decision. We thank the FCA, their cooperation during this process. And we also confirm that we are already working on new opportunities related to the deployment of new core assets to invest the proceeds of this divestment with a view that both CapEx and adjusted EBITDA would remain unaffected on a consolidated run rate basis. We will try and provide more details on this as soon as we can.  And finally, we are reiterating both our 2021 guidance and our medium-term guidance with all metrics on track. 
If we go to Slide #3, we are showing here, for illustrative purposes, the generation profile of our adjusted EBITDA and recurring leveraged free cash flow during 2021. As you can see, these magnitudes have been increasing every quarter as we have generated organic growth, made progress on our build-to-suit and efficiencies plan and seen the contribution from new deals as they closed. 
Our 2021 guidance implies an expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 65% and a recurring leveraged free cash flow growth of close than 60% compared to 2020.  Very quickly on the following slide, you can see the status of our ongoing integration processes and all of them are progressing as planned. Compared to the information we provided the previous quarter, you can see that we have now closed the Hivory deal in France, while we are still working as planned on our last pending closing, Hutchison in U.K. 
If we go to Slide #5, just a quick review of our current footprint and financial targets. When all of our deals are closed and our build-to-suit programs complete, Cellnex will further strengthen its position in Europe as the main independent telecom infrastructure operator, managing a portfolio of around 130,000 sites, with presence in 12 markets, boosting our financials and becoming the industrial partner of choice for our clients. And a quick reminder of our medium-term guidance, which we are reiterating, it implies an annual growth of more than 20% in our key financial metrics since 2020 and a well-diversified expected EBITDA in 2025 of between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion. 
And if we go to Slide #6, just a few words on our last connectivity project within the transport segment. As you know, we have been awarded the connectivity project for lines 16 and 17 of the new metro transport network in Paris. We will be responsible for the design, installation and operation of the system through a neutral host model. This is our third connectivity project won in a short period of time after ProRail in the Netherlands and the London-Brighton line in the U.K. And we think there is a scope in Europe to continue providing seamless connectivity, value-added services, dedicated security communication networks and integrated management system for the transport segment using a neutral host approach. 
And with this, I will now hand over to our CFO, Jose Manuel Aisa, who will provide a few more details of the period."

Revenues have increased 55% to EUR 1,760 million. Our recurring free cash flow has increased by 52%. Total PoPs have increased 70%, and we include the contribution from organic growth and M&A. And if we focus on organic growth only, our PoPs have increased around 6.5% compared to last year as a result of increased co-location and an acceleration of our build-to-suit program. 
Moving now to the performance in Slide #9 of our main financial metrics. On top of the figures just discussed, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 59% compared to last year, and our margin has significantly expanded. This adjusted EBITDA growth is mainly explained by the contribution from telecom infrastructure services, organic growth, build to suit, recent acquisitions and by the efficient management of our cost base. Payment of leases increase as our portfolio size increases. Maintenance CapEx is expected to converge towards our guidance, and interest paid reflects the terms of our debt structure. 
The following slide, Slide #10, explain our recurring leveraged free cash flow generation in the period. And you can see the contribution to organic growth from our different drivers, co-location and associated services, build-to-suit escalators and efficiencies. These elements combined generated EUR 86 million in the period, a 20% growth compared to last year. And if we also take the additional contribution from M&A and the rest of cash items below adjusted EBITDA, Cellnex has generated again a strong recurring leveraged free cash flow growth of 52% compared to last year. 
Moving to Slide 11, just a quick update of our lease efficiencies plan. Please note that site management has always played a key role in our operations, and we have demonstrated a strong record crystallizing efficiencies out of our portfolio of sites. Year-to-date, we have renegotiated more than 2,200 ground lease contracts, generated EUR 10 million of annualized efficiencies in this year, and we are on track to meet our 2025 target.
Moving to our balance sheet. Movements compared to last year are mainly explained by our M&A and capital structure activity in the period. The increase in total assets has sustained a corresponding increase in equity and liabilities as a result of our last right issue and the issuance of debt instruments in the period. And just to remind that we take a prudent approach with regards to purchase price allocations in the context of our M&A activity, which prioritize allocation to fixed assets. So the goodwill you see in our balance sheet does not correspond to any cash-out. 
And finally, a quick update on our capital structure and liquidity position. We have around EUR 14 billion of available liquidity, including EUR 5 billion of undrawn credit lines, a strong backlog of contracted revenues at around EUR 110 billion, an average debt maturity of 7 years at a highly competitive cost of around 1.5%. No significant refinancing is expected before 2024. 88% of our debt is fixed, and our corporate debt has no covenant, no pledge, no guarantee. And with this, let's open the line for your questions."

Or is it still you want to go for passive or active wherever there are opportunities?

So basically, this remedies agreement that we have reached is just a solution to this specific constraint. There is nothing else. 
On the second question, these are completely unrelated processes. So you know that we have a vast experience dealing with antitrust authorities across Europe. We are present in 12 countries. I would say that we are comfortable with the understanding of the different antitrust authorities of our business model. So again, in France, there was a specific issue that we needed to solve. Thanks to this agreement. In the CMA process in the U.K., it's following its path. You know that everything is going on track. But again, we see those as complete separate processes."

So in the case of the France, we are talking about having 3 anchors and that clearly makes a difference. In the case of the U.K., at the moment, we closed the transactions. As we expect, we will have our first anchor. So that clearly makes a huge difference. There is another difference. In France, the authority, because this has been the way that we deem convenient also with the seller, has cleared the transaction on Phase 1. Whereas in the U.K., we are on Phase 2. On Phase 2, you have always a much deeper assessment of the situation. And probably another element, which is quite important, is that on this first analysis done on Phase 1 by the French authority, the -- our market relevance is as such because Totem is not yet existing and is not considered as part of the market. So as you can imagine, when having 3 anchors in dense areas, which is basically with Bouygues for instance, with whom we've been working quite a lot, that makes that percentage high. 
That was part of the rules of engagement on that deal, and we accept it as it is. And it's normal. It's a clear path. And by all means, this is -- I'm trying to answer, Simon, the last part. This is by all means not defining a ceiling on the rest of the countries and having to move from our core assets that is the main part of our investment. In fact, the proceeds that we are intending to recover from that sale, which, by the way, we are having a long time to deploy that divestment, are going to be invested in core assets."

But so you know that we are being quite active in the area of tower-adjacent assets. So to add layers of revenues and contracts and additional services to the existing cooperation that we already have with our anchor tenants.

I guess just to tackle the question from a slightly different stance. I guess what I was trying to understand is, what are the specific market share limits or caps or restrictions that the French authorities were considering when they were looking at urban areas? And I guess what I'm trying to understand is when we look at other markets like, for example, Poland and Portugal, where your total pro forma market share of the towers industry is higher than what it would be in France, was there less of an urban concentration issue in those markets? Or is it simply that the regulatory authorities in those countries didn't look at it in the same way they do in France? So that's my first question. 
The second one, I guess, is linked to the last answer you just gave with regards to Orange not being considered -- and Totem, I mean, sorry, specifically, not being considered in the way that the authorities are looking at the industry. And I guess you flagged a similar issue with the CMA in the U.K. where Cornerstone is also not being considered. Can you maybe also understand why the regulatory authorities in these countries are not including these telco and towers when they're equally renting sites to third parties? So what is the difference? Why do they differentiate in that way and not consider those players? That's the second one. 
And the third one is just linking to some comments you made in the introductory comments around interest rates and inflation. Obviously, I understand your comments around inflation protection that you have in your contracts. I just wondered if you could remind us, though, of what you've assumed within your 2025 guidance because where we are today in the sort of inflation volatility we're seeing is probably quite different from what you said in your guidance. So maybe if you can just help us understand what you embedded just so we can better understand that if inflation were to stay high for longer, whether that would or would not cause a deviation to your guidance."

So first of all, you may have 2 jurisdictions, which is either member stage jurisdiction or European level jurisdiction. And you file depending of certain parameters, either on the local jurisdiction or the European jurisdiction. When you go to the local jurisdiction, interestingly, the way that the market is assessed is different from country to country but also may be different in the same country from file to file, and we experience that as well. 
So sometimes, the authority is looking overlap of towers. Sometimes, it's looking other type of potential elements that could lessen the competition. So every file is a case, and I would not be now in a position, I think, neither -- no one in our company to say from that percentage onwards, we have an issue because percentage of what and how this is measured, in France, they decided to separate rural than these areas. Well, it's a one way to do it. So methodologies not necessarily have to be the same everywhere, and this is what we are seeing since we've been facing several competition approvals on the last transactions. 
And then on your second question on why this control tower companies are not considered as part of the market. Well, it's precisely for that reason that being the shareholder, the client, there is -- well, the potential thinking that those companies will not be as eager as sellers would be in trying to capture the market. And they will be more focused on just serving the interest of the shareholder. Well, actually, the way that those companies have been expressing themselves, their intentions, are not exactly like that. So when we listen, Totem will listen an equity story, not very far from Cellnex. So there is interest on capturing growth. And when we listen to CTIL, it's not very dissimilar. 
So well, there is not much more that we can say other than respect the decisions coming out from the authorities, even though our opinion probably is different. And going back to France, well, that transaction, remember, is again 3 anchors. We would like to have 3 anchors in other jurisdictions, north of 25,000 sites, plus build-to-suits, a lot of them yet to be deployed in rural areas. So in that sense, I think we are in an interesting position to roll out our business in France."

And then second question was just on, again, on inflation. You've obviously shown us that Cellnex has an I-love-inflation badge. But obviously, a lot of your customers don't, and we've had some more negative commentary around inflation from operators over the last few days. So the question is, are you noticing any change in behavior in willingness to speed up your build-to-suit programs to get them off balance sheet or go after fiber-to-the-tower programs and contracts with you, so that operators can get those costs off their balance sheets and those inflation risks off their balance sheet?"

These entities managing these transport networks, metro systems, now they have an incentive to provide more connectivity. They have an incentive to actually to make the customer happier. And they are growing more and more interested in selling this type of auction processes to provide this connectivity and we are participating in these processes. 
We have been successful in 3 of them. And I guess that going forward, every channel we learn that there is a new opportunity where the neutral host model makes sense, we will continue participating.

The first is related to the numbers you released and the second in the strategy. So one of the numbers, I congratulate you because, basically, it's another steady growth on organic levered free cash flow. I looked into the main drivers, and I can see that the call on the BTS are keeping a good momentum. And all the doubt is coming from efficiency and synergies. Then I looked on Slide 11, and you provided an update of the lease optimization strategy. It looks like you increased a number of the targets. I'm talking about the site action for year-end. You go to 2,800 from 2,400 last quarter.  
You also look to have increased the annual efficiencies for full year '22 and '23. However, you have maintained a target of EUR 90 million to EUR 110 million by 2025. So the question is the fact that you increased the medium targets, is the fact that it's just fast execution? Or you're just taken a cautioned approach and you expect to increase further before you upgrade your long-term target? 
The second one is on strategy. Now since covering Cellnex from 2015 and the IPO, the last 6 months has been one of the quietest time in terms of deal making. I guess, time has been spent more on integration of the past deals. And of course, all the questions we've seen so far on the call on the antitrust processes for the deal that have not completed. My question is a bit more on the other strategy you announced earlier this year, the enlarged TowerCo, that was announced with the acquisition of the TowerCos from Polkomtel. 
I was wondering if you can provide a bit of an update there because, I guess, you were pretty vocal on the fact that this will open a new market to you guys. So I guess over the last 6 to 9 months, you've been active looking for or talking to operators. So my question is how many operators have been willing to sell active equipment to you or to anyone else or to turn active sharing agreements into client supply relationships? 
And on the Polkomtel deal per se, now the deal has completed. I think, it was completed in July. I was wondering if you can provide a bit of color how it's going to work in terms of the risk for future CapEx cycles. So revenues on the contract will be adjusted upwards if in any time Cellnex is to upgrade the equipment starting from the 5G, or that risk now remain with Cellnex?"

So after, let's say, already being hands-on on the asset, we are confirming what we were expecting. So any CapEx will come alongside with an additional revenue. In relation on how ready we are to start deploying that massively, I would refer you to Page #4 where you have the level of integration. And when you look at Polkomtel, which is the third column from the right, you see that on taking control, we are just declaring a 17% and on full integration plan, because we have deployed our industrial model, only 3%. 
So we need to -- and this means that our systems are ready to handle the whole new level of operations that we are supposed to handle. We are here delivering carriers, not delivering a space in a mass. So as you can imagine, that is having an impact on, for instance, invoicing. So before we going massively to the rest of our potential prospects on trying to transact this type of new activity, we are, as you can imagine, prudent, which is not preventing for us as we already mentioned in the past to entertain discussions. Well, it's calling us. That's interesting. Why don't you explain me and how is it working? 
So this is the type of interactions now we are having. And as you can imagine, the sales cycle for this type of activity, it's a long one because you are facing previous rent-sharing agreements that maybe the operators were already having. How this has to be tackled? Vendor swaps because there are certain vendors that have to be replaced. There is a set of elements of complexity that we love them because we feel that we are the right partner for this type of industrial complex elements. But it's going to take time as we have already indicated at the very beginning."

So at the beginning, everyone was having their own active, their own passive. After they started to share the passive among MNOs, okay, at the moment they share passive, they question themselves, well -- and this is what we were questioning them when we were trying to develop that market in Europe, where is the competitive advantage if you are already sharing the passive? Sell the asset, okay? And well, this has actually crystallized and is happening all over in Europe. 
And look at the active. How many rent-sharing agreements there are? And not only in rural, also in dense areas? By the way, 5G is massively shared. So at the moment that you are sharing something that potentially could be as competitive as having 5G, you can question exactly -- you can pose the same question as we were making a few years ago on the passive. If you are sharing it, where is the competitive advantage? And this is when the next wave, we believe, may be triggered. So not becoming a competitive advantage because you are already sharing the active by means of rent sharing. 
So on the top of that, there is a technological evolution that may be also helping for all this to happen, which is Open RAN. When you think of how the radio access network equipment may be evolving, which is equipment which is actually installed in our sites, this is going to be a commodity. As of today, you are having an equipment from one vendor or the other vendor, and they are not compatible. What Open RAN is going to allow is actually to make those equipments commodities, and therefore, lowering the barriers for mutualizing all of them.  So we foresee a trend in this direction. 
Is this going to be as big as the passive? No. And I think when we announced the deal, we compare a little bit the CapEx being devoted for the active equipment versus the CapEx that we devote for the acquisition of a passive infrastructure. So there is not an order of magnitude on CapEx, but easily 5x difference on how much is the equipment cost versus how much we pay for a tower. So that is going to give you a clear idea that never this is going to be as big as the passive has been."

The second question is on -- just a bit the following up from your Open RAN discussion, and thanks, that's very helpful. I see in your slides that you basically say that given that antennas and radio transmitters will still have to be placed on towers, there is no change to your business model. But I presume that with Open RAN, those antennas and transmitters will also be lighter and smaller. So will that represent a threat to your ability to keep rents where they are? And finally, just a read across question because we are seeing in Asia, particularly in China, the chip shortage is leading to a slowdown in 5G base stations deployment. And I'm wondering if you are seeing any evidence of that also in Europe and in your markets."

So your question is referring the acquisition of land from in which our sites are there. This is set up. This is defined within this EUR 86 million. You know that we have invested EUR 38 million until today in the first 9 months. As we are suggesting here, our payback is more or less a tier of 10%. So if you consider that we do this EUR 38 million step by step throughout the year and you can see that our payback of 10 years or 10%, to make it very simple, the EUR 38 million divided by -- that can give you a figure which is next to EUR 2 million, okay? But be careful. 
This EUR 2 million is for the 2 kinds of acquisition of land, one can be to acquire our own land, which is what you are suggesting. It can be acquisition of land of third parties. Then, it should be our revenue. But all in all, this is within the EUR 86 million, both kind of acquisitions within EUR 86 million, okay? 
And the second question was pressure on employees. Looking in general and correct me if I'm wrong, I think that Cellnex does have 2 kind of employees, those that follow and follow the bargaining agreement and those that do not follow the bargaining agreement. So in -- I think that the bargaining agreement was set up with some elements that tend to be linked to inflation in that case. And those who are not under bargaining agreement, so it's more a case-by-case basis, and it depends. So again, the answer to this question is a little bit more as simple as saying, we will follow your -- the inflation. 
Please be aware of something. This company has changed significantly, and this is again in Slide #10, the change of perimeter significantly. Obviously, labor is going to grow. For instance, in Poland, we have more people than before. This -- the change in this item of employees will be driven by change of perimeter, not by inflation. So the main driver is the perimeter. Inflation is important, but it's not a key driver at all. I would say to you, it tends to be not significant."

On an after-lease perspective, in the last 6 months, it's up more than EUR 1 billion. So I just wanted to maybe get an idea of how we should expect this to evolve in the coming quarters, whether some of these outflows we are seeing beyond build-to-suit will remain in place or whether some of them may reverse? 
And my second question is around your priorities around capital structure as you continue to expand. I think on an after-lease view, more or less, your net debt to EBITDA is around 7 to 7.5x, which is significantly higher than your competitors. As I mentioned earlier, it's still rising. You have some minorities, and you've pledged to the market that you may do EUR 9 billion of acquisitions without raising equity. I'm curious whether that is a firm plan or whether there are conditions under which you may decide to either not make the EUR 9 billion acquisitions or use equity a bit earlier, so you do not exceed certain metrics."

Let me go step by step because you are raising many questions, and this is very important. In terms of leverage position and you talk about net debt to EBITDA evolution and all these kind of things, let me recall you that when talking about credit quality, it's important not only to be focused on a ratio, which is important. But also, please take into account the business risk profile of Cellnex and also what rating agencies say about us. All this information is not only for the equity holders, also for the bondholders. And therefore, everything that we have been doing this year, which is to meet the business plan and to meet the payments of the M&A and to meet the payments of the build-to-suit program, is public information. We cannot change it. And we present this to rating agencies and rating agencies give us the current corporate rating.  So, so far so good. 
It is true that we can have a peak 1 year, then we will deliver the following, which is important here. And I think that we must not miss the point is the backlog generates cash flow. So net EBITDA should be taken into account in 2021, in 2023, 2025. So this is the key question. But please consider other elements, qualitative elements that also mitigate what can be perceived as a high number. If you don't do so, you can maybe reach 2 points that somehow, we are not -- cannot be validated by our capital structure. Yes, yes, please. Let's go to -- in order to answer, I need 2 slides. Let's go to Slide #13. 
In Slide #13, you can see here the financial structure. And you know it as well is -- I mean we have a very competitive cost, which is 1.5%, is not hedged, is no pledges, no covenant. If someone gives Cellnex all this capacity, all this profile of maturities in the future, it is because somehow do not fully agree with your question. Somehow, also perceive that Cellnex generates significant cash flow in the future in order to meet all the maturities. This is a key point. So fine. 
Net debt to EBITDA is important, yes, but what is really important is the cash flow generation of Cellnex in a commensurated way with the maturities and also with the structure of the debt. When you raised the question, you forget -- you are forgetting many credit factors.
And finally, in Slide 20, and I think that this is a [ for ] digital slide which is not new at all. And we have put it several times before, but we reimplement it. We're telling you that Cellnex has always been able to define a key flexibility in the financing, key flexibility that give us capacity to postpone M&A payments to build-to-suit product and to meet the profitability of our build-to-suit program. With just what we pay for the build-to-suit does not make sense. You have to understand that the build-to-suit for us is a way of funding this company. This has always been from the very beginning, Georgios, not from now. 
And you have seen how Cellnex has been able to maintain this net debt EBITDA more or less in the previous year and invest on committed investment systems. So why do change what has been working so far? If you take the processes that we have done in the past and you project in the future, you will find this EUR 9 billion. If you only focus on the net debt to EBITDA in the short term, obviously, I understand your question. Please look at Slide 20 and 13, and we can take it offline and to help you to understand the credit quality of Cellnex."

I mean, we are not just discussing plain vanilla deals. Densification and other potential solutions for mobile operators are playing a role. And I guess that extends somehow the conversations that we are having, so nothing has really changed.

I would like also to remind that in the second Polish transaction, there is a type of asset very similar to the one that we have with Bouygues. So you have all the fiber connecting the central offices, metropolitan offices with the towers. So in that case, we have acquired an already an existing base of fiber-to-the-tower that will require to be updated 2 more towers as well. But it's not only Bouygues.  It's also the -- with Polkomtel that we are having an important fiber-to-the-tower infrastructure. 
Then how this conversion? Because actually here, we are converting from radio links to fiber. Because historically, if there was no fiber, it's because there was a radio link. So the radio link, as we've been also discussing in the past, today's capacity is quite high. However, when you are adding 5G on a site, probably that radio link needs to be replaced by fiber. 
So the growth that we expect on fiber-to-the-tower deployed by ourselves or deployed by our clients to our towers, which is also something which is possible, will be very much linked to the -- not only the deployment but also the actual usage of 5G. Because you may deploy 5G, but if there are no cell phones actually capable to connect to the 5G, then this demand of additional data is not there. So there is no need to replace that radio link. So that will be very much in line and in parallel with the 5G data usage in the coming years."

And second, based on the maturity of our teams in the ground because as you can imagine, in those countries where we have just landed our focus, first of all, on establishing and stabilizing the operations, making sure that with the acquisition, we are not creating any quality issues to our clients. 
But as Franco was saying, when we are already settled like, for instance, in Portugal, we are starting to work on also those efficiencies.

Then you raised the point about net debt to EBITDA, if there are minorities. If they're our partners, as it is happening, for instance, in Cellnex in Switzerland, just to take on Cellnex Netherlands, there is a ring-fenced financing. Ring-fenced financing somehow has this characteristic that maximize the level of the debt in the different companies without having an impact on the corporate rating of Cellnex. 
And this is called subordination. Obviously, for us -- for me, in my view, as a CFO of this company, subordination is a red line that I will never cross. And so in this case, Fernando, I think that the answer is a little half -- more angle than only a net debt-to-EBITDA calculation. There are clear rules of subordination, clear rules of refinancing of the debt at the level of  the countries and also the partners that we can also to take into account.
