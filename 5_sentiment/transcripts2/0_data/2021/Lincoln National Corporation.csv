During 2020, Lincoln responded well to the immediate health, economic and capital market challenges. We also took steps to add new products and build distribution, improve cost effectiveness and strengthen the balance sheet. 
Fourth quarter earnings were affected by elevated pandemic-related claims in our Life and Group businesses, which was partially offset by another quarter of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio. 
Given this year's circumstances, we saw quite a bit of variability in earnings. When normalizing for several items in 2020, the largest of which were charges from our third quarter annual review and pandemic-related claims, we view our EPS for the year at approximately $9.30, and ROE, excluding AOCI, at 13%. Based on our current views, we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% EPS growth off this level over the long term. 
Focus items during the year included 3 initiatives: one, executing our reprice shift and add new product strategy; two, achieving expense savings while improving the customer experience; and three, maintaining a strong balance sheet and maximizing our financial flexibility. 
Let me touch on each of these. First, with our reprice shift and add new product strategy, our aggressive and disciplined repricing actions targeted, achieving appropriate returns on capital. As we exited the fourth quarter, we generated at least a 12% return on new business in our current portfolio based on the forward curve across all our businesses. As expected, sales decreased in most businesses with growth expected to reemerge over the course of the year based on the shift and add new components of our strategy. Also, several competitors followed our repricing actions, making our repriced products more competitive as we enter 2021. 
We are introducing 8 new products during the first half of this year that will increase consumer choice and expand our customer value propositions. These actions will further strengthen our product portfolio, enable us to participate in more market segments and increased sales opportunities. Combining our product breadth and distribution capabilities is part of our historic playbook that we will continue to execute on to drive top line growth. 
Second, on our efforts to increase efficiency while improving the customer experience. Expense management is a key priority. We are focused on actions that will further increase productivity across our manufacturing and distribution organizations and also enhance the customer and partner experience. 
Accelerated implementation and acceptance of digital tools is part of the reason we see the potential for further expense savings opportunities. As an example, during the fourth quarter, 99% of Life policies were delivered electronically, nearly triple the prior year quarter. Successes like this, combined with our overall expense management capability, are enabling us to start another meaningful expense savings program. We'll update you later this year as the project plan is finalized, and we size the opportunities. 
Third, on the balance sheet. We have successfully focused on protecting and further improving the balance sheet. Our RBC ratio and cash holding company have increased and remain above our targets. We also increased our financial flexibility through capital actions, including adding contingent capital and extending debt maturities out until September 2023. The investment portfolio has benefited from derisking actions and various government support programs. As a result, credit losses and downgrades have been less than expectations at the onset of the pandemic. 
Looking forward, capital generation will face some near-term headwinds from elevated COVID-related claims. However, given our strong balance sheet and overall free cash flow generation, we remain in the market, repurchasing our shares during the first quarter. Additionally, we have put more energy and resources into the potential risk transfer deals with a goal of enhancing capital deployment. 
Lastly, before shifting to segment results, it is important to note that since our last conference call in early November, we have seen a number of favorable developments, including the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, further gains in the equity markets and an increase in interest rates and continuing economic stimulus. All of these bode well for Lincoln over time.  
As I just noted, our underlying earnings are firmly intact, and we are positioned for growth as COVID impacts diminish. Many medical experts forecast that COVID-19 debts will peak in the first quarter and received over the course of the year. When mortality claims ultimately return to normal levels, we see earnings momentum building in the second half of this year and into 2022. 
Now turning to the business segments. Starting with Annuities, where we successfully leveraged our unique manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expanded our shelf space and the number of producers selling Lincoln's indexed variable annuity products doubled in 2020, which helped cement our leadership position in the IVA marketplace, which is the fastest-growing segment of the annuity market. 
In total, IVA sales were $5 billion for the year. Asset protection products like IVA are resonating with consumers and producers. This is contributing to our sales shifts toward variable annuities without living benefits. These sales represented more than 2/3 of total VA sales in 2020.  Based on our in-force, VAs without living benefits and other non-guaranteed products represent 47% and of total annuity account values. 
Growth in asset protection sales, combined with continued market demand for guaranteed living benefits, led to positive annual variable annuity net flows for the first time since 2015. As expected, total annuity sales were down as we deemphasized the fixed annuity sales due to return challenges in the current environment. 
In 2021, we expect to continue to benefit from our high-quality in-force book of business that generates consistent capital and strong returns. We project sales to begin the year consistent with the $2.5 billion run rate we have produced in recent quarters and billed over the course of the year as we benefit from our 2020 product introductions as well as products we plan to add this year. Our new products create additional consumer value propositions and expand on our already broad product portfolio. 
In Retirement Plan Services, our digitally focused model, where high-tech enables high-touch, continues to differentiate us in a virtual environment. While economic and pandemic-related uncertainty weighed on most businesses this year, strong performance from our sales and retention teams drove a 6% increase in total deposits, including growth in both first year sales and recurring deposits, along with our sixth consecutive year of positive net flows. 
Notably, some of the headwinds we have seen from employers reducing or eliminating matching contributions and workforce reductions have receded, with recurring deposits up slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a decline in the third quarter. Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the retirement business, and we expect momentum to continue as we are well positioned to compete in our target markets. 
Near term, we see further opportunities with YourPath, our alternative to target date funds, and longer term, we see significant potential from key positions in SECURE Act that facilitate providing protected income solutions to working Americans and multiple employer programs that address access to worksite retirement plans. 
Within the Life Insurance business, our focus in 2020 was on repricing and product innovation, with an eye on introducing new solutions during the first half of 2021. Given repricing actions, combined with record sales in the prior year quarter, sales declined year-over-year, and we expect sales to remain at similar levels until our new products are introduced. These new products offer consumers more choice and alternative value propositions, positioning us for long-term sales growth at attractive returns. 
While we continue offering guaranteed solutions, our product portfolio expansion leverages separate accounts as the investment engine providing non-guaranteed upside benefit potential for our consumers. Examples of these new products include our MoneyGuard and VUL solutions. As always, we will couple this expanded product portfolio with the strongest distribution platform in the industry, positioning us well in 2021 and beyond. 
Lastly, on Group Protection. Sales in our seasonally strongest quarter increased over the prior year period due to timing of when cases closed. While for the full year, sales declined 6% as gains in disability were more than offset by decreases in Life and Dental. Strong persistency of 87% of 350 basis points in 2020, more than offset the lower sales, which led to a 4% increase in premiums for the full year. 
Importantly, the contraction in premiums we experienced at the onset of the pandemic is stabilizing and quote activity has resumed, both of which are positive for premium growth. Even adjusting for the pandemic, margins were below target. We are taking action. And based on focused pricing enhancements, we began in 2020, along with expense initiatives, we expect continuous margin improvement over time, building towards our 7% target. 
Briefly on investment results. As I mentioned earlier, our investment portfolio has performed well through this volatile period for capital markets, highlighting sound portfolio construction and the high-quality nature of our portfolio. We manage credit risk defensively with proactive derisking as well as adjusting our new money allocation to higher-rated assets that match our liabilities at attractive yields. 
As a result of these actions, the credit quality of the portfolio is in line with pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the alternatives investment portfolio performed well in the quarter, and for the full year, generated an 11% annual return, slightly above our long-term target. 
In closing, I am very pleased with how Lincoln responded to this year's unique challenges, including product outcomes that further differentiate us in the marketplace. Importantly, I want to recognize our employees for their extraordinary efforts and unwavering commitment last year. We entered 2021 well positioned and a stronger franchise. Sales momentum should build over the course of the year at attractive returns as we benefit from new product introductions. Our digital tools and capabilities have never been stronger, which will enable us to further enhance the customer experience and improve productivity. 
We have a durable balance sheet with a high-quality investment portfolio and strong free cash flow generation and capital ratios. The underlying earnings power of our businesses are intact, and as I said earlier, we are poised to 8% to 10% growth over the long term, even in the current low interest rate environment.  As a result, I am optimistic about our ability to drive shareholder value. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $346 million or $1.78 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items.",1457,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $346 million or $1.78 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items. First, pandemic-related claims reduced earnings by approximately $187 million or $0.96 per share. This included a $174 million mortality impact and $13 million from disability claims.  Second, results benefited from strong performance in the alternatives investment portfolio relative to our targeted annual return of 10%, boosting earnings by $73 million or $0.38 per share. Third, there was unfavorable expense variability of $28 million or $0.13 per share in the Other Operations segment, related mostly to elevated deferred compensation costs resulting from the increase in Lincoln share price last quarter.  Finally, there was $20 million or $0.10 per share of favorable amortization levels in Life Insurance, which was largely offset by seasonal unfavorability in Group Protection. 
Net income totaled $143 million or $0.74 per share as improvements in credit spreads drove a $240 million loss in variable annuity nonperformance risk. Outside of this noneconomic item, credit experience was excellent. And the variable annuity hedge program performed exceptionally well with 100% effectiveness in the quarter. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating revenue increased 3%, with operating revenue growth in each of our 4 business segments. Average comp values increased to 9%. 
Total G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 1% or 7% when excluding unfavorable expense variability in other operations. The 1% decline combined with operating revenue growth led to a 60 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $71.59, an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $289 million compared to $269 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values, driven by growth in the equity markets. Average comp values of $151 billion increased 9% year-over-year and 5% on a sequential basis. Additionally, end-of-period account values exceeded average values by 4%, providing a tailwind into the first quarter. 
Base spreads, excluding variables and income, were up 8 basis points from the year ago quarter, driven by active management of crediting rates and some quarterly noises. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized, decreased 5% for the full year and quarter, leading to a 60 basis point improvement in the expense ratio for the quarter. G&A expenses rose sequentially due to typical fourth quarter seasonality. 
Return metrics remained healthy in the quarter, with return on assets coming in at 77 basis points and return on equity at 21.4%. Risk metrics on the VA book continue to demonstrate the quality of the business, as the net amount at risk fell to 70 basis points of account value for living benefits and to 34 basis points for death benefits. 
Continuing a theme that has been in place for well over a decade, 2020 was another excellent year for the Annuities business. Earnings grew in line with account values. And excluding the unlocking, return on equity was very strong, coming in at 21%. Looking into 2021, we expect more of the same. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $49 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter, as favorable alternative investment performance, expense management and higher average account values more than offset spread compression. Positive flows, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values up 10% over the prior year quarter. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 5% for the full year, driving a 140 basis point improvement in the expense ratio in 2020. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed to 28 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Spread compression was above normal, primarily due to lower yields on floating rate securities with the crediting rate on the matched liability adjusts less quickly. We expect this to moderate and return to our more typical 10 to 15 basis point range in 2021. 
The retirement business ended the year with strong results, including a 23 basis point ROA in the quarter, with momentum in sales and expense management serving as positive drivers going forward. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $144 million compared to $179 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results included $113 million of pandemic-related mortality, partly offset by $53 million of favorable alternative investment experience and the favorable amortization I noted upfront. 
Underlying earnings drivers continue to show growth, with average account values up 6% and and average life insurance in-force up 9% over the prior year. For the full year, outside of the pandemic, mortality was in line with our annual expectations. 
G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 13% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 140 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads declined to 25 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to a previously noted noneconomic change in our crediting rate methodology. We expect base spreads to return to our more typical 5 to 10 basis point rate of decline in 2021. 
Looking forward to the first quarter, we continue to expect headwinds from the pandemic, over in the coming months, the worst should be behind us and key life insurance earnings growth drivers remain strong. Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $42 million compared to operating earnings of $54 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease driven mainly by pandemic-related claims. 
Group earnings were impacted by a number of items during the quarter, including $74 million of claims related to the pandemic, $15 million to $20 million of seasonally higher fourth quarter disability claims and expenses and a slowdown in social security approvals that negatively impacted results by $8 million, partly offset by $5 million of favorable alternative investment experience. 
The reported total loss ratio was 87.8% in the quarter, of 4.6 points sequentially. This was driven in part by an increase in pandemic-related mortality and hospitalizations, which resulted in elevated claims including $39 million of direct COVID-19 mortality, $13 million of direct COVID-19 disability and $22 million of excess mortality. 
Excluding pandemic-related claims from both periods, the total loss ratio was 78.9%, up 3 percentage points sequentially, as improvement in Group Life and Dental were more than offset by an increase in the disability loss ratio. The sequential increase in the disability loss ratio was driven by typical fourth quarter seasonality as well as the previously mentioned slowdown in social security approvals. 
G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 6% from the prior year quarter and 5% for the full year. Excluding the pandemic and other items I mentioned, the earnings of the business were below our expectations. However, as Dennis mentioned, we are confident that the actions we have been taking will over time get us to our targeted margin. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the year with $10.3 billion of statutory surplus and an RBC ratio of 452%, which includes 23 percentage points from our noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition, that we expect will go away at the end of 2021. 
Cash at the holding company stands at $754 million, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. Additionally, we added a $500 million contingent capital facility earlier this year. This combination of strong life company capitalization, cash at the holding company, prefunding of debt maturities until 2023 and new sources of contingent capital puts us in a stronger, more diversified position than we were a year ago. 
We resumed buybacks in the fourth quarter and deployed $50 million towards share repurchases. As a result of our confidence in our capital position, we plan to increase our buyback to $100 million in the first quarter, and we'll provide additional updates on our next earnings conference call. 
To conclude, this year's result included a large impact from COVID-19, and we continue to expect headwinds from the pandemic in the near term. Looking past that, we see strong underlying earnings and solid drivers of EPS growth, including record end-of-period of account values; a strong record of expense discipline across the company; the ability to grow sales looking forward; pandemic-related headwinds that we believe will decline over 2021; and a robust capital position, providing us an ability to increase the pace of capital deployment. And as a result, we reiterate our plan to grow EPS at an 8% to 10% rate over the long term. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

Unfortunat",1050,"First, just a belief that we face a sizable charge in our life business as we've only taken $500 million of charges since 2011, and the report represents that this is too small a portion of our reserves versus charges that our peers have taken. Unfortunately, from my standpoint, I was correct the estimate of prior charges by noting that we've actually taken charges of nearly $1 billion since 2011. And including charges for mortality, which you can find in our SEC filings, those mortality charges have been focused on resolving many of the industry issues that are referenced. And the end result is that as we sit here today, we have mortality assumptions covering our business that are aligned with our credible experience and reflect the latest industry data on future mortality expectations. So in short,, I'd say we're very comfortable with all our assumptions, including those pertaining to mortality, I think that additionally, I just say, I've seen this use -- try to be used in other areas. You're using peers as the sole data point and driving expectations for -- so Lincoln, it's really a blend estimate approach. I think that really ignores the fact that every year assumptions are trued up for experience and go through a significant amount of internal and external audit review. So that's the first, I think, confusion that I want to clear up. 
The second thing, it's really just broadly on the adequacy of reserves. As it pertains to gap, just to remind everybody, 95% of our life reserves are governed by FAS 97. And they've been reviewed and updated every single year. When you turn to the small amount of business, that we have that is governed by FAS 60, we review those sufficiency of those reserves every year. And without getting into specifics, I'll note that there's a significant amount of sufficiency. When you turn the lens to statutory reserves, our cash flow testing results indicate an overall sufficiency of $14 billion at the end of 2019. And additionally, the new factor at I'd point out, with rates have increased somewhat, but I note that we now expect little to no impact from cash flow testing subtests at the end of 2021. So that's the second item I wanted to clear up some confusion on. 
The third is on this discussion around the potential for large price increases on reinsurance and/or recaptures. We've discussed this extensively. I think we've discussed this more than any other company out there, actually. And in fact, we noted that our a 2019 Investor Day that this issue is part of a $250 million annual headwind that was embedded in our earnings. As we sit here today, we've reached resolutions covering 70% of our seated face on. And I note that an additional 20% represents recent reinsurance treaties that are meeting all parties expectations for that remaining 10%. For that remaining small 10%, we've accounted for likely outcomes as part of our assumption setting process. So I really think we're in pretty good shape there. 
The fourth item I really digs into one of the reinsurers specifically, so as it relates to Scottish Re. It's -- that 3%, it's a small piece of our YRT reinsurance. It's included in that 10% that I noted as remaining. And I'd also point out that we did take charges on both GAAP and in 2020 to account for likely outcomes that might come from Scottish. 
So on this, and I know it wasn't a specific question you asked, but I really think there was some confusion that I wanted to clear up. So just maybe wrap up by saying that these represent the facts from Lincoln, in fact, that we've really talked about over the years, and we'll gladly discuss any of these issues further, any one of them, many meetings that we do with investors and analysts over the course of the year. So with that, hopefully, that clears up that confusion that I believe was put into the marketplace. 
So let me get around to your question on Life sales broadly and terms specifically. I think the term market itself is one where it's a price-sensitive market. So a little movements here, a little movements there by companies, we'll push sales up and down. I think, broadly speaking, in terms, we have continued to increase our position in that marketplace. Our share of the term market has continued to grown, I think, driven by our digitally focused ability to both issue and deliver policies, our automated underwriting capabilities, especially for policies under $1 million. So I think we're very happy with where we're positioned. We did make some small pricing tweaks here in the first quarter that I think will have a favorable impact. 
Broadly on life sales, what you saw in the fourth quarter was what we believe is a trough. I think we, at Lincoln, believe that when it came to repricing products that really needed to be repriced, given the environment, specifically low rates, we think we moved first on MoneyGuard, we moved first on other products. And I think that negatively impacted our level of sales. I do think that others followed. And so you saw a little bit of fire sale going on at some of our peers in the fourth quarter, and that probably negatively impacted our sales a little bit. 
I think the real key to Life and what we're really excited about is the work we did over 20 to create whole new value props, especially in the MoneyGuard space and in the variable space, those products were rolling out here in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter, excuse me, of 2021, we'd expect sales of those products to -- as usual, things start a little slow, but we'd expect them to ramp up over the course of the year. But I think those are products that really speak to the environment, right? You're using the separate accounts as the driver of value. You're shifting some risk to the consumer when doing that and away from Lincoln, and you're shifting products away from products that are negatively impacted by interest rates. So Andrew, that's what I broadly say about Life sales and specifically about term."

Number one, the term insurance under FAS 60 does get marked. So that could be -- does not get worked. So that could be a real issue. 
Number two, with regard to the assumption reviews, it absolutely came out to $500 million. There could have been other stuff. And then thirdly, in terms of looking over a 10-year period and saying don't look at your comps, and you didn't mention the statutory numbers over 10 years, which was widely different from you versus all of your peers. I mean, the earnings were just outsized. So I think over a 10-year period, given that we don't have the data, this blunt indication is quite a jump out given Lincoln's exposure. 
And then thirdly, you mentioned that you recaptured most of the business. And the points of our research were that the companies that did recapture were anti selected against because reinsurers had outsized information and ultimately recapturing the business and not leaving it with the reinsurers over the long-haul should be problematic. 
With regard to Scottish, I get that it's small relative to everything else, but over $12 million in-force on an absolute basis reinsured with a company that's in rehab and could experience severe problems. That's a lot of money on a stand-alone basis. So I'll just leave it at that, but there's absolutely no confusion on our end. And I appreciate your feedback."

I can add, and you can add up $500 million -- I'm telling you, factually, it's $1 billion. So on the financial statements, I looked at the numbers, it's $1 billion. So you can continue to say it's $500 million, but just let me say, you're wrong, period end of starting on that topic. 
Once again, on this whole concept of FAS 60, it's 5% of our reserves, significant amount of sufficiency reserves really don't expect any issues when it comes to LDTI around that small component of our business once again. So I'm just going to beg differ. 
In terms of the stat earnings concept, I mean, if you look at our stat earnings over those years, and by the way, my numbers are a little different than yours? It's not materially different. They represent just a fraction of GAAP reserves, which is what you would expect, right? It's roughly 40% to 50% of GAAP reserve. That's what you would expect -- our GAAP earnings, excuse me, is what you'd expect there is strain in issuing business, and we're one of the leading writers of life insurance. So the results, to me, look right in line with what I would expect on Scottish. I noted at the end, we did put up impacts in our financial statements in 2020 for potential impacts from anything that happens there. So yes, I hope that the answer. Andrew, you are -- as with any analyst, you are -- it's your job to go and assess companies and you're open to come up with a pin you want. I'm just trying to correct some of the confusion created by some points in there, but I just don't think are correct, and I tried to give the facts from Lincoln side. So I appreciate your thoughts, and thanks, Andrew."

Let me start by saying that just when I look at the market for risk transfer, it's pretty active. And it's active across a couple of spectrums. And not only is it active, but more capital is coming into the industry from players that haven't been in the industry before. So overall, it's a pretty active market. 
In terms of kind of activity, it includes block transactions, Lincoln has done one, as you know. It includes strategic transactions that have been going on, asset management companies. And there's been some flow transactions. And again, as you know, we have done those in the past, both on our fixed annuity portfolio and our variable annuity portfolio. So active market Lincoln has participated in all dimensions of it over the past, and we'll keep looking at each of those components. 
In terms of sizing, I think we'll have to wait and see on that. It's sort of hard to -- what's big and what's small. But we'll be looking at meaningful transactions, I guess, is the way I would respond to it. So I'm quite encouraged that there will be opportunities of the time we've transacted in the past for Lincoln."

And I think it's fair to say that the amount of capital that we allocate to new business is lower today than it was a couple of years ago. So I think over time, that will definitely be a benefit. 
Now I think you have to look through 2021 here because I think the pandemic is going to be providing some negative impacts to distributable earnings for at least the first half of the year. But yes, I think over time, when you think about how we're allocating capital, we're allocating less to new business.

What I think that pandemic really sort of right shifted what is our belief, which is that when you start at the 5% to 5.5% a little, we have clear vision on growing that to 7% over a planning cycle. And it's really driven by 4 big elements, really executing on 4 things. It's pricing, it's expenses, it's claims management and it's underwriting. So we, inside of Lincoln, have a clear vision from going where we are today, sort of in that 5.5% range towards that 2% to 7%, which is our ultimate target, as Dennis mentioned.

If you factor that in, I think you'd get down to a sort of range of 78.5% to 79%, and that compares to roughly 77.5% to 78% in the third quarter when you adjust for COVID. So I think we're a little above where we were. But underneath the noise that's being driven by COVID and social security approvals, et cetera, and then the seasonality, I think we're just a little worse than what our target would be. And I think that's really driven by one big factor, which is that -- we did lower our discount rate. In the LTV business this year. That's had a little bit of a negative impact. Now the good point there is that we had clear insight early in the year that, that was something we were going to do. And so we've been putting it into price all year, all the bids we've put out. And all -- this nature of the group business, a lot of those cases will hit on January 1.

During 2020, Lincoln responded well to the immediate health, economic, and capital market challenges. We also took steps to add new products and build distribution, improve cost-effectiveness, and strengthen the balance sheet.
Fourth quarter earnings were affected by elevated pandemic-related claims in our Life and Group businesses, which was partially offset by another quarter of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio.
Given this year's circumstances, we saw quite a bit of variability in earnings. When normalizing for several items in 2020, the largest of which were charges from our third quarter annual review, and pandemic-related claims, we view our EPS for the year at approximately $9.30, and ROE, excluding AOCI, at 13%. Based on our current views, we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% EPS growth off this level over the long-term.
Focus items during the year included 3 initiatives: one, executing our reprice shift, and add new product strategy; two, achieving expense savings while improving the customer experience; and three, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and maximizing our financial flexibility.
Let me touch on each of these. First, with our reprice shift and add new product strategy, our aggressive and disciplined repricing actions targeted, achieving appropriate returns on capital. 
As we exited the fourth quarter, we generated at least a 12% return on new business in our current portfolio based on the forward curve across all our businesses. As expected, sales decreased in most businesses with growth expected to reemerge over the course of the year based on the shift and add new components of our strategy. 
Also, several competitors followed our repricing actions, making our repriced products more competitive as we enter 2021.
We are introducing 8 new products during the first half of this year that will increase consumer choice and expand our customer value propositions. These actions will further strengthen our product portfolio, enable us to participate in more market segments and increased sales opportunities. 
Combining our product breadth, and distribution capabilities is part of our historic playbook that we will continue to execute on to drive top-line growth.
Second, on our efforts to increase efficiency while improving the customer experience. 
Expense management is a key priority. We are focused on actions that will further increase productivity across our manufacturing and distribution organizations and also enhance the customer and partner experience.
Accelerated implementation and acceptance of digital tools is part of the reason we see the potential for further expense savings opportunities. As an example, during the fourth quarter, 99% of Life policies were delivered electronically, nearly triple the prior year quarter. 
Successes like this, combined with our overall expense management capability, are enabling us to start another meaningful expense savings program. We'll update you later this year as the project plan is finalized, and we seize the opportunities.
Third, on the balance sheet. We have successfully focused on protecting and further improving the balance sheet. Our RBC ratio and cash at the holding company have increased and remain above our targets. 
We also increased our financial flexibility through capital actions, including adding contingent capital and extending debt maturities out until September 2023. The investment portfolio has benefited from derisking actions and various government support programs. As a result, credit losses and downgrades have been less than expectations at the onset of the pandemic.
Looking forward, capital generation will face some near-term headwinds from elevated COVID-related claims. However, given our strong balance sheet and overall free cash flow generation, we remain in the market, repurchasing our shares during the first quarter. 
Additionally, we have put more energy and resources into the potential risk transfer deals with a goal of enhancing capital deployment.
Lastly, before shifting to segment results, it is important to note that since our last conference call in early November, we have seen a number of favorable developments, including the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, further gains in the equity markets, and an increase in interest rates, and continuing economic stimulus. All of these bode well for Lincoln over time.
As I just noted, our underlying earnings are firmly intact, and we are positioned for growth as COVID impacts diminish. Many medical experts forecast that COVID-19 deaths will peak in the first quarter and received over the course of the year. When mortality claims ultimately return to normal levels, we see earnings momentum building in the second half of this year and into 2022.
Now turning to the business segments. Starting with Annuities, where we successfully leveraged our unique manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expanded our shelf space and the number of producers selling Lincoln's indexed variable annuity products doubled in 2020, which helped cement our leadership position in the IVA marketplace, which is the fastest-growing segment of the annuity market.
In total, IVA sales were $5 billion for the year. Asset protection products like IVA are resonating with consumers and producers. 
This is contributing to our sales shifts toward variable annuities without living benefits. These sales represented more than 2/3 of total VA sales in 2020.  Based on our in-force, VAs without living benefits and other non-guaranteed products represent 47% of total annuity account values.
Growth in asset protection sales, combined with continued market demand for guaranteed living benefits, led to positive annual variable annuity net flows for the first time since 2015. 
As expected, total annuity sales were down as we deemphasized the fixed annuity sales due to return challenges in the current environment.
In 2021, we expect to continue to benefit from our high-quality in-force book of business that generates consistent capital and strong returns. We project sales to begin the year consistent with the $2.5 billion run rate we have produced in recent quarters and billed over the course of the year as we benefit from our 2020 product introductions as well as products, we plan to add this year. 
Our new products create additional consumer value propositions and expand on our already broad product portfolio.
In Retirement Plan Services, our digitally focused model, where high-tech enables high touch, continues to differentiate us in a virtual environment. While economic and pandemic-related uncertainty weighed on most businesses this year, strong performance from our sales and retention teams drove a 6% increase in total deposits, including growth in both first year sales and recurring deposits, along with our sixth consecutive year of positive net flows.
Notably, some of the headwinds we have seen from employers reducing or eliminating matching contributions and workforce reductions have receded, with recurring deposits up slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a decline in the third quarter. 
Overall, it was a strong quarter and year for the retirement business, and we expect momentum to continue as we are well positioned to compete in our target markets.
Near-term, we see further opportunities with YourPath, our alternative to target-date funds, and longer term, we see significant potential from key positions in SECURE Act that facilitate providing protected income solutions to working Americans and multiple employer programs that address access to worksite retirement plans.
Within the Life Insurance business, our focus in 2020 was on repricing and product innovation, with an eye on introducing new solutions during the first half of 2021. Given repricing actions, combined with record sales in the prior year quarter, sales declined year-over-year, and we expect sales to remain at similar levels until our new products are introduced. 
These new products offer consumers more choice and alternative value propositions, positioning us for long-term sales growth at attractive returns.
While we continue offering guaranteed solutions, our product portfolio expansion leverages separate accounts as the investment engine providing non-guaranteed upside benefit potential for our consumers. Examples of these new products include our MoneyGuard and VUL solutions. As always, we will couple this expanded product portfolio with the strongest distribution platform in the industry, positioning us well in 2021 and beyond.
Lastly, on Group Protection. Sales in our seasonally strongest quarter increased over the prior year period due to timing of when cases closed. While for the full year, sales declined 6% as gains in disability were more than offset by decreases in Life and Dental. Strong persistency of 87%, up 350 basis points in 2020, more than offset the lower sales, which led to a 4% increase in premiums for the full year.
Importantly, the contraction in premiums we experienced at the onset of the pandemic is stabilizing and quote activity has resumed, both of which are positive for premium growth. 
Even adjusting for the pandemic, margins were below target. We are taking action. And based on focused pricing enhancements, we began in 2020, along with expense initiatives, we expect continuous margin improvement over time, building towards our 7% target.
Briefly on investment results. As I mentioned earlier, our investment portfolio has performed well through this volatile period for capital markets, highlighting sound portfolio construction and the high-quality nature of our portfolio. We manage credit risk defensively with proactive derisking as well as adjusting our new money allocation to higher-rated assets that match our liabilities at attractive yields.
As a result of these actions, the credit quality of the portfolio is in line with pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the alternatives investment portfolio performed well in the quarter, and for the full year, generated an 11% annual return, slightly above our long-term target.
In closing, I am very pleased with how Lincoln responded to this year's unique challenges, including product outcomes that further differentiate us in the marketplace. 
Importantly, I want to recognize our employees for their extraordinary efforts and unwavering commitment last year. We entered 2021 well positioned and a stronger franchise. Sales momentum should build over the course of the year at attractive returns as we benefit from new product introductions. Our digital tools and capabilities have never been stronger, which will enable us to further enhance the customer experience and improve productivity.
We have a durable balance sheet with a high-quality investment portfolio and strong free cash flow generation and capital ratios. The underlying earnings power of businesses are intact, and as I said earlier, we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% growth over the long-term, even in the current low-interest rate environment.  As a result, I am optimistic about our ability to drive shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $346 million or $1.78 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items.",1447,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $346 million or $1.78 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items. 
First, pandemic-related claims reduced earnings by approximately $187 million or $0.96 per share. This included a $174 million mortality impact and $13 million from disability claims.  
Second, results benefited from strong performance in the alternatives investment portfolio relative to our targeted annual return of 10%, boosting earnings by $73 million or $0.38 per share. 
Third, there was unfavorable expense variability of $28 million or $0.13 per share in the Other Operations segment, related mostly to elevated deferred compensation costs resulting from the increase in Lincoln share price last quarter.  
Finally, there was $20 million or $0.10 per share of favorable amortization levels in Life Insurance, which was largely offset by seasonal unfavorability in Group Protection.
Net income totaled $143 million or $0.74 per share as improvements in credit spreads drove a $240 million loss in variable annuity nonperformance risk. Outside of this noneconomic item, credit experience was excellent. And the variable annuity hedge program performed exceptionally well with 100% effectiveness in the quarter.
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating revenue increased 3%, with operating revenue growth in each of our 4 business segments. Average comp values increased to 9%.
Total G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 1% or 7% when excluding unfavorable expense variability in other operations. The 1% decline combined with operating revenue growth led to a 60-basis point improvement in the expense ratio. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $71.59, an all-time high.
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $289 million compared to $269 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values, driven by growth in the equity markets. Average comp values of $151 billion increased 9% year-over-year and 5% on a sequential basis. Additionally, end-of-period account values exceeded average values by 4%, providing a tailwind into the first quarter.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were up 8 basis points from the year ago quarter, driven by active management of crediting rates and some quarterly noises. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized, decreased 5% for the full year and quarter, leading to a 60-basis point improvement in the expense ratio for the quarter. G&A expenses rose sequentially due to typical fourth quarter seasonality.
Return metrics remained healthy in the quarter, with return on assets coming in at 77 basis points and return on equity at 21.4%. 
Risk metrics on the VA book continue to demonstrate the quality of the business, as the net amount at risk fell to 70 basis points of account value for living benefits and to 34 basis points for death benefits.
Continuing a theme that has been in place for well over a decade, 2020 was another excellent year for the Annuities business. Earnings grew in line with account values. And excluding the unlocking, return on equity was very strong, coming in at 21%. Looking into 2021, we expect more of the same.
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $49 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter, as favorable alternative investment performance, expense management, and higher-average account values more than offset spread compression. 
Positive flows, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values up 10% over the prior year quarter. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 5% for the full year, driving a 140-basis point improvement in the expense ratio in 2020.
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed to 28 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Spread compression was above normal, primarily due to lower yields on floating-rate securities with the crediting rate on the matched liability adjusts less quickly. We expect this to moderate and return to our more typical 10 to 15 basis point range in 2021.
The retirement business ended the year with strong results, including a 23-basis point ROA in the quarter, with momentum in sales and expense management serving as positive drivers going forward.
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $144 million compared to $179 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results included $113 million of pandemic-related mortality, partly offset by $53 million of favorable alternative investment experience and the favorable amortization I noted upfront. 
Underlying earnings drivers continue to show growth, with average account values up 6% and average Life Insurance in-force up 9% over the prior year. For the full year, outside of the pandemic, mortality was in line with our annual expectations.
G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 13% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 140-basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads declined to 25 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to a previously noted noneconomic change in our crediting rate methodology. We expect base spreads to return to our more typical 5 to 10 basis point rate of decline in 2021.
Looking forward to the first quarter, we continue to expect headwinds from the pandemic, over in the coming months, the worst should be behind us and key Life Insurance earnings growth drivers remain strong. 
Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $42 million compared to operating earnings of $54 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease driven mainly by pandemic-related claims.
Group earnings were impacted by a number of items during the quarter, including $74 million of claims related to the pandemic, $15 million to $20 million of seasonally higher fourth quarter disability claims and expenses, and a slowdown in social security approval that negatively impacted results by $8 million, partly offset by $5 million of favorable alternative investment experience.
The reported total loss ratio was 87.8% in the quarter, up 4.6 points sequentially. This was driven in part by an increase in pandemic-related mortality and hospitalizations, which resulted in elevated claims including $39 million of direct COVID-19 mortality, $13 million of direct COVID-19 disability, and $22 million of excess mortality.
Excluding pandemic-related claims from both periods, the total loss ratio was 78.9%, up 3 percentage points sequentially, as improvement in Group Life and Dental were more than offset by an increase in the disability loss ratio. 
The sequential increase in the disability loss ratio was driven by typical fourth quarter seasonality as well as the previously mentioned slowdown in social security approvals.
G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 6% from the prior year quarter and 5% for the full year. Excluding the pandemic and other items I mentioned, the earnings of the business were below our expectations. However, as Dennis mentioned, we are confident that the actions we have been taking will over time get us to our targeted margin.
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the year with $10.3 billion of statutory surplus and an RBC ratio of 452%, which includes 23 percentage points from our noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition, that we expect will go away at the end of 2021.
Cash at the holding company stands at $754 million, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. 
Additionally, we added a $500 million contingent capital facility earlier this year. This combination of strong life company capitalization, cash at the holding company, prefunding of debt maturities until 2023, and new sources of contingent capital puts us in a stronger, more diversified position than we were a year ago.
We resumed buybacks in the fourth quarter and deployed $50 million towards share repurchases. As a result of our confidence in our capital position, we plan to increase our buyback to $100 million in the first quarter, and we'll provide additional updates on our next earnings conference call.
To conclude, this year's result included a large impact from COVID-19, and we continue to expect headwinds from the pandemic in the near-term. Looking past that, we see strong underlying earnings and solid drivers of EPS growth, including record end-of-period of account values; a strong record of expense discipline across the company; the ability to grow sales looking forward; pandemic-related headwinds that we believe will decline over 2021; and a robust capital position, providing us an ability to increase the pace of capital deployment. And as a result, we reiterate our plan to grow EPS at an 8% to 10% rate over the long-term.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

Unf",1054,"First, it's just a belief that we face a sizable charge in our Life business as we've only taken $500 million of charges since 2011, and the report represents that this is too smaller portion of our reserves versus charges that our peers have taken. 
Unfortunately, from my standpoint, I was correct the estimate of prior charges by noting that we've actually taken charges of nearly $1 billion since 2011. Including charges for mortality, which you can find in our SEC filings, those mortality charges have been focused on resolving many of the industry issues that are referenced.
And the end result is that as we sit here today, we have mortality assumptions covering our business that are aligned with our credible experience and reflect the latest industry data on future mortality expectations. 
So in short, let's just say we're very comfortable with all our assumptions, including those pertaining to mortality. I think that additionally, I'd just say, I've seen this use -- try to be used in other areas. You're using peers as the sole data point and driving expectations for. 
So Lincoln -- it's really a blend estimate approach. I think that really ignores the fact that every year our assumptions are trued up for experience and go through a significant amount of internal and external audit review. So that's the first, I think, confusion that I want to clear up.
The second thing, it's really just broadly on the adequacy of reserves. As it pertains to gap, just to remind everybody, 95% of our life reserves are governed by FAS 97. And they've been reviewed and updated every single year. 
When you turn to the small amount of business, that we have that is governed by FAS 60, we review those sufficiency of those reserves every year. And without getting into specifics, I'll note that there's a significant amount of sufficiency. 
When you turn the lens to statutory reserves, our cash flow testing results indicate an overall sufficiency of $14 billion at the end of 2019. 
And additionally, the new factor I'd then point out, with rates have increased somewhat, but I note that we now expect little to no impact from cash flow testing subtests at the end of 2021. So that's the second item I wanted to clear up some confusion on.
The third is on this discussion around the potential for large price increases on reinsurance and/or recaptures. We've discussed this extensively. I think we've discussed this more than any other company out there, actually. And in fact, we noted that our 2019 Investor Day that this issue is part of a $250 million annual headwind that was embedded in our earnings. As we sit here today, we've reached resolutions covering 70% of our seated face along. 
And I note that an additional 20% represents recent reinsurance treaties that are meeting all parties' expectations for that remaining 10%. For that remaining in small 10%, we've accounted for likely outcomes as part of our assumption setting process. So I really think we're in pretty good shape there.
The fourth item really digs into one of the reinsurers specifically, so as it relates to Scottish Re. It's -- that 3%, it's a small piece of our YRT reinsurance. It's included in that 10% that I noted as remaining. And I'd also point out that we did take charges on both [ gap and step ] in 2020 to account for likely outcomes that might come from Scottish.
So on this, and I know it wasn't a specific question you asked, but I really think there was some confusion that I wanted to clear up. So just maybe wrap up by saying that these represent the facts from Lincoln, in fact, that we've really talked about over the years, and we'll gladly discuss any of these issues further, any one of them, many meetings that we do with investors and analysts over the course of the year. So with that, hopefully, that clears up that confusion that I believe was put into the marketplace.
So let me get around to your question on Life sales broadly and terms specifically. I think the term market itself is one where it's a price-sensitive market. So a little movements here, a little movements there by companies, we'll push sales up and down. 
I think, broadly speaking, in terms, we have continued to increase our position in that marketplace. Our share of the term market has continued to grown, I think, driven by our digitally focused ability to both issue and deliver policies, our automated underwriting capabilities, especially for policies under $1 million. 
So I think we're very happy with where we're positioned. We did make some small pricing tweaks here in the first quarter that I think will have a favorable impact.
Broadly on Life sales, what you saw in the fourth quarter was what we believe is a trough. I think we, at Lincoln, believe that when it came to repricing products that really needed to be repriced, given the environment, specifically low rates, we think we moved first on MoneyGuard, we moved first on other products. 
And I think that negatively impacted our level of sales. I do think that others followed. And so you saw a little bit of fire sale going on at some of our peers in the fourth quarter, and that probably negatively impacted our Life sales a little bit.
I think the real key to Life and what we're really excited about is the work we did over 2020 to create whole new value props, especially in the MoneyGuard space and in the variable space, those products we're rolling out here in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter, excuse me, of 2021, we'd expect sales of those products to -- as usual, things start a little slow, but we'd expect them to ramp up over the course of the year. 
But I think those are products that really speak to the environment, right? You're using the separate accounts as the driver of value. You're shifting some risk to the consumer when doing that and away from Lincoln, and you're shifting products away from products that are negatively impacted by interest rates. So Andrew, that's what I broadly say about Life sales and specifically about term."

Number one, the term insurance under FAS 60 does get marked. So that could be -- does not get worked. So that could be a real issue.
Number two, with regard to the assumption reviews, it absolutely came out to $500 million. There could have been other stuff. 
And then thirdly, in terms of looking over a 10-year period and saying don't look at your comps, and you didn't mention the statutory numbers over 10 years, which was widely different from you versus all of your peers. I mean, the earnings were just outsized. So I think over a 10-year period, given that we don't have the data, this blunt indication is quite a jump out given Lincoln's exposure.
And then thirdly, you mentioned that you recaptured most of the business. And the points of our research were that the companies that did recapture were anti selected against because the reinsurers had outsized information and ultimately recapturing the business and not leaving it with the reinsurers over the long-haul should be problematic.

I can add, and you can add up to $500 million, I'm telling you, factually, it's $1 billion. So I mean on the financial statements, I looked at the numbers, it's $1 billion. So you can continue to say it's $500 million, but just let me say, you're wrong, period end of starting on that topic.
Once again, on this whole concept of FAS 60, it's 5% of our reserves, significant amount of sufficiency reserves really don't expect any issue when it comes to LDTI around that small component of our business once again. So I'm just going to beg differ.
In terms of the stat earnings concept, I mean, if you look at our stat earnings over those years, and by the way, my numbers are a little different than yours. It's not materially different. They represent just a fraction of GAAP reserves, which is what you would expect, right? It's roughly 40% to 50% of GAAP reserve. That's what you would expect -- our GAAP earnings, excuse me, is what you'd expect there is strain in issuing business, and we're one of the leading writers of Life Insurance.
So the results, to me, look right in line with what I would expect on Scottish. I noted at the end, we did put up impacts in our financial statements in 2020 for potential impacts from anything that happens there. So yes, I hope that the answers -- Andrew, you are -- as with any analyst, you are -- it's your job to go and assess companies and you're open to come up with any opinion you want. 
I'm just trying to correct some of the confusion created by some points in there, but I just don't think are correct, and I tried to give the facts from Lincoln side. So I appreciate your thoughts, and thanks, Andrew."

Let me start by saying that just when I look at the market for risk transfer, it's pretty active. And it's active across a couple of spectrums. And not only is it active, but more capital is coming into the industry from players that haven't been in the industry before. So overall, it's a pretty active market.
In terms of kind of activity, it includes block transactions, Lincoln has done one, as you know. It includes strategic transactions that have been going on, asset management companies. And there's been some flow transactions. 
And again, as you know, we have done those in the past, and both on our fixed annuity portfolio and our variable annuity portfolio. So active market Lincoln has participated in all dimensions of it over the past, and we'll keep looking at each of those components.
In terms of sizing, I think we'll have to wait and see on that. It's sort of hard to -- what's big and what's small. But we'll be looking at meaningful transactions, I guess, is the way I would respond to it. So I'm quite encouraged that there will be opportunities of the time we've transacted in the past for Lincoln."

If you think about sort of the mix of sales that we have today,  little less capital intensive. And I think it's fair to say that the amount of capital that we allocate to new business is lower today than it was a couple of years ago. So I think over time, that will definitely be a benefit.
Now I think you have to look through 2021 here because I think the pandemic is going to be providing some negative impacts to distributable earnings for at least the first half of the year. But yes, I think over time, when you think about how we're allocating capital, we're allocating less to new business.

If you sort of added that in, you'd be sort of at a normalized number of $50 million to $55 million in that 5% to 5.5% range, which if you look back to last year is kind of where we were last year. 
We exited 2019 in that 5% to 5.5% range. What I think that the pandemic, it really sort of right-shifted what is our belief, which is that when you start at the 5% to 5.5% a little, we have clear vision on growing that to 7% over a planning cycle. And it's really driven by 4 big elements, really executing on 4 things. It's pricing, its expenses, its claims management, and its underwriting. 
So we, inside of Lincoln, have a clear vision from going where we are today, sort of in that 5.5% range towards that 2% to 7%, which is our ultimate target, as Dennis mentioned. And then I think COVID sort of caused it to be right shifted 1 year from where we were last year. So that's how we think about the Group business as we sit here today, Erik."

And then when you think about the seasonality, which we typically see in the fourth quarter, we saw this year in the fourth quarter, we saw last year in the fourth quarter, which you factor that in, I think you'd get down to a sort of range of 78.5% to 79%, and that compares to roughly 77.5% to 78% in the third quarter when you adjust for COVID. 
So I think we're a little above where we were. But underneath the noise that's being driven by COVID and social security approvals, et cetera, and then the seasonality, I think we're just a little worse than what our target would be. And I think that's really driven by one big factor, which is that -- we did lower our discount rate, in the LTV business this year. That's had a little bit of a negative impact. 
Now the good point there is that we had clear insight early in the year that that was something we were going to do. And so we've been putting it into price all year, all the bids we've put out. And all -- that's the nature of the Group business, a lot of those cases will hit on January 1. 
So you feel good that the price to cover that discount rate decrease is coming in the first quarter, which hopefully can put us back into that more normal range outside of any negative impacts that we might see from COVID."

So each of the bars can change given the circumstances that we find ourselves in macroeconomic conditions, pandemics, and so forth, but management driving toward that 8% to 10% and to repeat what Randy and I have both said, we can see ourselves getting to that up to the $9.30.

Lincoln had a strong start to the year against an improving but still challenging environment. We have continued to execute our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, manage expenses, improve the customer experience and maintain a strong balance sheet. 
First quarter earnings were affected by elevated pandemic-related claims in our Life and Group businesses, though this was partially offset by another quarter of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio. We are pleased with the earnings power Lincoln showed in the quarter and the outlook for our business is positive. 
Now let me touch on the major initiatives that are helping bolster our franchise and earnings power. First, as a result of our proactive and disciplined repricing actions, we are achieving targeted returns in each of our businesses. As a result of our reprice, shift and add new product strategy and the fact that several peers filed our repricing actions, our sales pipelines have begun to expand, and we expect continued sales recovery in the upcoming quarters. 
We're introducing 8 new products in the first half of this year, which increased consumer choice, broadened the product portfolio and enabled our participation in more market segments. Our new product strategy also gives us a great deal of optionality. If interest rates remain low, our newly launched products will remain attractive given their strong consumer value propositions driven by their innovative product design. If rates continue to rise, in addition to these newer products, some offerings already on our show would once again resonate with consumers, and that would also be beneficial to Lincoln's sales results. 
Second, we are focused on actions to increase productivity across our manufacturing, operations and distribution organizations, while enhancing the customer and partner experience. We continue to report declining expense ratios in most of our businesses, while at the same time, investing in client-facing digital tools. Our demonstrated expense management capabilities will guide us as we start another meaningful expense savings program later this year. 
Third, We have successfully focused on improving the balance sheet, both our RBC ratio and cash at the holding company have increased and remain above target, giving us the confidence to increase our share repurchase pace. Furthermore, as we evaluate risk transfer deals, we would expect for this to provide additional upside potential to our capital deployment, if finalized. 
Now turning to the business segments. Starting with annuities. We continue to successfully leverage our industry-leading manufacturing capabilities to create new customer value propositions and expand our already broad product portfolio. Last year, we established ourselves as a leader in indexed variable annuities. This year, we are seeing growth in both IVAs and traditional variable annuities without living benefits with total sales of nonliving benefit VAs up 44% versus the prior year quarter and 9% sequentially. 
Growth in these products, combined with continued market demand for guaranteed living benefits, led to total VA sales growth both versus the prior year quarter and sequentially. We had projected sales to begin the year at a similar pace to that seen in the fourth quarter and build over the course of the year as we benefit from products introduced both this year and last. And we are pleased to see that sales growth is ahead of our expected pace. In fact, this was the first quarter in a year that we saw sequential sales growth across all product categories in the Annuities business. 
While we experienced negative net flows in the quarter, this is a direct result of management's actions to maintain rigorous return standards and to allow us to continue to direct capital to the highest and best use. In 2021, we expect the earnings to continue to benefit from our high-quality in-force book that generates consistent cash flows and returns and provides excellent value for customers. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we once again reported strong results driven by our digitally optimized model. This model where high-tech enables high touch differentiates us in the virtual environment. Our innovative product development capabilities are driving results, and we are excited about the continued success of our target date fund alternative, YourPath, as well as the recent launch of Income America, an innovative and simplified income solution for retirement plan participants. 
Although total deposits were down slightly compared to the very strong prior year quarter, we are optimistic looking forward given our robust sales pipeline. We reported positive net flows once again this quarter. And while flows can be lumpy, we expect this momentum to persist as we remain well positioned in our target markets. It was another excellent quarter for the retirement business, and we expect to benefit from the tailwinds of an improved economic backdrop, our ongoing investments in the customer experience, and our expanding set of solutions aimed at helping Americans secure their retirement. 
Within the Life Insurance business, we are positioning ourselves for growth through product innovation and distribution expansion. Sales in the quarter were flat sequentially, but we expect will ramp up over the course of the year as we begin to reap the benefits of solutions we've recently launched into the market. We're seeing good momentum with some key new product rollouts. Our expanded VUL offerings continue to gain shelf space and our innovative MoneyGuard Market Advantage product is appealing to new market segments. Additionally, we are beginning to attract a broader range of advisers with nearly 1/4 being producers who had not previously sold a MoneyGuard product. 
These new products, coupled with our existing life offerings and the industry's strongest distribution force, position Lincoln for long-term success at attractive returns. Additionally, we are expanding our strong distribution network by adding our life insurance products to the shelf of a large P&C insurer where we have an existing annuity distribution partnership. We are seeing good early momentum, particularly with our Term Excel Solution, which is a fully digital experience and is enabling us to reach a different customer segment. 
I'm pleased with the solid results the Life Insurance business reported. I am also excited that Lincoln is introducing products with new value propositions that are resonating with customers and helping to drive future growth. 
Lastly, on Group Protection. Premiums rose more than 2% over the prior year quarter and nearly 7% sequentially, driven by improved persistency, price increases and organic growth resulting from the economic recovery. Sales in what is typically a seasonally smaller quarter were down versus the strong prior year quarter. However, underlying drivers were positive as 2/3 of our sales were employee paid products. 
As we communicated last quarter, we are taking actions to increase Group Protection margins. We are already seeing improved results as factors such as pricing actions, higher persistency and investments in our claim organization have put our margin, excluding the pandemic and excess alternative income, in the lower end of our targeted range. We continue to expect further expansion building gradually towards the upper end of our 5% to 7% margin target. 
Briefly on investment results. As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio is performing quite well. Overall credit quality remains high and has continued to improve in recent years, driven by our high-quality new money purchases and proactive derisking. 96% of our fixed income assets are investment grade with 59% rated A or higher. Our well-diversified commercial mortgage loan book has continued to perform well during the pandemic with virtually no credit losses and minimal loan modifications. 
Additionally, our alternatives performance was once again strong, driven by our portfolio construction that emphasized buyout and growth equity strategies, with a quarterly return of 8% significantly exceeding our long-term target quarterly return of 2.5%.
In closing, I would note, sales momentum is building at attractive returns, driven by new product introductions that resonate with our customer and expanded shelf space across distribution channels. Continued equity market tailwinds should boost earnings from fees on assets under management in the Annuities and RPS businesses. The outlook for the Life Insurance business is strong, as our new products are starting to take hold in the market. Group Protection's underlying profitability, is experiencing an ongoing recovery. 
Expense savings initiatives will continue to contribute to earnings growth. And our robust balance sheet, high-quality investment portfolio, strong free cash flow generation and capital ratios, as well as the opportunity to execute risk transfer deals all leave Lincoln in an excellent position to fund expected sales growth while increasing our capital deployment. Based on these positive trends, 2021 is shaping up to be a successful year, and I expect will improve on this quarter's results. I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,709177097,2272683,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $350 million or $1.82 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items.",1255,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $350 million or $1.82 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items. 
First, pandemic-related claims reduced earnings by $222 million or $1.15 per share. Second, results benefited from strong performance in the alternatives investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $84 million or $0.43 per share above target. Third, there was $11 million or $0.06 per share of unfavorable tax adjustments. Finally, within the Other Operations segment, there was $11 million or $0.06 per share of expense variability related to elevated deferred compensation costs resulting from the increase in Lincoln share price during the quarter. Adding these items together, it was no doubt an extremely strong quarter that highlights our underlying earnings power. 
Net income totaled $225 million or $1.16 per share with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income, primarily being driven by $144 million noneconomic loss from variable annuity nonperformance risk. The VA hedge program performed exceptionally well with 99% effectiveness in the quarter. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating revenue increased 6% with operating revenue growth in each of our 4 business segments. Average account values increased 15%, the expense ratio declined in all businesses, except Group Protection, where it remained flat. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $72.36, an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $290 million compared to $261 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by growth in the equity markets as favorable alternative investment income was offset by $9 million of the unfavorable tax adjustment that I noted upfront. Average account values of $160 billion increased 16% year-over-year and 6% on a sequential basis, as equity market strength over the past year more than offset negative net flows. This contributed to a 7% increase in operating revenues in the quarter. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 18 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by noneconomic change in the spread calculation methodology. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 100 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid despite fewer fee days in the quarter with return on assets coming in at 72 basis points and return on equity at 22.9%. 
Risk metrics on the VA book continue to demonstrate the quality of our in-force business with the net amount at risk at 64 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 36 basis points for death benefits. Growing account values, a quality book of business and expense discipline are all indicators of strong future performance from the Annuity business. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $57 million compared to $40 million in the prior year quarter, driven by higher account values, expense management and favorable alternative investment performance, which more than offset spread compression and $2 million of the unfavorable tax adjustment. Deposits totaled $2.6 billion and net flows continue to be positive with $347 million in the quarter, consistent with recent periods. These positive flows, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values up 18% over the prior year quarter. 
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were down 4% compared to the prior year quarter, driving 320 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year quarter, back in line with our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold. The Retirement business started the year with strong results, including a 25 basis point ROA with continued momentum in flows and expense management serving as positive drivers going forward. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $107 million. While down from $171 million in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic, these results were solid and reflect strong underlying business drivers. This quarter's earnings included $132 million of excess pandemic-related mortality, partly offset by $59 million of favorable alternative investment experience. Underlying earnings drivers continued to show growth with average account values up 10% and average life insurance in-force, up 8% over the prior year. 
G&A expenses net amounts capitalized decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 60 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads declined 2 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, better than our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Outside of the impacts from the pandemic, the Life Insurance business had a strong quarter and key growth drivers remain positive. We expect pandemic headwinds to decline over the course of the year as vaccines are more widely rolled out. This combination of underlying growth and improving mortality results positions us nicely for improved results looking forward. 
Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $26 million compared to operating earnings of $40 million in the prior year quarter with the decrease driven by $90 million of pandemic-related claims, with 61 million of direct COVID-19 mortality; 7 million of morbidity and 22 million of indirect mortality. This was partially offset by $6 million of favorable alternative investment experience. The reported total loss ratio was 86.8% in the quarter, 1 percentage point better sequentially as an increase in the life loss ratio was more than offset by improvement in the disability loss ratio. 
Excluding pandemic-related claims from both periods, the total loss ratio was 76.6% for the quarter, down 2.3 percentage points sequentially. Expense ratio remained flat year-over-year as increases in G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized related to investments we have made in our [ claims ] organization were offset by premium growth. 
Excluding pandemic-related claims, the business had solid results which, as Dennis mentioned, put us back in the low end of our target margin range. While pandemic impacts continue to be a headwind, we are optimistic about the outlook for the business as improving unemployment rates coupled with vaccine rollouts should provide tailwinds going forward. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.7 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at 464%, up 13 percentage points from year-end. As a reminder, this includes 24 percentage points from noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end. Cash at the holding company stands at $758 million above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $105 million towards 5x this quarter, slightly above the $100 million we targeted. 
Given our strong capital position, improving capital market and health trends and our positive business outlook, we expect share repurchase in the second quarter to be approximately $150 million, in line with pre-pandemic levels. 
To conclude, this quarter's results included a large impact from COVID-19, but we expect these headwinds to abate over the remainder of the year. Looking past that, we see strong underlying earnings and several positives. Revenue growth in all 4 businesses, a positive outlook for sales looking forward, record end-of-period account provided a tailwind to earnings, continued strong expense discipline across the company and a strong capital position, which is contributing to our ability to invest in growth and increase our capital return to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

And probably we'll continue to have resources behind this kind of activity for some time. 
The other area that we're looking at is flow transactions. And just broadly speaking, and we've mentioned this a couple of times so you know this, we have done more or as many flow transactions, both in the living benefit space and in the fixed and annuity spaces most companies have. We, of course, have done a lot transaction already with the Fixed Annuity business. 
So we remain active, remain optimistic. There's a lot of participants in the marketplace. Randy, do you want to add to those comments, please?"

And we believe the in-force value is not fully reflected in our share price. And so that gives you the underlying thesis for why we are, as Dennis said, allocating significant resources to see if something makes up. So at least, we continue to be very interested in the idea and actively working on it. But I agree with Dennis, it's always difficult to talk about timing."

So can you just give us an update on when you might kind of get towards the upper end of that range? And I'm assuming that also assumes that once we get out of COVID, the indirect mortality, so the $22 million that you saw in the quarter that, that would all kind of go away and normalize once we're done with the pandemic?"

At least it's hard to predict exactly when that top end of the margin will be achieved. In my script, I said moving from 5% to 7% gradually. I mentioned a couple of initiatives underway, which -- some repricing going on as business comes up for renewal, strengthening pricing in some of our new business segments. Those take time to enter into the margin because it's new business, renewals for in-force business. So -- and then we have cost initiatives that are underway. Those also -- to do that type of thing effectively and to be able to get those numbers, somebody's name on them into our planning process where we can be confident that we achieve the expense savings. That takes time. 
So I think just over time without getting into a quantification of that. But it's going to build gradually. And so we're going to start seeing some of that improvement."

But we also know that this year in the first quarter, we had about $90 million of pandemic-related impact, right? So absent anything else happening, $40 million last year, new negative $90 million, you would have expected this to be around negative $50 million, and we outperformed that by about $24 million. 
About 1/4 of that is the strong performance I mentioned. But the other 3 quarters is improvement in underlying profitability of the business, and that's reflective of renewal price increases, the strong work of the claims team. We've talked about the investments we're making there. So that's an indication of what we can do in just a year's time. So I hope that helps, Elyse."

And so the question is, why do you believe that indirect component is related to the pandemic. It's really -- there are a number of aspects of that. The first thing we look at is just what is the nature of COVID-19. The nature of COVID-19 is that while it is more impactful than the flu, it acts like the flu and that it hits people with comorbidities harder. So that's just the nature of COVID-19. 
We also know that when we look inside of our experience, where this indirect component is coming, is coming in areas where you would expect the comorbidities to emerge, respiratory and cardiac, which is just like the flu. We also know that when it comes to comorbidities, it's oftentimes the case, and we see this with the flu. It's not -- flu is rarely noted on the death certificate as the cause of death, but it's oftentimes what starts the process. So everything that we know about COVID-19, all of our experience is what leads us to really assess this indirect component is related to the pandemic and something we believe will go away when we get this pandemic in behind us in the country."

But as Randy just said, have pretty large number of blocks on the Individual Life side that have value in them. Those blocks have the characteristic typically of the reserves being backed by our general account, and therefore, people who have asset capability would be buyers. So a lot of considerations, Tom.

But once again, what typically drives seasonality in the first quarter, the biggest driver is the flu. We believe, we read the same articles as you do, that it was a very light flu season.

If I step back and maybe add something to your question, which is out of guarantees in our individual businesses that we're running, you recall, it's been some time since we focus on this. But company focused on 70% of our business being non-guaranteed and maybe up to 30% guaranteed business, long-term liabilities. 
In the first quarter, long-term liabilities on the [indiscernible] non-guaranteed business was 19%. And that is really driven by pricing actions as interest rates drop, the value proposition or [indiscernible] benefits wasn't as strong as some of those sales go off a bit. So big picture, I don't think risk transfer is going to materially change the source of earnings number.

Lincoln had a strong start to the year against an improving but still challenging environment. We have continued to execute our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, manage expenses, improve the customer experience and maintain a strong balance sheet.  
First quarter earnings were affected by elevated pandemic-related claims in our Life and Group businesses, though this was partially offset by another quarter of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio. We are pleased with the earnings power Lincoln showed in the quarter and the outlook for our business is positive.  
Now let me touch on the major initiatives that are helping bolster our franchise and earnings power. First, as a result of our proactive and disciplined repricing actions, we are achieving targeted returns in each of our businesses. As a result of our reprice, shift and add new product strategy and the fact that several peers filed our repricing actions, our sales pipelines have begun to expand, and we expect continued sales recovery in the upcoming quarters.  
We're introducing 8 new products in the first half of this year, which increased consumer choice, broadened the product portfolio and enabled our participation in more market segments. Our new product strategy also gives us a great deal of optionality. If interest rates remain low, our newly launched products will remain attractive given their strong consumer value propositions driven by their innovative product design. If rates continue to rise, in addition to these newer products, some offerings already on our show would once again resonate with consumers, and that would also be beneficial to Lincoln's sales results.  
Second, we are focused on actions to increase productivity across our manufacturing, operations and distribution organizations while enhancing the customer and partner experience. We continue to report declining expense ratios in most of our businesses, while at the same time, investing in client-facing digital tools. Our demonstrated expense management capabilities will guide us as we start another meaningful expense savings program later this year.  
Third, we have successfully focused on improving the balance sheet. Both our RBC ratio and cash at the holding company have increased and remained above target, giving us the confidence to increase our share repurchase pace. Furthermore, as we evaluate risk transfer deals, we would expect for this to provide additional upside potential to our capital deployment if finalized.  
Now turning to the business segments. Starting with annuities. We continue to successfully leverage our industry-leading manufacturing capabilities to create new customer value propositions and expand our already broad product portfolio. Last year, we established ourselves as a leader in indexed variable annuities. This year, we are seeing growth in both IVAs and traditional variable annuities without living benefits, with total sales of nonliving benefit VAs up 44% versus the prior year quarter and 9% sequentially.  
Growth in these products, combined with continued market demand for guaranteed living benefits, led to total VA sales growth both versus the prior year quarter and sequentially. We had projected sales to begin the year at a similar pace to that seen in the fourth quarter and build over the course of the year as we benefit from products introduced both this year and last. And we are pleased to see that sales growth is ahead of our expected pace. In fact, this was the first quarter in a year that we saw sequential sales growth across all product categories in the Annuities business.  
While we experienced negative net flows in the quarter, this is a direct result of management's actions to maintain rigorous return standards and to allow us to continue to direct capital to the highest and best use. In 2021, we expect the earnings to continue to benefit from our high-quality in-force book that generates consistent cash flows and returns and provides excellent value for customers.  
In Retirement Plan Services, we once again reported strong results driven by our digitally optimized model. This model, where high tech enables high touch, differentiates us in the virtual environment. Our innovative product development capabilities are driving results, and we are excited about the continued success of our target date fund alternative, YourPath, as well as the recent launch of Income America, an innovative and simplified income solution for Retirement Plan participants.  
Although total deposits were down slightly compared to the very strong prior year quarter, we are optimistic looking forward given our robust sales pipeline. We reported positive net flows once again this quarter. And while flows can be lumpy, we expect this momentum to persist as we remain well positioned in our target markets. It was another excellent quarter for the retirement business, and we expect to benefit from the tailwinds of an improved economic backdrop, our ongoing investments in the customer experience, and our expanding set of solutions aimed at helping Americans secure their retirement.  
Within the Life Insurance business, we are positioning ourselves for growth through product innovation and distribution expansion. Sales in the quarter were flat, sequentially, but we expect will ramp up over the course of the year as we begin to reap the benefits of solutions we've recently launched into the market. 
We're seeing good momentum with some key new product rollouts. Our expanded VUL offerings continue to gain shelf space and our innovative MoneyGuard Market Advantage product is appealing to new market segments. Additionally, we are beginning to attract a broader range of advisers with nearly 1/4 being producers who had not previously sold a MoneyGuard product.  
These new products, coupled with our existing life offerings and the industry's strongest distribution force, position Lincoln for long-term success at attractive returns. Additionally, we are expanding our strong distribution network by adding our life insurance products to the shelf of a large P&C insurer where we have an existing annuity distribution partnership. We are seeing good early momentum, particularly with our TermAccel solution, which is a fully digital experience and is enabling us to reach a different customer segment.  
I'm pleased with the solid results the Life Insurance business reported. I'm also excited that Lincoln is introducing products with new value propositions that are resonating with customers and helping to drive future growth.  
Lastly, on Group Protections. Premiums rose more than 2% over the prior year quarter and nearly 7% sequentially, driven by improved persistency, price increases and organic growth resulting from the economic recovery. Sales in what is typically a seasonally smaller quarter were down versus the strong prior year quarter. However, underlying drivers were positive as 2/3 of our sales were employee paid products.  
As we communicated last quarter, we are taking actions to increase Group Protection margins. We are already seeing improved results as factors such as pricing actions, higher persistency and investments in our claim organization have put our margin, excluding the pandemic and excess alternative income, in the lower end of our targeted range. We continue to expect further expansion, building gradually towards the upper end of our 5% to 7% margin target.  
Briefly on investment results. As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio is performing quite well. Overall credit quality remains high and has continued to improve in recent years, driven by our high-quality new money purchases and proactive derisking. 96% of our fixed income assets are investment grade, with 59% rated A or higher. Our well-diversified commercial mortgage loan book has continued to perform well during the pandemic with virtually no credit losses and minimal loan modifications.  
Additionally, our alternatives performance was once again strong, driven by our portfolio construction that emphasized buyout and growth equity strategies, with a quarterly return of 8%, significantly exceeding our long-term target quarterly return of 2.5%. 
In closing, I would note, sales momentum is building at attractive returns, driven by new product introductions that resonate with our customer and expanded shelf space across distribution channels. Continued equity market tailwinds should boost earnings from fees on assets under management in the Annuities and RPS businesses. The outlook for the Life Insurance business is strong, as our new products are starting to take hold in the market. Group Protection's underlying profitability is experiencing an ongoing recovery.  
Expense savings initiatives will continue to contribute to earnings growth. And our robust balance sheet, high-quality investment portfolio, strong free cash flow generation and capital ratios, as well as the opportunity to execute risk transfer deals all leave Lincoln in an excellent position to fund expected sales growth while increasing our capital deployment. Based on these positive trends, 2021 is shaping up to be a successful year, and I expect will improve on this quarter's results. I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,709177097,2273082,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $350 million or $1.82 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items.",1255,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported first quarter adjusted operating income of $350 million or $1.82 per share. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, this quarter's result was impacted by a number of items.  
First, pandemic-related claims reduced earnings by $222 million or $1.15 per share. Second, results benefited from strong performance in the alternatives investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $84 million or $0.43 per share above target. Third, there was $11 million, or $0.06 per share of unfavorable tax adjustments. Finally, within the Other Operations segment, there was $11 million or $0.06 per share of expense variability related to elevated deferred compensation costs resulting from the increase in Lincoln share price during the quarter.  
Adding these items together, it was no doubt an extremely strong quarter that highlights our underlying earnings power. Net income totaled $225 million or $1.16 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income primarily being driven by $144 million noneconomic loss from variable annuity nonperformance risk. The VA hedge program performed exceptionally well with 99% effectiveness in the quarter.  
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating revenue increased 6%, with operating revenue growth in each of our 4 business segments. Average account values increased 15%. The expense ratio declined in all businesses, except Group Protection, where it remained flat. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, stands at $72.36, an all-time high.  
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $290 million compared to $261 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher account values driven by growth in the equity markets as favorable alternative investment income was offset by $9 million of the unfavorable tax adjustment that I noted upfront. Average account values of $160 billion increased 16% year-over-year and 6% on a sequential basis, as equity market strength over the past year more than offset negative net flows. This contributed to a 7% increase in operating revenues in the quarter.  
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 18 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by noneconomic change in the spread calculation methodology. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 3% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 100 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Return metrics remained solid despite fewer fee days in the quarter, with return on assets coming in at 72 basis points and return on equity at 22.9%.  
Risk metrics on the VA book continued to demonstrate the quality of our in-force business, with the net amount at risk at 64 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 36 basis points for death benefits. Growing account values, a quality book of business, and expense discipline are all indicators of strong future performance from the Annuity business.  
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $57 million compared to $40 million in the prior year quarter, driven by higher account values, expense management and favorable alternative investment performance, which more than offset spread compression and $2 million of the unfavorable tax adjustment. Deposits totaled $2.6 billion and net flows continue to be positive with $347 million in the quarter, consistent with recent periods. These positive flows, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values up 18% over the prior year quarter.  
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were down 4% compared to the prior year quarter, driving a 320 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year quarter, back in line with our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions take hold.  
The Retirement business started the year with strong results, including a 25 basis point ROA with continued momentum in flows and expense management serving as positive drivers going forward. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $107 million. While down from $171 million in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic, these results were solid and reflect strong underlying business drivers. This quarter's earnings included $132 million of excess pandemic-related mortality, partly offset by $59 million of favorable alternative investment experience. Underlying earnings drivers continued to show growth, with average account values up 10% and average life insurance in-force up 8% over the prior year.  
G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 2% from the prior year quarter, leading to a 60 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads declined 2 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, better than our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. Outside of the impacts from the pandemic, the Life Insurance business had a strong quarter and key growth drivers remain positive. We expect pandemic headwinds to decline over the course of the year as vaccines are more widely rolled out. This combination of underlying growth and improving mortality results positions us nicely for improved results looking forward.  
Group Protection reported a loss from operations of $26 million compared to operating earnings of $40 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease driven by $90 million of pandemic-related claims, with 61 million of direct COVID-19 mortality, 7 million of morbidity and 22 million of indirect mortality. This was partially offset by $6 million of favorable alternative investment experience. The reported total loss ratio was 86.8% in the quarter, 1 percentage point better sequentially as an increase in the life loss ratio was more than offset by improvement in the disability loss ratio.  
Excluding pandemic-related claims from both periods, the total loss ratio was 76.6% for the quarter, down 2.3 percentage points sequentially. Expense ratio remained flat year-over-year as increases in G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized related to investments we have made in our claims organization were offset by premium growth.  
Excluding pandemic-related claims, the business had solid results which, as Dennis mentioned, put us back in the low end of our target margin range. While pandemic impacts continue to be a headwind, we are optimistic about the outlook for the business as improving unemployment rates, coupled with vaccine rollouts, should provide tailwinds going forward.  
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.7 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at 464%, up 13 percentage points from year-end. As a reminder, this includes 24 percentage points from noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end. Cash at the holding company stands at $758 million, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $105 million towards 5x this quarter, slightly above the $100 million we targeted.  
Given our strong capital position, improving capital market and health trends and our positive business outlook, we expect share repurchase in the second quarter to be approximately $150 million, in line with pre-pandemic levels.  
To conclude, this quarter's results included a large impact from COVID-19, but we expect these headwinds to abate over the remainder of the year. Looking past that, we see strong underlying earnings and several positives. Revenue growth in all 4 businesses, a positive outlook for sales looking forward, record end-of-period account provided a tailwind to earnings, continued strong expense discipline across the company and a strong capital position, which is contributing to our ability to invest in growth and increase our capital return to shareholders.  
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

The other area that we're looking at is flow transactions. And just broadly speaking, and we've mentioned this a couple of times so you know this, we have done more or as many flow transactions, both in the Living Benefit space and in the fixed annuity spaces most companies have. We, of course, have done a lot transaction already with the Fixed Annuity business.

And we believe the in-force value is not fully reflected in our share price. And so that gives you the underlying thesis for why we are, as Dennis said, allocating significant resources to see if something makes sense. So at least, we continue to be very interested in the idea and actively working on it. But I agree with Dennis, it's always difficult to talk about timing."

In my script, I said moving from 5% to 7% gradually. I mentioned a couple of initiatives underway, which -- some repricing going on as business comes up for renewal, strengthening pricing in some of our new business segments. Those take time to enter into the margin because it's new business or renewals for the in-force business. So -- and then we have cost initiatives that are underway. Those also -- to do that type of thing effectively and to be able to get those numbers, somebody's name on them into our planning process where we can be confident that we achieve the expense savings, that takes time. 
So I think just over time, without getting into a quantification of that. But it's going to build gradually. And so we're going to start seeing some of that improvement."

So absent anything else happening, $40 million last year, new -- negative $90 million, you would have expected this to be around negative $50 million, and we outperformed that by about $24 million. 
About 1/4 of that is the strong alternatives performance I mentioned. But the other 3 quarters is improvement in underlying profitability of the business, and that's reflective of renewal price increases, the strong work of the claims team. We've talked about the investments we're making there. So that's an indication of what we can do in just a year's time. So I hope that helps, Elyse."

And so the question is, why do you believe that indirect component is related to the pandemic. And it's really -- there are a number of aspects of that. The first thing we look at is just what is the nature of COVID-19. The nature of COVID-19 is that while it is more impactful than the flu, it acts like the flu, and that it hits people with comorbidities harder. So that's just the nature of COVID-19. 
We also know that when we look inside of our experience, where this indirect component is coming, is coming in areas where you would expect the comorbidities to emerge, respiratory and cardiac, which is just like the flu. We also know that when it comes to comorbidities, it's oftentimes the case, and we see this with the flu. It's not -- flu is rarely noted on the death certificate as the cause of death, but it's oftentimes what starts the process.

And in terms of that view, there's not going to be a material change because of the transaction. If I step back and maybe add something to your question, which is out of guarantees in our individual businesses that we're running, you recall, it's been some time since we focus on this. But the company focused on 70 % of our business being non-guaranteed and maybe up to 30% guaranteed business, long-term liabilities. 
In the first quarter, long-term liabilities on the [10%] and non-guaranteed business was 19%. And that is really driven by pricing actions as interest rates drop, the value proposition or VA's living benefits wasn't as strong as some of those sales go off a bit. So big picture, I don't think risk transfer is going to materially change the source of earnings number. And we're considering, because I expect continuing to be in that guaranteed versus nonguaranteed range, better than the 70-30 for some time to come, again, driven by the level of interest rates, product designs and all the factors that go into the sales mix."

Dennis mentioned that we sort of bottomed in the first -- in the fourth quarter last year. Now we ended up in the first quarter this year with a number -- right in line with that number, and we expect to grow from here. Now what's driving that is new product introductions, but also changes that other -- some of our competitors are making in their pricing. And as we said, we believe we went in front of everybody else. 
When you think about the 2 big product introductions, for instance, that we had in the first quarter, the MoneyGuard Market Advantage, which is MoneyGuard on a variable platform, and then a reduced guarantee VUL product, the facts didn't roll out until the middle of February. And in fact, when you look at that MoneyGuard product, it's not on our 2 biggest MoneyGuard distribution partners yet, and it's already making us, by the way, about 30% of our submits. So we think we've hit the mark with those products, but it takes a while to get these things onto all the platforms you want. And then you'd ultimately really don't know the success on a Life product for probably 6 months before you really know whether you hit the mark. Hopefully that answers your question, Suneet."

I mentioned in my remarks, sort of separate from the new business that would -- the new products that we're putting out. And as Randy said, and if you said, there's certain amount of education, certain amount of shelf space that has to be acquired. In other parts of the business, some of the things that we've done in the past connected with expansion of distribution, we're seeing payoff sort of separate from that issue. And that's this large relationship they have with the -- I mentioned, with the P&C organization. And I just want to mention that because the app count, initially for that, although small facing now, has been pretty good. But the reason that we're able to be effective with that new partner, new partner for Life, is because of the investments that we've made in automated underwriting. 
So those sales are being digital or digital apps, digital underwriting and digital issue. And I'd just like to point out that we've been making these comments about our digital program from the cost perspective. But the digital program is really, as we go forward in many areas of the company, is going to permit us to not have to staff up because in the past, if you didn't have digital issue and apps and things like that, in order to improve your customer experience, you just have to add people. But we don't as much now because of the several hundred million dollars that we invested in digital."

Good morning, everyone. Lincoln had an excellent second quarter with record adjusted operating earnings per share and operating revenues and earnings growth in all 4 businesses. The impact of pandemic-related claims on earnings continues to",1729,"Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. Lincoln had an excellent second quarter with record adjusted operating earnings per share and operating revenues and earnings growth in all 4 businesses. The impact of pandemic-related claims on earnings continues to decline and was more than offset by another quarter of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio. Driving these results is the execution of our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, expense management and improving customer experience from digital and virtual enhancements and a strong balance sheet, providing room for increased share repurchases. 
Touching on each of these. First, our product introductions are adding new consumer value propositions, which open new market segments to us, further broadens our sales opportunities of an already strong base of products and increases our long-term sales growth potential. Our expanding shelf space and ongoing improvements in distribution productivity are effectively getting these new products into the hands of consumers, and we are achieving attractive new business returns on capital deployed. 
Second, we have a successful track record of increasing the expense efficiency of our product manufacturing, back-office operations and distribution functions while enhancing the customer and partner experience. This quarter, we reported lower expense ratios company-wide and in most of our businesses. As we've talked about recently, we are about to start on another program that will further improve efficiency and the customer experience and enable us to achieve meaningful savings. We'll be excited to provide you with more details next quarter. 
Third, our high-quality investment portfolio, higher statutory capital and RBC ratios, along with cash at the holding company and contingent capital, all provide capital deployment flexibility. 
Now turning to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. We have long been a leader in Annuities with a diversified crop portfolio that provides a broad range of customer value propositions. Total annuity sales this quarter were again strong as we grew 14% sequentially with growth across all product categories for the second quarter in a row and a good mix of product sales. 
Last year, we established ourselves as a leader in index variable annuities. This year, we are seeing growth in both index variable annuities and traditional VAs without living benefits. We also see ongoing market demand for VAs with guaranteed living benefits at attractive economics to Lincoln as protected income solutions continue to resonate with customers. 
We had projected total annuity sales to begin the year at a similar pace to what we saw in the fourth quarter then build over the course of the year, benefiting from shelf space we added last year and are adding this year, which is driving indexed variable annuity growth opportunities. We are pleased to see sales year-to-date ahead of our expectations. 
Looking forward, near-term sales may be impacted by typical summer seasonality, but we are confident that full year sales will remain ahead of our earlier expectations. 
Turning to flows. VA net flows were positive. And while we reported negative net fixed annuity flows, this is a direct result of past management actions taken to maintain rigorous return standards and allow us to direct capital to its highest and best use. We expect Annuities' earnings to continue to benefit from new sales, growing fees on AUM from the strong stock market and our diversified high-quality in-force book. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we once again reported excellent results and remain well positioned with scale in our markets of small and mid case 401(k), health care, government and not-for-profit, a broad suite of products, a competitive cost structure and award-winning digital technology. 
Total deposits were up 21% and included double-digit growth in both first year sales and recurring deposits. Sales continue to benefit from the success of path, our target date fund alternative. We have continued to innovate, introducing past builder income, which includes an income solution as part of a target date like investment option. This type of innovation will serve as a catalyst for future growth. 
Finally, we once again reported positive net flows. And while flows can be lumpy, we expect this positive momentum to persist. It was another outstanding quarter for the retirement business. We continue to excel in our target market segments as we benefit from our attractive competitive position, continued investments in the plan sponsor and planned participant experience and our expanding set of solutions aimed at helping people secure their retirement. 
Within the Life Insurance business, we continue to execute our product strategy that increases consumer value propositions while further diversifying our product risk profile. Our investment in new products further broadens our portfolio and supports shelf space expansion with new distribution partners, including in the P&C space. Complementing this expansion has been our continued focus on simplifying the client and adviser experience. 
Nearly all of our business is e-submitted and e-delivered, and our recently expanded online interview capabilities are resulting in higher placement rates at a lower cost per policy. This makes it easier for customers to do business with us and generates cost savings. 
Our strategies have taken hold and are driving double-digit sequential sales growth. By product category, Individual Life sales were up sequentially with growth seen in term life as well as across our expanded index UL, variable UL and MoneyGuard solutions. In addition, our executive benefit sales remained strong through the first half of the year, and we expect momentum to continue into the second half. I'm confident that actions we have taken will result in sequential sales growth, accelerating in the second half of the year as our new product offerings continue to garner additional shelf space supported by our industry-leading distribution. 
Lastly, on Group Protection, where we have been driving toward our target margin range of 5% to 7%. Our selective price increases as well as our successful efforts to raise persistency led to a 2% increase in premiums over the prior year period. 
Although sales in what is a seasonally smaller quarter were down versus the strong prior year quarter, we continue to have success expanding into higher-margin employee-paid products, which represented 56% of second quarter sales. Included within our employee-paid products is supplemental health insurance, where we will be adding a hospital indemnity solution, another example of Lincoln expanding our already broad portfolio of high-quality offerings. 
As we have communicated, we continue to take action to increase group protections, underlying operating margins. Excluding pandemic-related claims and excess alternative investment income, we are in the middle of our target range and expect further expansion over time as we drive premium growth, continue to invest in our claims organization and diligently manage expenses. 
A few words on one of our key competitive advantages are industry-leading distribution. As the industry evolves, the strength of our distribution franchise remains a constant. We are known in the marketplace for a consistent distribution presence with broad reach across channels as demonstrated by our recent life insurance shelf expansion with a large P&C insurer. Nearly 100,000 active producers, wholesalers, group representative consultants and other distribution professionals sell our products. And through strategic investments in technology and training, we have positioned ourselves to influence where and how we engage with our active producers, leading with a virtual first model for the long term. 
We already see this as the distribution teams begin meeting with their clients in person again while still leveraging virtual tools, both to improve the service we deliver and tightly manage our expenses. Our distribution team's productivity metrics are up, and our efforts are being recognized as we received 2 industry awards this quarter for innovation in virtual training and digital marketing. 
Briefly on investment results, credit quality remains excellent. Our general account portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which approximately 97% are investment grade. And within that, 59% are rated A equivalent or better. 
Examples of the underlying asset classes includes corporates, commercial mortgage loans and structured securities. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio is high quality, well diversified and continues to perform well, with nearly 100% of of loans in the 2 highest CML rating categories. And within that, 85% in the highest rating category and virtually no credit losses or loan modifications. Additionally, the structured securities are predominantly rated AA and higher with nearly no exposure to below investment-grade securities. 
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.7% with approximately 50% in shorter duration assets, reflecting our shorter duration product sales. 60% of our purchases were in investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and adding approximately 100 basis points of yield over comparably rated public corporates. 
Lastly, our alternatives performance was once again strong, driven by portfolio construction that has emphasized buyout and growth equity strategies with a 10% return in the quarter significantly exceeding our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%. 
In summary, our product strategy is helping sales momentum to build at attractive returns, driven by new product introductions, expanding shelf space and overall distribution strength. Group Protection margins are recovering. Expense savings initiatives will continue to contribute to earnings growth, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation and potential block sale transactions, all put Lincoln in an excellent position to fund sales growth while increasing our capital deployment. In short, we are very confident in our ability to continue to generate good earnings growth for shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Randy, a brief comment on how interest rate levels affect our business model. As we've mentioned before, low rates affect us in 3 principal ways: first, is product pricing and design and their impact on consumer demand; second, is spread compression; third, is the impact of cash flow testing on reserve requirements. 
Looking forward, first, as I've described this morning, our reprice shift and add new product strategy will provide us with sales growth opportunities in a variety of interest rate scenarios. Second, our focus on expenses, including the meaningful cost saving program, I mentioned earlier, is expected to replace all earnings lost to spread compression over the next few years. Third and finally, we have no significant cash flow testing reserve implications. 
In sum, low rates have already been with us for some time. And going forward, we expect to continue to meet or surpass our 8% to 10% long-term EPS growth target. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,1671824243,2364617,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $608 million or $3.17 per share, both record highs for Lincoln. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. Additionally, this quarter's result wa",1096,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $608 million or $3.17 per share, both record highs for Lincoln. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. Additionally, this quarter's result was impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $43 million or $0.22 per share. While results benefited from strong performance in the alternatives investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $113 million or $0.59 per share above target. It was an extremely strong quarter that highlights our underlying earnings power. 
Net income totaled $642 million or $3.34 per share, boosted by gains in the investment portfolio and excellent performance from the variable annuity hedge program. This quarter's record bottom line result was driven by strong top line performance with adjusted operating revenue up 16% from the prior year, which included growth in each of the 4 businesses and solid expense management as our expense ratio came down 130 basis points. 
Consistent with the record earnings, key financial metrics were excellent as adjusted operating return on equity came in at 17.3% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% and stands at $75.45, an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $323 million compared to $237 million in the prior year quarter. The quarter's earnings were driven by record average account values of $166 billion, up 24% over the past year and $12 million of favorable alternative investment income. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, decreased 7 basis points sequentially. Looking forward, we'd expect spreads to be in this range, trending up modestly over time. 
Expense ratio improved 110 basis points compared to the prior year period as our focus on expenses continues to benefit the bottom line. Return metrics remained solid with return on assets coming in at 78 basis points and return on equity at 25%. Risk metrics on the VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our in-force with a net amount of risk at 47 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 33 basis points for death benefits. Growing account values, a high-quality and high-return book of business and ongoing expense discipline are all indicators of strong future performance from the Annuities business. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $62 million compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results were driven by higher fees on account values and included $7 million of favorable alternative investment results. 
Total deposits of $2.8 billion helped drive $0.5 billion of net flows in the quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows of $1.6 billion, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values up 28% to $94 billion. The expense ratio improved 240 basis points over the prior year quarter as strong revenue growth combined with diligent expense management led to an increase in profitability. 
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed basis points versus the prior year quarter, better than our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions continue to take hold. Strong net flow performance and great expense management position our retirement business nicely moving forward. 
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $255 million versus a loss of $37 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings included $83 million of favorable alternative investment experience and a return to pre-pandemic levels of mortality as pandemic-related claims of $15 million were largely offset by favorable underlying mortality. 
Earnings drivers continue to grow with average account values up 12% and average Life Insurance in force up 7% over the prior year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, declined 7 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, in line with our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. The expense ratio improved 90 basis points over the prior year quarter as our efficiency efforts continue to benefit margins. The combination of accelerating sales, expense discipline and the declining impact from pandemic mortality positions us well for a strong second half of the year. 
Group Protection reported operating income of $46 million compared to $39 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings included $8 million of favorable alternative investment results. Compared to the first quarter, operating income rose from a loss of $26 million, driven primarily by improved pandemic-related claims of $28 million, down from $90 million sequentially. 
As Dennis noted, excluding pandemic claims and favorable alternative investment income, the group margin of 6.1% was in the middle of a 5% to 7% target range, an improvement from the first quarter. The loss ratio was 79.3% in the quarter, a 750 basis point sequential improvement. Excluding pandemic-related claims from both periods, loss ratio improved 50 basis points to 76.1% due to better loading results. 
Group's expense ratio rose 30 basis points year-over-year as we make ongoing investments in our claims organization to address elevated claim volume due to the pandemic. We expect the expense ratio to improve when the pandemic subsides, and we execute our ongoing expense savings initiatives. Growing operating revenues, coupled with improving underlying margin performance, have flipped the group business on much firmer footing looking forward. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at 483%. As a reminder, our RBC ratio includes 26 percentage points from noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end. 
We estimate C1 factor changes being implemented by the NAIC will negatively impact our year-end RBC ratio by approximately 15 percentage points. We are supportive of these factor changes and would note that they have no impact on our view of credit, and we expect them to change our capital deployment strategy. 
Cash at the holding company stands at $762 million, above our $450 million target, as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $150 million towards buybacks in the second quarter, in line with our goal communicated last quarter to return to pre-pandemic quarterly buyback levels. Supported by the strength of our balance sheet, we intend to repurchase up to $200 million of stock in the third quarter. This will position us to have full year buybacks in line with pre-pandemic levels. 
To conclude, we delivered excellent results with record earnings, book value, excluding AOCI and adjusted operating ROE. For all the reasons we discussed today, we feel great about continuing our excellent performance looking forward. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

And so we've seen a significant growth in our overall capital. I think our capital has grown roughly $1 billion year-to-date, and the RBC ratio itself has grown probably roughly 30 points since the beginning of the year. And I think the main driver of that is the underlying strength of the earnings that we just talked about. 
I think you do also see a little bit of benefit. Just we do benefit when the markets move, especially in our favor. So I think there's a lot of positive things under there, and those positive elements really what led us to announce getting back to really full year pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter, which means we'll do a couple of hundred million here in the third quarter. And I think that's really an indication of, for us, how we feel about the strength of our balance sheet, how we feel about the strength of our capital generation capabilities looking forward that we're back to those levels. 
I think in terms of what we think for the fourth quarter, for next year, I think we'll cross those bridges when we get there. But at this moment in time, we're in an extremely strong position, which will allow us to go out and buy it a little bit of an elevated rate in the third quarter."

And then going the other way, it was favorable to about So if you make those 2 adjustments, you're at $66 million. And that's what drives the 6.1% underlying margin. 
I didn't spike anything out in my script because I find the quarter relatively unremarkable in that every -- all the key drivers were sort of inside of sort of a normal confidence interval. So looking at disability, 3 big drivers, incidence, severity and resolutions. Incidence was right in line with our expectations. Severity went a little bit high, but resolutions were a little better than we expect. So I think the overall quarter itself, that $66 million underlying earnings par number, just very solid. And I really think really reflects really good performance. 
In terms of what takes it from 6.1% to the upper end of the range, I think it's -- that's only 1 point. I think it's probably -- the reality is that the combination of continued expense improvements.

Good morning, everyone. Lincoln had an excellent second quarter with record adjusted operating earnings per share and operating revenues and earnings growth in all 4 businesses. The impact of pandemic-related claims on earnings continues to",1727,"Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. Lincoln had an excellent second quarter with record adjusted operating earnings per share and operating revenues and earnings growth in all 4 businesses. The impact of pandemic-related claims on earnings continues to decline and was more than offset by another quarter of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio. Driving these results is the execution of our reprice, shift and add new product strategy, expense management and improving customer experience from digital and virtual enhancements and a strong balance sheet, providing room for increased share repurchases.  
Touching on each of these. First, our product introductions are adding new consumer value propositions, which open new market segments to us, further broadens our sales opportunities of an already strong base of products and increases our long-term sales growth potential. Our expanding shelf space and ongoing improvements in distribution productivity are effectively getting these new products into the hands of consumers, and we are achieving attractive new business returns on capital deployed.  
Second, we have a successful track record of increasing the expense efficiency of our product manufacturing, back-office operations and distribution functions, while enhancing the customer and partner experience. This quarter, we reported lower expense ratios company-wide and in most of our businesses. As we've talked about recently, we are about to start on another program that will further improve efficiency and the customer experience and enable us to achieve meaningful savings. We'll be excited to provide you with more details next quarter.  
Third, our high-quality investment portfolio, higher statutory capital and RBC ratios along with cash at the holding company and contingent capital, all provide capital deployment flexibility.  
Now turning to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. We have long been a leader in Annuities with a diversified portfolio that provides a broad range of customer value propositions. Total annuity sales this quarter were again strong as we grew 14% sequentially with growth across all product categories for the second quarter in a row and a good mix of product sales.  
Last year, we established ourselves as a leader in indexed variable annuities. This year, we are seeing growth in both index variable annuities and traditional VAs without living benefits. We also see ongoing market demand for VAs with guaranteed living benefits at attractive economics to Lincoln as protected income solutions continue to resonate with customers.  
We had projected total annuity sales to begin the year at a similar pace to what we saw in the fourth quarter then build over the course of the year, benefiting from shelf space we added last year and are adding this year, which is driving indexed variable annuity growth opportunities. We are pleased to see sales year-to-date ahead of our expectations.  
Looking forward, near-term sales may be impacted by typical summer seasonality, but we are confident that full year sales will remain ahead of our earlier expectations.  
Turning to flows. VA net flows were positive, and while we reported negative net fixed annuity flows, this is a direct result of past management actions taken to maintain rigorous return standards and allow us to direct capital to its highest and best use. We expect Annuities' earnings to continue to benefit from new sales, growing fees on AUM from the strong stock market and our diversified high-quality in-force book.  
In Retirement Plan Services, we once again reported excellent results and remain well positioned with scale in our target markets of small and mid case 401(k), health care, government and not-for-profit A broad suite of products, a competitive cost structure and award-winning digital technology.  
Total deposits were up 21% and included double-digit growth in both first-year sales and recurring deposits. Sales continue to benefit from the success of YourPath, our target date fund alternative. We have continued to innovate, introducing past builder income, which includes an income solution as part of a target date like investment option. This type of innovation will serve as a catalyst for future growth.  
Finally, we once again reported positive net flows. And while flows can be lumpy, we expect this positive momentum to persist. It was another outstanding quarter for the Retirement business. We continue to excel in our target market segments as we benefit from our attractive competitive position, continued investments in the planned sponsor and planned participant experience and our expanding set of solutions aimed at helping people secure their retirement.  
Within the Life Insurance business, we continue to execute our product strategy that increases consumer value propositions while further diversifying our product risk profile. Our investment in new products further broadens our portfolio and supports shelf space expansion with new distribution partners, including in the P&C space. 
Complementing this expansion has been our continued focus on simplifying the client and adviser experience. Nearly all of our business is e-submitted and e-delivered, and our recently expanded online interview capabilities are resulting in higher placement rates at a lower cost per policy. This makes it easier for customers to do business with us and generates cost savings.  
Our strategies have taken hold and are driving double-digit sequential sales growth. By product category, Individual Life sales were up sequentially with growth seen in term life as well as across our expanded Indexed UL, Variable UL and MoneyGuard solutions. 
In addition, our executive benefit sales remained strong through the first half of the year, and we expect momentum to continue into the second half. I'm confident that actions we have taken will result in sequential sales growth, accelerating in the second half of the year as our new product offerings continue to garner additional shelf space supported by our industry-leading distribution.  
Lastly, on Group Protection, where we have been driving toward our target margin range 5% to 7%. Our selective price increases as well as our successful efforts to raise persistency led to a 2% increase in premiums over the prior year period. Although sales in what is a seasonally smaller quarter were down versus the strong prior year quarter, we continue to have success expanding into higher-margin employee paid products, which represented 56% of second quarter sales. Included within our employee paid products is supplemental health insurance, where we will be adding a hospital indemnity solution, another example of Lincoln expanding our already broad portfolio of high-quality offerings.  
As we have communicated, we continue to take action to increase Group Protection's underlying operating margins, excluding pandemic-related claims and excess alternative investment income, we are in the middle of our target range and expect further expansion over time as we drive premium growth, continue to invest in our claims organization and diligently manage expenses.  
A few words on one of our key competitive advantages are industry-leading distribution. As the industry evolves, the strength of our distribution franchise remains a constant. We are known in the marketplace for a consistent distribution presence with broad reach across channels as demonstrated by our recent Life Insurance shelf expansion with a large P&C insurer. 
Nearly 100,000 active producers, wholesalers, group representative consultants and other distribution professionals sell our products. And through strategic investments in technology and training, we have positioned ourselves to influence where and how we engage with our active producers, leading with a virtual first model for the long term.  
We already see this as the distribution teams begin meeting with their clients in-person again while still leveraging virtual tools, both to improve the service we deliver and tightly manage our expenses. 
Our distribution team's productivity metrics are up, and our efforts are being recognized as we received 2 industry awards this quarter for innovation in virtual training and digital marketing.  
Briefly on investment results, credit quality remains excellent. Our general account portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which approximately 97% are investment grade. And within that, 59% are rated A, A equivalent or better. Examples of the underlying asset classes includes corporates, commercial mortgage loans and structured securities. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio is high quality, well diversified and continues to perform well, with nearly 100% of loans in the 2 highest CML rating categories. And within that, 85% in the highest rating category and virtually no credit losses or loan modifications.  
Additionally, the structured securities are predominantly rated AA and higher with nearly no exposure to below investment-grade securities.  
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.7% with approximately 50% in shorter duration assets, reflecting our shorter duration product sales. 60% of our purchases were in investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and adding approximately 100 basis points of yield over comparably rated public corporates.  
Lastly, our alternatives performance was once again strong, driven by portfolio construction that has emphasized buyout and growth equity strategies with a 10% return in the quarter, significantly exceeding our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%.  
In summary, our product strategy is helping sales momentum build at attractive returns, driven by new product introductions, expanding shelf space and overall distribution strength. Group Protection margins are recovering. Expense savings initiatives will continue to contribute to earnings growth, and our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation and potential block sale transactions, all put Lincoln in an excellent position to fund sales growth while increasing our capital deployment. In short, we are very confident in our ability to continue to generate good earnings growth for shareholders.  
Before I turn the call over to Randy, a brief comment on how interest rate levels affect our business model. As we've mentioned before, low rates affect us in 3 principal ways. First is product pricing and design and their impact on consumer demand; second, is spread compression; third, is the impact of cash flow testing on reserve requirements.  
Looking forward, first, as I've described this morning, our reprice shift and add new product strategy will provide us with sales growth opportunities in a variety of interest rate scenarios. 
Second, our focus on expenses, including the meaningful cost saving program, I mentioned earlier, is expected to replace all earnings lost to spread compression over the next few years. Third and finally, we have no significant cash flow testing reserve implications.  
In sum, low rates have already been with us for some time. And going forward, we expect to continue to meet or surpass our 8% to 10% long-term EPS growth target.  
I will now turn the call over to Randy."

Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $608 million or $3.17 per share, both record highs for Lincoln. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. Additionally, this quarter's result wa",1098,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $608 million or $3.17 per share, both record highs for Lincoln. There were no notable items in the current or prior year quarter. Additionally, this quarter's result was impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $43 million or $0.22 per share. While results benefited from strong performance in the alternatives investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $113 million or $0.59 per share above target. It was an extremely strong quarter that highlights our underlying earnings power.  
Net income totaled $642 million or $3.34 per share, boosted by gains in the investment portfolio and excellent performance from the variable annuity hedge program. This quarter's record bottom line result was driven by strong top line performance with adjusted operating revenue up 16% from the prior year, which included growth in each of the 4 businesses and a solid expense management as our expense ratio came down 130 basis points.  
Consistent with the record earnings, key financial metrics were excellent as adjusted operating return on equity came in at 17.3% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% and stands at $75.45, an all-time high.  
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $323 million compared to $237 million in the prior year quarter. The quarter's earnings were driven by record average account values of $166 billion, up 24% over the past year and $12 million of favorable alternative investment income. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, decreased 7 basis points sequentially. Looking forward, we'd expect spreads to be in this range, trending up modestly over time.  
Expense ratio improved 110 basis points compared to the prior year period as our focus on expenses continues to benefit the bottom line. Return metrics remained solid with return on assets coming in at 78 basis points and return on equity at 25%. Risk metrics on the VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our in-force with a net amount of risk at 47 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 33 basis points for death benefits.  
Growing account values, a high-quality and high-return book of business and ongoing expense discipline are all indicators of strong future performance from the Annuities business.  
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $62 million compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results were driven by higher fees on account values and included $7 million of favorable alternative investment results. 
Total deposits of $2.8 billion helped to drive $0.5 billion of net flows in the quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows of $1.6 billion combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values up 28% to $94 billion. The expense ratio improved 240 basis points over the prior year quarter as strong revenue growth combined with diligent expense management led to an increase in profitability.  
Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, comprised 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter, better than our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions continue to take hold. Strong net flow performance and great expense management position our retirement business nicely moving forward.  
Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $255 million versus a loss of $37 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings included $83 million of favorable alternative investment experience and a return to pre-pandemic levels of mortality as pandemic-related claims of $15 million were largely offset by favorable underlying mortality.  
Earnings drivers continue to grow with average account values up 12% and average Life Insurance in-force up 7% over the prior year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, declined 7 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, in line with our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. The expense ratio improved 90 basis points over the prior year quarter as our efficiency efforts continue to benefit margins. The combination of accelerating sales, expense discipline and the declining impact from pandemic mortality positions us well for a strong second half of the year.  
Group Protection reported operating income of $46 million compared to $39 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings included $8 million of favorable alternative investment results. Compared to the first quarter, operating income rose from a loss of $26 million, driven primarily by improved pandemic-related claims of $28 million, down from $90 million sequentially.  
As Dennis noted, excluding pandemic claims and favorable alternative investment income, the group margin of 6.1% was in the middle of a 5% to 7% target range, an improvement from the first quarter. The loss ratio was 79.3% in the quarter, a 750-basis point sequential improvement. Excluding pandemic-related claims from both periods, loss ratio improved 50 basis points to 76.1% due to better mortality results.  
Group's expense ratio rose 30 basis points year-over-year as we make ongoing investments in our claims organization to address elevated claim volume due to the pandemic. We expect the expense ratio to improve when the pandemic subsides, and we execute our ongoing expense savings initiatives. Growing operating revenues, coupled with improving underlying margin performance, have flipped the Group business on much firmer footing looking forward.  
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of statutory surplus and estimate our RBC ratio at 483%. As a reminder, our RBC ratio includes 26 percentage points from noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end.  
We estimate C1 factor changes being implemented by the NAIC will negatively impact our year-end RBC ratio by approximately 15 percentage points. We are supportive of these factor changes and would note that they have no impact on our view of credit nor do we expect them to change our capital deployment strategy.  
Cash at the holding company stands at $762 million, above our $450 million target, as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $150 million towards buybacks in the second quarter, in line with our goal communicated last quarter to return to pre-pandemic quarterly buyback levels. Supported by the strength of our balance sheet, we intend to repurchase up to $200 million of stock in the third quarter. This will position us to have full year buybacks in line with pre-pandemic levels.  
To conclude, we delivered excellent results with record earnings, book value, excluding AOCI and adjusted operating ROE. For all the reasons we discussed today, we feel great about continuing our excellent performance looking forward.  
With that, let me turn the call back over to Al."

And so we've seen a significant growth in our overall capital. I think our capital has grown roughly $1 billion year-to-date, and the RBC ratio itself has grown by roughly 30 points since the beginning of the year. And I think the main driver of that is the underlying strength of the earnings that we just talked about. 
I think you do also see a little bit of benefit. Just we do benefit when the markets move, move especially in our favor. So I think there's a lot of positive things under there, and those positive elements really what led us to announce getting back to really full year pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter, which means we'll do a couple of hundred million here in the third quarter. And I think that's really an indication of, for us, how we feel about the strength of our balance sheet, how we feel about the strength of our capital generation capabilities looking forward that were back to those levels. 
I think in terms of what we think for the fourth quarter, for next year, I think we'll cross those bridges when we get there. But at this moment in time, we're in an extremely strong position, which will allow us to go out and buy it a little bit of an elevated rate in the third quarter."

I didn't spike anything out in my script because I find the quarter relatively unremarkable. In that every -- all of the key drivers were sort of inside of sort of a normal confidence interval. So looking at disability, 3 big drivers, incidence, severity and resolutions. Incidence was right in line with our expectations. Severity went a little bit high, but resolutions were a little better than we expect. So I think the overall quarter itself, that $66 million underlying earnings par number is just very solid. And I really think really reflects really good performance. 
In terms of what takes it from 6.1% to the upper end of the range, I think it's -- that's only one point. I think it's probably -- the reality is that the combination of continued expense improvements. Dennis referenced another expense savings initiative and a little bit from underlying improvement in loss ratio.

So if you do the math there, the rules of thumb we've given you over the years, you would get about $0.10. And then we also know that we bought back a little over 1% of our shares. 
So [ $266 million ], while a lot would end up right up at the [ $280 million]  of underlying earnings power we had this quarter.

Good morning, everyone. Third quarter operating earnings were reduced by pandemic claims and other charges and helped by strong alternative investment results.

Third quarter operating earnings were reduced by pandemic claims and other charges and helped by strong alternative investment results. Adjusting out these various items, our underlying earnings and earnings growth potential remains strong. Our expectation remains to be at the high end or above our 8% to 10% EPS growth target in the intermediate and longer term. Intermediate term expectations are primarily based on recovering sales momentum, strong fees on assets under management, incremental expense management initiatives and the combination of $900 million of buybacks related to our recent block sale and ongoing share repurchases. 
Taking each of these in turn. Sales year-to-date are consistent with our expectations of building off the levels achieved as we exited 2020. We are also achieving returns in the low- to mid-teens on capital backing sales across all business lines. Overall, sales growth is reemerging due to our distribution strength, added shelf space, digital capabilities and product innovation. After introducing 10 new products since the beginning of the year, including the industry's first combined life plus long-term care policy built on a variable chassis, we have more updates planned and additional products in development. Expense efficiency has long been a key focus for Lincoln. This quarter, we once again reported a lower expense ratio across most of our businesses. 
We also have a track record of delivering on past cost savings initiatives. We expect Spark, our new cost savings initiative to drive savings well in excess of the impact of spread compression through 2024 and to improve both our operational effectiveness and the customer experience. 
Finally, our buyback strategy, as just mentioned, is comprised of 2 components: first, our ongoing repurchases, which returned to pre-COVID levels this year, driven by the capital efficiency of our products, including the impact of the recently announced VA living benefit flow reinsurance deal, low levels of credit losses and net ratings upgrades in our high-quality investment portfolio and our well-managed hedge strategy; second, the buybacks funded by the block deal. 
Before turning to the business segments, I want to congratulate Ellen Cooper. In August, the Board announced that Ellen will succeed me as CEO after our Annual Shareholders Meeting next May. Since joining Lincoln in 2012, Ellen has worked with me and the rest of our executive team to shape and execute on Lincoln's strategy. She joined us as Chief Investment Officer, and her responsibilities have grown to include leading our enterprise risk efforts and our annuities business. Ellen is a gifted leader with a proven track record of empowering high-performing teams and executing effectively in challenging environments. I know that Lincoln will be in great hands with Ellen at the helm as she moves forward and fully capitalizing on the exciting opportunities ahead for Lincoln. Ellen will be joining Randy and me on the first quarter's earnings call. 
Now turning to the business segments. In Annuities, we reported sales growth of 7% and over the prior year quarter, driven by our industry-leading product breadth and distribution force plus shelf space added over the last 2 years. Sales were down sequentially as we led the industry with weight reductions on index variable annuities in response to market conditions as well as typical third quarter seasonality. We remain pleased with our sales mix of guaranteed and nonguaranteed products, providing us diversification and attractive new business returns. Looking forward, we are expanding customer choice by adding new investment options and index strategies and have improved the attractiveness of our index variable annuity product setting us up for sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we expect our earnings to continue to benefit from the high-quality and diversified in-force book we have built over the years. 
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported another quarter of excellent results and remain well positioned with award-winning digital technology, a competitive cost structure an expanding set of product solutions and scale in our target markets. Total deposits were up 2% despite being negatively impacted by some sales shifting into the fourth quarter. While we reported slightly negative flows this quarter, trailing 12-month net flows remained strong at positive $1.2 billion, and we expect full year 2021 net flows to be positive. Sales of your path or alternative to target date funds remain strong. We have continued to innovate, enhancing our implant income solution called PathBuilder Income and integrating the solution inside our YourPath investment option. As a result of the Secure Act, we also see significant long-term opportunities around in-plan guarantees, pooled employer plan solutions and adviser managed accounts. 
Finally, the macro environment continues to provide a tailwind to Retirement Plan Services. In addition to healthy equity markets, the economic recovery is contributing to better wage growth, higher employee contribution rates and a greater employer deposits. The retirement business is having an outstanding year as we continue to execute on our strategy. 
In life insurance, our focus on expanding both consumer value propositions and distribution shelf space resulted in sequential sales growth of 32% this quarter with sales totaling $166 million and all product categories reporting double-digit increases. The focus on expanded customer choice aligns with our ongoing efforts to diversify our product risk profile. As examples, in the life business, our variable MoneyGuard and our principal VUL products offer the customer the choice of lower guarantees and higher upside potential. Sales of these types of products have been growing faster than segment-wide sales. The products have less potential tail risk and better capital efficiency. In addition to the property and casualty distribution partnership we added in the second quarter -- We recently launched our variable MoneyGuard product at 2 of our largest strategic partners, providing 25,000 more advisers with access to this first-of-its-kind solution. 
Complementing our distribution and product expansion efforts, our digital-first focus continues to drive a lower cost per policy and an improved customer experience. Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about the future of the life business, we are introducing new solutions that will further expand our customer and distribution reach with more introductions planned for the first half of 2022. 
Lastly, our Group Protection business continues to be impacted by the pandemic particularly as the Delta variant affected more individuals under age 65 driving increased claims. While the pandemic continues to be a headwind, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We achieved 5% premium growth over the prior year which is a result of a stronger persistency rate of nearly 90% and renewal rate increases implemented earlier this year. Year-over-year sales are flat as we stick to our pricing discipline. We're seeing more sales from our higher-margin employee-paid products year-to-date. 59% of Group Protection sales have come from these products as more individuals see the value of them. Within this category, we have begun to quote our new hospital indemnity product rounding out our suite of supplemental health products. 
Underlying margins after adjusting primarily for pandemic-related claims or again, in the middle of our target range this quarter. We will continue to build on our progress and expect margins to grow towards the top end of our 5% to 7% target range. As we remain disciplined on pricing, new business, reducing costs and managing claims. 
Briefly on investment results. Credit quality remains excellent. Our general account portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which 97% are investment-grade equivalent. We continue to expect a benign credit outlook and have seen favorable credit trends within our portfolio with minimal credit losses and positive net credit migrations. During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.6% with 1/2 in shorter-duration assets versus 1/3 for the full year 2020. And reflecting the increase in shorter-duration product sales and our disciplined asset liability matching. Approximately 60% of our purchases were in investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and yielding approximately 100 basis points over comparability rated public corporates. 
Lastly, our alternative investment performance was once again strong with an 8% return in the quarter, exceeding our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%. 
In summary, reported results this quarter continue to reflect ongoing impacts from the pandemic in life insurance and Group Protection. Our product strategy, distribution strength and ongoing innovation are helping to build sales momentum at attractive returns. Our new expense savings initiative is expected to more than offset spread compression, improve overall operational effectiveness and drive earnings growth. And ongoing share buybacks driven by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, combined with the incremental buybacks enabled by our recent block deal will further boost EPS. In sum, our underlying earnings power is improving, and we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at or above our 8% to 10% target range. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,1682775841,2425134,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted operating income of $307 million or $1.62 per share. As noted in the earnings release, adjusted operating income included net unfavorable notable items of $108 million or $0.57 per share, i",1945,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted operating income of $307 million or $1.62 per share. As noted in the earnings release, adjusted operating income included net unfavorable notable items of $108 million or $0.57 per share, including $93 million from legal-related expenses and a $15 million net charge from this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Also, -- This quarter's results were impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $180 million or $0.95 per share. While results benefited from strong performance in the alternative investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $89 million or $0.47 per share above target. 
Additionally, we experienced some unfavorable nonpandemic mortality in the Life Insurance segment that I will discuss further in the life commentary. From a reported adjusted operating income standpoint, it was a bit of a noisy quarter, but we have strong underlying earnings power as we exit the quarter. Net income totaled $318 million or $1.68 per share, boosted by gains in the investment portfolio and strong performance from the variable annuity hedge program. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Consolidated adjusted operating revenue grew 9% from the prior year, which included growth in each of the 4 businesses. Average account values increased 17%, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% and stands at $76.96, an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $338 million, which included a $5 million net unfavorable impact from our annual review.  Compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $101 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income increased 15% from the prior year quarter, driven by record average account values of $170 billion, up 17% over the past year. The current quarter included $10 million of favorable alternative investment income. The expense ratio improved 80 basis points compared to the prior year period as our focus on expenses continues to benefit the bottom line. 
Return metrics remained solid with return on assets coming in at 80 basis points and return on equity at 26%. Risk metrics on our VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our in-force with a net amount at risk at 63 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 43 basis points for death benefits. So a great result for the Annuities business with another quarter of high-quality earnings, strong returns and solid risk metrics, leaving us well positioned to finish the year with another excellent quarter. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $60 million compared to $50 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase driven by higher fees and account values, continued expense efficiency and higher alternative investment income, which was $6 million favorable to our expectation in the current quarter. Our annual review had no impact in the current quarter, but did have a net unfavorable impact of $3 million in the prior year quarter. Favorable equity markets drove average account values up 21% to $97 billion. The expense ratio improved 80 basis points over the prior year quarter as revenue growth combined with continued diligent expense management contributed to improved results. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions continue to take hold. Overall, the retirement business had an excellent quarter, and continues to be well positioned to drive strong results. 
Turning to life Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $93 million which included a $26 million net unfavorable impact from our annual review compared to an operating loss of $311 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $440 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. Additionally,  the current quarter included an unfavorable notable item of $19 million related to a legal expense associated with the reinsurance arbitration award. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income increased 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher alternative investment income,as the current quarter included $65 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter. Elevated mortality related to the pandemic was $60 million in the quarter compared to $70 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's impact for 10,000 COVID deaths of $6 million was down year-over-year as expected, but was up sequentially and as the severity of our average cover claim was elevated. We believe this elevation is normal volatility as we had a few larger COVID claims in the quarter. 
In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, underlying mortality was negatively impacted by $34 million. We believe this was driven by 2 factors. First, over the course of the pandemic, when COVID cases have been increasing, which they did in the third quarter, we have seen elevated non-COVID mortality as well. And second, normal quarterly volatility. I'd point out that we experienced favorable underlying mortality in the prior 2 quarters, and when viewed on a year-to-date basis, our actual to expected mortality ratio remain under 100% better than expected. Earnings drivers continue to grow, with average account values up 9% and average life insurance in-force up 7% over the prior year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, declined 13 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, above our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. 
Our expense ratio improved 30 basis points over the prior year quarter as our efficiency efforts continue to benefit margins. This was a noisy quarter for life earnings, but growth in earnings drivers, long-term mortality results in line with expectations and continued expense discipline keep us confident in our underlying business. 
Group Protection reported an operating loss of $32 million which included a $16 million net favorable impact from our annual review of reserve assumptions compared to operating income of $6 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $3 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income decreased from $9 million to an operating loss of $48 million, driven by higher mortality impact from the pandemic. The current quarter also included $6 million of favorable alternative investment income. On a sequential basis, pandemic-related claims in the quarter negatively impacted earnings by $120 million compared to $28 million in the second quarter and included $107 million in life claims and $13 million in disability claims. 
In the quarter, U.S. COVID deaths significantly shifted to the working age population, and in our group business, the average claim size for active employees across all ages is consistently 3 to 4x the size of those for retirees. This significant increase in working age deaths, coupled with the higher average claim size, drove the sequential increase in mortality. While I've been humbled by trying to predict the impacts of the pandemic, I do believe that this quarter's increased impact reflects the current state of the pandemic, with a higher percentage of deaths occurring in the working-age population. Excluding the annual review of reserve assumptions, pandemic claims and favorable alternative investment income, the group margin of 5.9% was consistent with the prior quarter and in the middle of our 5% to 7% targeted range. 
The loss ratio was 87.8% in the quarter, an 8.5 percentage point sequential increase. Excluding pandemic-related claims and the impact of the assumption review, the loss ratio improved 20 basis points to 75.9%. Groups' expense ratio remained flat despite ongoing investments in our claims organization to address elevated claim volume from the pandemic. Despite the tough quarter for group, we are confident that the underlying business fundamentals are solid and the strength of this business will reemerge that the pandemic subsides. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.9 billion of statutory capital and estimate our RBC ratio at 63%. As a reminder, our RBC ratio includes 25 percentage points from noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end. Cash at the holding company stands at $754 million, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $200 million towards buybacks in the third quarter. In line with our goal communicated last quarter to have full year buybacks in line with pre-pandemic levels of approximately $600 million, excluding any incremental buybacks from transactions. 
Our block sale with Resolution Life, which we announced in September and closed on October 1, generated approximately $1.2 billion of capital. $900 million of which we plan to use for incremental share repurchases. We expect these repurchases to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022 and began the incremental buybacks in October, via a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Outside of the deployment of proceeds from the block sale, we expect to continue our ongoing buyback program. Although I'd point out that the timing of ongoing buybacks may be influenced by the accelerated share repurchase program. We were pleased to have executed both a life block deal and a VA flow deal last quarter, and we continue to be open to additional block and flow reinsurance deals. 
Additionally, we announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend this quarter. Now to provide some details on the Spark initiative. As we have been communicating for the past few quarters,  we are excited to be embarking on another meaningful expense savings program. Teams from across the organization has been hard at work identifying and prioritizing opportunities for us to invest and improve efficiencies through this initiative. And they have been working with them and across departments to identify the best project to maximize effectiveness as part of Spark. Because the strategic digital program is nearing its end,  we have decided to integrate the balance of that program into this new cost savings initiatives for ease of tracking and communication. As of the end of 2020, the total net recurring benefit from our strategic digital program is $80 million, on track with our target. 
In addition to these savings, we expect to achieve $260 million to $300 million in run rate savings through Spark as we exit 2024, with benefits growing steadily starting this year, and ramping up in the out years. The total expected onetime investment to achieve the savings is $350 million to $410 million including the $57 million in investments we've made already this year. We expect investment spend to peak in 2022 and decline in subsequent years. 
All numbers that I've just discussed are pretax and pre-DAC. Spark will be focused on driving efficiencies throughout all aspects of our business, from leveraging automation to simplifying and improving process efficiency. And we will continue to focus on enhancing the customer and employee experiences while modernizing our technology footprint. We are also targeting benefits beyond cost savings, including improving the way we work by focusing on reskilling and upskilling our valuable employee base. A detailed breakdown of the benefits, investments and net impact for 2021 through 2025 from Spark combined with the remainder of the strategic, the digital initiative can be found in this quarter's press release. We will update you on our progress going forward, tying back to this disclosure. 
To conclude, the pandemic environment continues to challenge our life Insurance and Group Protection segments. However, underlying earnings in these businesses remains strong. Our Annuities and Retirement businesses both delivered excellent results. In sum, our underlying results and earnings power are both strong and growing.

I think, as I said in my script, when it comes to the group business, we think that the results we saw in this quarter reflect the state of the current pandemic, which is that deaths are occurring more frequently in the working age population. If you look at the numbers, it's pretty pronounced this quarter, we use CDC data here, 40% of the 100,000 or so COVID deaths were in the working age population. And in previous quarters, pretty consistently, that had been between 15% and 20%. So you've seen a pretty dramatic shift. I don't know of any reason why that shift should not continue into the fourth quarter. 
So I think what you saw in the group business reflects the state of a pandemic today, even though we do believe that the impact of the pandemic, right, the number of people dying should continue to trend down over time as  immunizations, both natural and the vaccination continue to increase over time. 
On the life side, we think of the impact, which was largely driven by severity this time is more random, pretty consistently over the first 5 quarters or so of the pandemic the average COVID claim we saw is right in the $130,000, $140,000 range. And this quarter was simply an outlier. The average COVID claim this quarter was about $260,000 and there's really no example of that sort of impact in any preceding quarter. So I think of it as more random this quarter in the Life business, really driven by a few large claims that we sell. Hope that helps me."

If you compare to 2021, where we had net incremental benefits of $50 million, and we're anticipating we'll have roughly $75 million of investments this year for a negative $25 million impact. We'd expect that net impact to roughly grow by -- if I use the midpoint, roughly $20 million next year. So a relatively modest incremental negative. 
When you think about the outer years, we ultimately expect the net benefit to grow to the $260 million to $300 million range. So a pretty substantial impact across the organization and something that will be very supportive and why Dennis and us, we're very confident we talk about our ability to grow at or above the top of the end of our 8% to 10% Crane.

And part of this is investing in ongoing development growth for our employees. So these enhancements across the company, they will improve the customer experience and as Randy has just mentioned, will have a positive impact on our bottom line over time. And I want to mention on this, and I mentioned in my remarks that we have a good track record. When we get to the point where we share this information with the investor groups that we pretty much nailed down the framework here and all of the investments that we need there's a name behind it. There's an outcome tied to it. We put it into our financial plans. So we're pretty excited. And so you can see it's across the businesses, and some of it, for example, is coming of our IT department, cost reductions inside the IT department, take on new ways of doing business then those cost reductions will flow into all of the businesses.

So incidents has come down very nicely as we've talked about pretty heavy vaccination among the population that we insure in the individual life business. So incidence has come down substantially. And what you're going to see now is the impact is driven by severity. We do see this particular quarter the average COVID claim of $250,000 as an outlier. It's way out of whack with any of the preceding 5 quarters. So we do expect severity to come back down. But once again, you could get some volatility if you get a couple of big claims. But we do expect that to come down and revert more to what we've experienced over the first 5 quarters or so of this pandemic time."

Intermediate term expectations are primarily based on recovering sales momentum, strong fees on assets under management, incremental expense management initiatives and the combination of $900 million of buybacks related to our recent block sale and ongoing share repurchases.  
Taking each of these in turn. Sales year-to-date are consistent with our expectations of building off the levels achieved as we exited 2020. We are also achieving returns in the low- to mid-teens on capital backing sales across all business lines. Overall, sales growth is reemerging due to our distribution strength, added shelf space, digital capabilities and product innovation. 
After introducing 10 new products since the beginning of the year, including the industry's first combined life plus long-term care policy built on a variable chassis, we have more updates planned and additional products in development. 
Expense efficiency has long been a key focus for Lincoln. This quarter, we once again reported a lower expense ratio across most of our businesses. We also have a track record of delivering on past cost savings initiatives. We expect Spark, our new cost savings initiative to drive savings well in excess of the impact of spread compression through 2024 and to improve both our operational effectiveness and the customer experience.  
Finally, our buyback strategy, as just mentioned, is comprised of 2 components: first, our ongoing repurchases, which returned to pre-COVID levels this year, driven by the capital efficiency of our products, including the impact of the recently announced VA living benefit flow reinsurance deal, low levels of credit losses and net ratings upgrades in our high-quality investment portfolio and our well-managed hedge strategy. Second, the buybacks funded by the block deal. 
Before turning to the business segments, I want to congratulate Ellen Cooper. In August, the Board announced that Ellen will succeed me as CEO after our Annual Shareholders Meeting next May. Since joining Lincoln in 2012, Ellen has worked with me and the rest of our executive team to shape and execute on Lincoln's strategy. 
She joined us as Chief Investment Officer, and her responsibilities have grown to include leading our enterprise risk efforts and our annuities business. Ellen is a gifted leader with a proven track record of empowering high-performing teams and executing effectively in challenging environments. 
I know that Lincoln will be in great hands with Ellen at the helm as she moves forward and fully capitalizing on the exciting opportunities ahead for Lincoln. Ellen will be joining Randy and me on the first quarter's earnings call.  
Now turning to the business segments. In Annuities, we reported sales growth of 7% and over the prior year quarter, driven by our industry-leading product breadth and distribution force plus shelf space added over the last 2 years. Sales were down sequentially as we led the industry with weight reductions on indexed variable annuities in response to market conditions as well as typical third quarter seasonality. 
We remain pleased with our sales mix of guaranteed and nonguaranteed products, providing us diversification and attractive new business returns. Looking forward, we are expanding customer choice by adding new investment options and index strategies and have improved the attractiveness of our indexed variable annuity product setting us up for sales growth in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect our earnings to continue to benefit from the high-quality and diversified in-force book we have built over the years.  
In Retirement Plan Services, we reported another quarter of excellent results and remain well positioned with award-winning digital technology, a competitive cost structure an expanding set of product solutions and scale in our target markets. Total deposits were up 2% despite being negatively impacted by some sales shifting into the fourth quarter. 
While we reported slightly negative flows this quarter, trailing 12-month net flows remained strong at positive $1.2 billion, and we expect full year 2021 net flows to be positive. Sales of YourPath or alternative to target date funds remain strong. We have continued to innovate, enhancing our in-plan income solution called PathBuilder Income and integrating the solution inside our YourPath investment option. As a result of the SECURE Act, we also see significant long-term opportunities around in-plan guarantees, pooled employer plan solutions and adviser managed accounts.  
Finally, the macro environment continues to provide a tailwind to Retirement Plan Services. In addition to healthy equity markets, the economic recovery is contributing to better wage growth, higher employee contribution rates and a greater employer deposits. The retirement business is having an outstanding year as we continue to execute on our strategy.  
In life insurance, our focus on expanding both consumer value propositions and distribution shelf space resulted in sequential sales growth of 32% this quarter with sales totaling $166 million and all product categories reporting double-digit increases. The focus on expanded customer choice aligns with our ongoing efforts to diversify our product risk profile. 
As examples, in the life business, our variable MoneyGuard and our principal VUL products offer the customer the choice of lower guarantees and higher upside potential. Sales of these types of products have been growing faster than segment-wide sales. The products have less potential tail risk and better capital efficiency. 
In addition to the property and casualty distribution partnership we added in the second quarter -- We recently launched our variable MoneyGuard product at 2 of our largest strategic partners, providing 25,000 more advisers with access to this first-of-its-kind solution.  
Complementing our distribution and product expansion efforts, our digital-first focus continues to drive a lower cost per policy and an improved customer experience. Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about the future of the life business, we are introducing new solutions that will further expand our customer and distribution reach with more introductions planned for the first half of 2022.  
Lastly, our Group Protection business continues to be impacted by the pandemic particularly as the Delta variant affected more individuals under age 65 driving increased claims. While the pandemic continues to be a headwind, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. 
We achieved 5% premium growth over the prior year which is a result of a stronger persistency rate of nearly 90% and renewal rate increases implemented earlier this year. Year-over-year sales are flat as we stick to our pricing discipline. We're seeing more sales from our higher-margin employee-paid products year-to-date. 59% of Group Protection sales have come from these products as more individuals see the value of them. 
Within this category, we have begun to quote our new hospital indemnity product rounding out our suite of supplemental health products. Underlying margins after adjusting primarily for pandemic-related claims or again, in the middle of our target range this quarter. We will continue to build on our progress and expect margins to grow towards the top end of our 5% to 7% target range. As we remain disciplined on pricing, new business, reducing costs and managing claims. 
Briefly on investment results. Credit quality remains excellent. Our general account portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which 97% are investment-grade equivalent. We continue to expect a benign credit outlook and have seen favorable credit trends within our portfolio with minimal credit losses and positive net credit migrations. 
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.6% with 1/2 in shorter-duration assets versus 1/3 for the full year 2020. And reflecting the increase in shorter-duration product sales and our disciplined asset liability matching. Approximately 60% of our purchases were in investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and yielding approximately 100 basis points over comparability rated public corporates. 
Lastly, our alternative investment performance was once again strong with an 8% return in the quarter, exceeding our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%. 
In summary, reported results this quarter continue to reflect ongoing impacts from the pandemic in life insurance and Group Protection. Our product strategy, distribution strength and ongoing innovation are helping to build sales momentum at attractive returns. Our new expense savings initiative is expected to more than offset spread compression, improve overall operational effectiveness and drive earnings growth. And ongoing share buybacks driven by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, combined with the incremental buybacks enabled by our recent block deal will further boost EPS. In sum, our underlying earnings power is improving, and we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at or above our 8% to 10% target range. 
I will now turn the call over to Randy."
867423,1682775841,2425473,"Lincoln National Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Lincoln National Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted operating income of $307 million or $1.62 per share. As noted in the earnings release, adjusted operating income included net unfavorable notable items of $108 million or $0.57 per share, i",1945,"Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted operating income of $307 million or $1.62 per share. As noted in the earnings release, adjusted operating income included net unfavorable notable items of $108 million or $0.57 per share, including $93 million from legal-related expenses and a $15 million net charge from this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. 
Also, this quarter's results were impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $180 million or $0.95 per share. While results benefited from strong performance in the alternative investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $89 million or $0.47 per share above target. 
Additionally, we experienced some unfavorable nonpandemic mortality in the Life Insurance segment that I will discuss further in the life commentary. From a reported adjusted operating income standpoint, it was a bit of a noisy quarter, but we have strong underlying earnings power as we exit the quarter. Net income totaled $318 million or $1.68 per share, boosted by gains in the investment portfolio and strong performance from the variable annuity hedge program. 
Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Consolidated adjusted operating revenue grew 9% from the prior year, which included growth in each of the 4 businesses. Average account values increased 17%, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% and stands at $76.96, an all-time high. 
Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $338 million, which included a $5 million net unfavorable impact from our annual review. Compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $101 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. 
Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income increased 15% from the prior year quarter, driven by record average account values of $170 billion, up 17% over the past year. The current quarter included $10 million of favorable alternative investment income. The expense ratio improved 80 basis points compared to the prior year period as our focus on expenses continues to benefit the bottom line. 
Return metrics remained solid with return on assets coming in at 80 basis points and return on equity at 26%. Risk metrics on our VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our in-force with a net amount at risk at 63 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 43 basis points for death benefits. So a great result for the Annuities business with another quarter of high-quality earnings, strong returns and solid risk metrics, leaving us well positioned to finish the year with another excellent quarter. 
Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $60 million compared to $50 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase driven by higher fees and account values, continued expense efficiency and higher alternative investment income, which was $6 million favorable to our expectation in the current quarter. 
Our annual review had no impact in the current quarter, but did have a net unfavorable impact of $3 million in the prior year quarter. Favorable equity markets drove average account values up 21% to $97 billion. The expense ratio improved 80 basis points over the prior year quarter as revenue growth combined with continued diligent expense management contributed to improved results. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions continue to take hold. Overall, the retirement business had an excellent quarter, and continues to be well positioned to drive strong results. 
Turning to life Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $93 million which included a $26 million net unfavorable impact from our annual review compared to an operating loss of $311 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $440 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. Additionally,  the current quarter included an unfavorable notable item of $19 million related to a legal expense associated with the reinsurance arbitration award. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income increased 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher alternative investment income, as the current quarter included $65 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter. 
Elevated mortality related to the pandemic was $60 million in the quarter compared to $70 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's impact for 10,000 COVID deaths of $6 million was down year-over-year as expected, but was up sequentially and as the severity of our average COVID claim was elevated. We believe this elevation is normal volatility as we had a few larger COVID claims in the quarter. 
In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, underlying mortality was negatively impacted by $34 million. We believe this was driven by 2 factors. First, over the course of the pandemic, when COVID cases have been increasing, which they did in the third quarter, we have seen elevated non-COVID mortality as well. And second, normal quarterly volatility. I'd point out that we experienced favorable underlying mortality in the prior 2 quarters, and when viewed on a year-to-date basis, our actual to expected mortality ratio remains under 100%, better than expected. 
Earnings drivers continue to grow, with average account values up 9% and average life insurance in-force up 7% over the prior year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, declined 13 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, above our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. 
Our expense ratio improved 30 basis points over the prior year quarter as our efficiency efforts continue to benefit margins. This was a noisy quarter for life earnings, but growth in earnings drivers, long-term mortality results in line with expectations and continued expense discipline keep us confident in our underlying business. 
Group Protection reported an operating loss of $32 million which included a $16 million net favorable impact from our annual review of reserve assumptions compared to operating income of $6 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $3 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. 
Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income decreased from $9 million to an operating loss of $48 million, driven by higher mortality impact from the pandemic. The current quarter also included $6 million of favorable alternative investment income. On a sequential basis, pandemic-related claims in the quarter negatively impacted earnings by $120 million compared to $28 million in the second quarter and included $107 million in life claims and $13 million in disability claims. 
In the quarter, U.S. COVID deaths significantly shifted to the working age population, and in our group business, the average claim size for active employees across all ages is consistently 3 to 4x the size of those for retirees. This significant increase in working age deaths, coupled with the higher average claim size, drove the sequential increase in mortality. While I've been humbled by trying to predict the impacts of the pandemic, I do believe that this quarter's increased impact reflects the current state of the pandemic, with a higher percentage of deaths occurring in the working-age population. Excluding the annual review of reserve assumptions, pandemic claims and favorable alternative investment income, the group margin of 5.9% was consistent with the prior quarter and in the middle of our 5% to 7% targeted range. 
The loss ratio was 87.8% in the quarter, an 8.5 percentage point sequential increase. Excluding pandemic-related claims and the impact of the assumption review, the loss ratio improved 20 basis points to 75.9%. Group's expense ratio remained flat despite ongoing investments in our claims organization to address elevated claim volume from the pandemic. 
Despite the tough quarter for group, we are confident that the underlying business fundamentals are solid and the strength of this business will reemerge as the pandemic subsides. 
Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $10.9 billion of statutory capital and estimate our RBC ratio at 63%. As a reminder, our RBC ratio includes 25 percentage points from noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end. 
Cash at the holding company stands at $754 million, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $200 million towards buybacks in the third quarter. In line with our goal communicated last quarter to have full year buybacks in line with pre-pandemic levels of approximately $600 million, excluding any incremental buybacks from transactions. 
Our block sale with Resolution Life, which we announced in September and closed on October 1, generated approximately $1.2 billion of capital, $900 million of which we plan to use for incremental share repurchases. We expect these repurchases to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022 and began the incremental buybacks in October, via a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. 
Outside of the deployment of proceeds from the block sale, we expect to continue our ongoing buyback program. Although I'd point out that the timing of ongoing buybacks may be influenced by the accelerated share repurchase program. We were pleased to have executed both a life block deal and a VA flow deal last quarter, and we continue to be open to additional block and flow reinsurance deals. 
Additionally, we announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend this quarter. Now to provide some details on the Spark initiative. As we have been communicating for the past few quarters, we are excited to be embarking on another meaningful expense savings program. Teams from across the organization have been hard at work identifying and prioritizing opportunities for us to invest and improve efficiencies through this initiative. 
And they have been working with them and across departments to identify the best project to maximize effectiveness as part of Spark. Because the strategic digital program is nearing its end,  we have decided to integrate the balance of that program into this new cost savings initiatives for ease of tracking and communication. As of the end of 2020, the total net recurring benefit from our strategic digital program is $80 million, on track with our target. 
In addition to these savings, we expect to achieve $260 million to $300 million in run rate savings through Spark as we exit 2024, with benefits growing steadily starting this year, and ramping up in the out years. The total expected onetime investment to achieve the savings is $350 million to $410 million including the $57 million in investments we've made already this year. We expect investment spend to peak in 2022 and decline in subsequent years. 
All numbers that I've just discussed are pretax and pre-DAC. Spark will be focused on driving efficiencies throughout all aspects of our business, from leveraging automation to simplifying and improving process efficiency. And we will continue to focus on enhancing the customer and employee experiences while modernizing our technology footprint. 
We are also targeting benefits beyond cost savings, including improving the way we work by focusing on reskilling and upskilling our valuable employee base. A detailed breakdown of the benefits, investments and net impact for 2021 through 2025 from Spark combined with the remainder of the strategic, the digital initiative can be found in this quarter's press release. We will update you on our progress going forward, tying back to this disclosure. 
To conclude, the pandemic environment continues to challenge our life Insurance and Group Protection segments. However, underlying earnings in these businesses remains strong. Our Annuities and Retirement businesses both delivered excellent results. In sum, our underlying results and earnings power are both strong and growing.

So out of these, what do you think is sort of something that might continue in the near term versus maybe being more of an aberration and just the result of normal volatility and mortality?"

I think, as I said in my script, when it comes to the group business, we think that the results we saw in this quarter reflect the state of the current pandemic, which is that deaths are occurring more frequently in the working age population. If you look at the numbers, it's pretty pronounced this quarter, we use CDC data here, 40% of the 100,000 or so COVID deaths were in the working age population. And in previous quarters, pretty consistently, that had been between 15% and 20%. So you've seen a pretty dramatic shift. I don't know of any reason why that shift should not continue into the fourth quarter. 
So I think what you saw in the group business reflects the state of a pandemic today, even though we do believe that the impact of the pandemic, right, the number of people dying should continue to trend down over time as  immunizations, both natural and the vaccination continue to increase over time. 
On the life side, we think of the impact, which was largely driven by severity this time is more random, pretty consistently over the first 5 quarters or so of the pandemic the average COVID claim we saw is right in the $130,000, $140,000 range. And this quarter was simply an outlier. The average COVID claim this quarter was about $260,000 and there's really no example of that sort of impact in any preceding quarter. So I think of it as more random this quarter in the Life business, really driven by a few large claims that we sell. Hope that helps, Jimmy."

We'd expect that net impact to roughly grow by -- if I use the midpoint, roughly $20 million next year. So a relatively modest incremental negative. 
When you think about the outer years, we ultimately expect the net benefit to grow to the $260 million to $300 million range. So a pretty substantial impact across the organization and something that will be very supportive and why Dennis and us, we're very confident we talk about our ability to grow at or above the top of the end of our 8% to 10% EPS range.

And part of this is investing in ongoing development growth for our employees. So these enhancements across the company, they will improve the customer experience and as Randy has just mentioned, will have a positive impact on our bottom line over time. 
And I want to mention on this, and I mentioned in my remarks that we have a good track record. When we get to the point where we share this information with the investor groups that we pretty much nailed down the framework here and all of the investments that we need there's a name behind it. There's an outcome tied to it, we've put into our financial plans. So we're pretty excited. 
And so you can see it's across the businesses, and some of it, for example, is coming of our IT department, cost reductions inside the IT department, take on new ways of doing business then those cost reductions will flow into all of the businesses. 
In the group area, as Randy had mentioned, where we haven't made as much investment in the digital space and in automation the last couple of years because we're focusing on integration, we'll see some pretty big benefits in that area.

And what you're going to see now is the impact is driven by severity. 
We do see this particular quarter the average COVID claim of $250,000 as an outlier. It's way out of whack with any of the preceding 5 quarters. So we do expect severity to come back down. But once again, you can get some volatility if you get a couple of big claims.
