Good morning, and Happy New year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took. Before I jump into my prepa",2551,"Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and Happy New year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took. Before I jump into my prepared remarks, let me first acknowledge the disheartening and tragic events that unfolded in our nation's capital yesterday. I joined other leaders across the country and condemning the violence that occurred. Instead, calling for a peaceful transfer of power that upholds our democracy and calling for peace, unity and stability as we move forward as a nation. 
Now let's move on to a discussion of our business performance. 2020 was certainly a challenging year. And like many of you, we are happy to turn the page. As we do so, I'm mindful of the words of American Novelist, James Lane Allen, who said, ""adversity does not build character and reveals it."" This is certainly the case for us. Our team rose to meet many challenges that surfaced in 2020. 
This included overcoming many negative impacts from COVID, most notably, a significant volume reduction in the on premise. A slowdown in production of our Mexican beer portfolio heading into our busiest selling season and [ friends ] to the safety, health and well-being of our team members. Despite all that, we continued to build momentum for our high-performing beer brands and launched Corona Hard Seltzer, just as the pandemic started to gain steam in the U.S.. Impressively, this remains one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. We continue to transform our Wine & Spirits business. Leveraging innovation to drive higher growth and margin performance while investing in capabilities needed to win long term, such as DTC and 3-tier eCommerce. And successfully working through the complexities of our transaction with Gallo, which now that it is complete, positions our Wine & Spirits business to become a more meaningful contributor to our overall growth profile. 
And we've also supported our communities by providing much needed assistance to those impacted by COVID and West Coast fires, by taking steps to achieve greater racial equity within our company, our industry and our surrounding communities. By once again earning recognition from the Corporate Equality Index as a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ community. And by improving our carbon disclosure project ratings for climate and water stewardship. 
While 2020 will be remembered for many things. What I will remember most is the character that was revealed by our leaders and team. Preventative measures implemented across our business helped mitigate impacts related to COVID while maintaining full employment resource levels. 
I continue to be impressed by the inspired -- by their resilience, focus and determination for driving the success of our business, and this bodes extremely well for our future. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, our business partners, we delivered excellent third quarter results. 
As Garth and I run through the highlights of the quarter, there are 3 things that I ask you to keep in mind. Number one, our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. Consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust. The introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer has exceeded our expectations, and we're back to gaining share in IRI as we continue to recover from the slowdown in production earlier this year due to COVID. 
Number two, the completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of our lower end wine brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability. Driving focus more fully on a tighter set of powerful brands that already have traction with consumers. And number three, despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. I'm proud to say that our business remains healthy. Allowing us to provide fiscal '21 guidance that I'm sure you will agree, reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. 
This is truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. So let's dig a little deeper with a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down about 35% year-over-year. Constellation's beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth, delivering depletion trends of plus 12% in the quarter. 
And while some depletion growth we saw this quarter included benefits from inventory restocking, the portfolio delivered accelerating underlying trends, that align with our sales growth projection of 7% to 9% for the foreseeable future as consumer demand remains exceptionally strong for our products across the majority of the portfolio. 
In fact, Constellation's beer portfolio posted IRI consumer takeaway dollar growth of more than 15% for the third quarter. As you know, the COVID related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier this year has impacted this year's shipment and volume net sales trends. 
The good news is that we've returned to a position of gaining share in IRI tracked channels as we continue to replenish inventories to more normal levels, which we expect to accomplish by fiscal year-end. A process that's actually taken a little longer than originally planned due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands. 
So let's take a deeper dive into the key brands that drove these excellent trends for our beer business. The Corona brand family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels. Led by particularly strong contributions from Corona Premier, Corona Hard Seltzer and Corona Extra, with the launch of only one, one skewed to date Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations and remains in a strong #4 position in the Hard Seltzer category. It also has the distinction of being the second fastest moving Hard Seltzer among major Seltzer brands while continuing to maintain strong incrementality levels at nearly 90%. 
Early next fiscal year, we plan to launch Corona Hard Seltzer variety pack, #2, which will offer consumers the same great corona taste and refreshment attributes while expanding to new flavors, including pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit. Variety pack #2 will be followed shortly thereafter by the introduction of another exciting new Hard Seltzer initiative. 
We believe these product launches will help further strengthen our competitive position in the fast-growing Hard Seltzer category, broaden our distribution reach and enhance our market share in the high end of the U.S. beer market. These initiatives will be supported with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build upon our Hard Seltzer portfolio. 
2020 marked the 30th consecutive year of Corona's iconic [indiscernible] Palm, commercial, that it was airing on TV during the holiday season. As the longest-running beer commercial of all time, [indiscernible] Palm, demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Corona brand, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which continues to resonate with consumers and remains one of the most beloved consumer brands in the world. 
Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the #1 spot as the top share gaining imported beer in the U.S. beer category with depletion growth of almost 20%. Modelo continues to gain traction with general market consumers while sustaining momentum with its core Hispanic consumer. Driven by the authenticity of the brand and our marketing efforts. 
The success of Modelo has been driven in part by impactful marketing initiatives that include high-profile sports programming with the NFL, NBA, CAA football, Spanish language soccer as well as an ongoing presence on Facebook and Instagram. 
Finally, Pacifico was also a top share gainer within the import segment during the quarter, continuing its strong momentum with depletion growth of nearly 20%. We remain excited about the future growth prospects for this brand as we continue to increase awareness and expand distribution beyond its core market of Southern California. As we've said before, Pacifico has all the makings of the next big brand in our beer portfolio. 
From an operational perspective, we plan to complete the 5 million head-to-leader expansion of our Obregon facility in early fiscal '22, which is a slight delay versus our original plans due to pandemic related construction slowdowns for this project last year. After the completion of Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term, which includes more than doubling our seltzer production capacity heading into the next fiscal year. 
Overall, our excellent year-to-date results provide confidence in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales growth in fiscal '21. In addition, we have increased our operating income growth target to 8% to 10% for the year. 
Now let's move on to the quarterly results for our Wine & Spirits business. As I mentioned earlier, the closure of the Gallo deal and other pending transactions will include a series of actions, which positions our Wine & Spirits business for accelerated revenue growth and operating margin performance going forward. We are grateful for the dedication of our constellation team and the support and collaboration from Gallo and our business partners as we ensure a smooth transition. 
With the completion of the divestitures, we believe the Wine & Spirits business is positioned to grow net sales low to mid-single digits while producing operating income growth ahead of net sales growth as the business works to take out stranded costs and execute against other cost, price/mix and efficiency improvements to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. In the near term, we expect the remaining portfolio post the Gallo deal to generate fiscal '21 net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. 
With these transactions now behind us, our team can more fully concentrate resources and focus behind a smaller set of more premium brands to better align with consumer-led premiumization trends. During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of these trends as premiumization continues to drive elevated growth across the total beverage alcohol segment. Further reinforcing the transformation strategy for our business. 
Our higher-end wine power brands at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high end wine category IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company portfolio. All of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. 
Overall, we expect these brands to be key growth drivers of the business long term. And we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth, higher-margin brands. During the quarter, successful new innovation initiatives also contributed to top line growth, with power brand introductions like The Prisoner cabernetsauvignon and chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi, cabernet sauvignon, which has become this year's biggest ultra-premium wine introduction in IRI channels based on dollar sales. 
In addition, several other innovation initiatives launched earlier this year continued to gain traction and drive growth, including brands like unshackled from the Prisoner Wine portfolio. Kim Crawford Illuminate and Woodbridge Spirits barrel age Veritas, just to name a few. And let's not forget Woodbridge wine copecs, which became the #2 innovation this year in IRI channels based on dollar sales. 
We are also successfully driving our digital commerce initiatives, which are gaining momentum. Since our acquisition of Empathy wines, we have continued to make significant progress and leveraging their unique platform and capabilities across our portfolio within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce space. We have launched several new DTC sites leveraging the empathy platform, including The Prisoner Wine Company, Double Diamond and Semi. We believe this category will be a meaningful pillar of growth for constellation in the future. 
In fact, our wine power brands competing in the e-commerce space are outpacing the overall wine category as our early investment in the category is providing us with a meaningful first-mover advantage. During the quarter, we became the first CPG company to partner with Instacart to feature our products on Facebook ads propelling constellation to the next level of 3-tier eCommerce media by enabling us to refine and optimize our ad creative and targeting based on real-time data. Furthermore, it is important to our growth and margin profile that we continue to invest in this space since DTC is heavily weighted toward the higher end of the wine category, as wines price $20 and up, make up nearly 90% of total DTC sales. 
Now moving on to a discussion of our investment in Canopy Growth. We're pleased with the progress the Canopy Growth team has made in defining and strategically positioning themselves in the U.S. CBD and legal THC cannabis markets. Which will be beneficial upon U.S. federal permissibility, which was probably enhanced with the change in the Senate that's occurred in the last 48 hours. 
Canopy's core Biosteel beverages are now the official sports strength of the Dallas Mavericks,  The Philadelphia 76ers and The Toronto Raptors. And has several standout athlete and influencer partners, including the raining NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes. 
In fact, Canopy predicts that CBD beverages can grow at a 35% CAGR through 2025 as consumer realized the compelling benefits from CBD beverages. In addition, Biosteel now has 2 exclusive partnerships with Manhattan Beer and the Rayos Beer division, 2 key constellation distributors, which will give canopy the ability to gain traction in the U.S. market well ahead of its competitors in the emerging CBD space. 
In September, Canopy launched  Martha Stewart  branded CBD product line which is available on shopcanopy.com and several other outlets, including its new national distribution agreement with the vitamin shop, retail locations, just-in-time for the holidays. 
Canopy will continue to seek strategic partnerships like the one with Martha Stewart to drive consumer awareness for these products. Overall, we believe that Canopy will be a significant long-term growth opportunity for constellation, and we believe they remain best positioned to win long-term in the emerging cannabis space. 
In closing, I want to take you back to the key takeaways mentioned earlier. I'm extremely proud of the results of our team and what they have driven in the face of continued adversity. Our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. The completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of lower end brands priced at $11 and below retail, has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability. 
Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. Our excellent third quarter performance drove strong cash generation, which coupled with the finalization of the Gallo deal, enhances the financial profile of our business enables further debt reduction and allows us to continue to execute our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal '23. 
Our business remains extremely healthy. And these strong results are truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Garth?"

Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Sp",2666,"Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. 
Specifically, during our third quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth of $3.16. An increase of 32% versus prior year, delivered strong operating margin and accelerating double-digit depletion growth for our beer business and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 14% and 23%, respectively, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and achievement of targeted net leverage, excluding Canopy Equity earnings, as we ended the quarter at 3.3x. 
As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have closed the transaction to sell a portion of our Wine & Spirits business to Gallo, including the Nobilo wine brand. As well as closing the transaction to sell our concentrate business to [ Vidal ]. 
As an update, we expect to close the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy transaction within the next several weeks. Post-transaction closing, we are left with a more focused and premium portfolio, which nicely positions our Wine & Spirits business to produce low to mid-single-digit top line growth, while migrating to an operating margin of 30% in the medium term. 
In total, at transaction close, Constellation received cash of approximately $560 million and the opportunity to receive up to $250 million in earn-outs if brand performance targets are met over a 2- year period after closing. We also received approximately $130 million related to the closing of the Nobilo deal and expect to receive approximately $265 million from Sazerac upon closing the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy deal. 
In total, from all transactions, we expect to receive approximately $955 million before tax, and we expect the overall tax payments related to the transactions to be approximately $50 million, which are expected to be paid in fiscal '22. The cash proceeds from these transactions will facilitate further debt reduction, so we can continue to execute on our commitment to lower our leverage ratio and to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023. 
The cash proceeds received from Gallo reflect a significant inventory adjustment. Due to the prolonged timing of the Gallo deal, we were able to sell-through a significant amount of finished goods inventory that was originally slated to go to Gallo. Also, as indicated last quarter, we have flexibility in how we source grapes to mitigate any shortages due to the wildfires. 
As a result, we decided to retain a portion of bulk wine inventory as we had a higher and better use for it as a replacement for smoke tainted bulk resulting from the wildfires. Those 2 factors resulted in substantial cash flow for constellation throughout the fiscal year. 
Before we jump into the quarterly financial results, I'd like to provide an update on guidance. Due to the continued resiliency of our business and further clarity of the operating environment. We have issued fiscal 2021 EPS guidance and are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to range between $9.8 and $10.05. This range excludes future Canopy equity and earnings impact and accounts for the respective timing of the previous mentioned deal closures. 
Now let's review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 28% on shipment volume growth of 27%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 30% and driven by organic shipment volume growth of 28% and favorable price and mix. Depletion volume for the quarter accelerated and achieved 12% growth as inventory levels improved and strong performance continued in the off-premise channel, which more than offset the impact of approximately 35% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. 
Depletions in the quarter benefited by approximately 3 to 4 points driven by inventory restocking. While underlying consumer demand for our products remain strong, the robust shipment and depletion volume growth experienced during the quarter was enhanced by inventory replenishment at both the distributor and retailer level. As product inventories begin to rebuild from a COVID related slowdown of Mexican beer production earlier in the fiscal year. This resulted in Q3 year-to-date organic shipment and depletion volume growth of approximately 6% to 7%, which is in line with our medium-term goals and accounts for volume timing between quarters. 
Due to continued robust consumer demand, product inventories are now expected to return to historically normal levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and as shipment volume is expected to continue to outpace depletion volume for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 330 basis points versus prior year to 42.6%. Benefits from marketing and SGA as a percent of net sales, foreign exchange and the ballast point divestiture more than offset unfavorable operational and logistics costs. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by higher material costs, brewery compensation and benefits and depreciation, while the increased logistics costs resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments from our breweries in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. 
These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing dollars spent during the quarter increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable leverage driven by increased throughput at our breweries, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 9.3%. We now expect full year fiscal '21 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 9.5% range. 
Now let's discuss balance of year expectations and full year fiscal '21 beer guidance. We expect net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio. Excluding the impact of Ballast Point, we expect organic net sales to land in the higher end of the 7% to 9% range. We now expect fiscal '21 operating income growth of 8% to 10%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance provided during the quarter. 
Furthermore, we expect full year operating margin to range between 40% and 41%, achieving margin expansion versus prior year operating margin of 40%. Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a margin perspective as the beer segment will experience some headwinds during the quarter. First, as a reminder, we took selective price increases this fall as we decided to stagger our annual price increases. And in some instances, these increases will shift in the beginning of our fiscal '22. As a result, we saw favorable price -- we saw pricing favorability muted in Q3, which will continue in Q4. 
Second, from a COGS perspective, we will continue to incur incremental shipping costs due to actions we're taking to accelerate the replenishment of inventory across the network. We also expect margin headwinds related to incremental headcount driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which is now expected to be completed in early fiscal '22. 
Lastly, we expect increased marketing spend to be the largest headwind to margins in the fourth quarter, driven by the shift in spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year. Our Q4 investment will focus on incremental media in both the NFL and NBA, incremental digital media and continued support behind Corona Hard Seltzer, which includes a holiday spot, leveraging the equity of the iconic Corona Extra [ Otan ] and Palm ad. These incremental investments made during the holiday season and into the beginning of the calendar year, will provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season. 
Moving to Wine & Spirits. Q3 power brand depletion volume accelerated and achieved nearly 4% growth as these brands continue to win in the higher end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. Wine category. Overall depletion volume declined 1%, which reflect the brands recently divested. Wine & Spirits net sales increased 10% on shipment volume up 3%, driven by our power brands as well as strong innovation contributions. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Q3 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands recently divested, driven by the timing of the Gallo deal. Operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 24% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS and increased marketing, driven by the shift in spend from the first half. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million, resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the wildfires. This came in slightly favorable versus what we originally anticipated and guided for the quarter. However, we still expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs in Q4 associated with unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the wildfires. During the quarter, we also recognized a $26.5 million loss in connection with the write-down of certain grades as a result of smoke damage sustained during the wildfires. However, these costs were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses from grapes, from our own vineyards, and we're actively pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers. As we continue to work through our processes, additional write-downs of certain bulk wine inventory may be needed for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, which would be excluded from comparable basis results as well. 
As a reminder, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products. Even though margins for the segment took a step back during Q3, the underlying fundamentals of our consumer-led premiumization strategy continued to shine through as significant mix and price were generated during the quarter. Strong shipment volume mix was driven by some of our fastest moving power brands such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi, the Prisoner brand family, and we're continuing to see benefits from the pricing actions we took on both  Woodbridge and SVEDKA at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Moving along to the balance of the year expectations and full year fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits guidance. We now expect fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 9% to 11%, and 16% to 18%, respectively, which reflects the closing of the Gallo transaction, including Nobilo and the concentrate transaction as well as the Paul Masson divestiture. 
In addition, we expect the retained portfolio post divestitures to grow net sales in the 2% to 4% range this year. Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a Wine & Spirits segment perspective. For Q4, we expect power brand depletion volumes to be muted due to the following: first, we are lapping strong Q4 fiscal '20  Woodbridge volume buying ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1. Second, we are also lapping solid Q4 fiscal '20 innovation driven by the rollout of unshackled. And finally, we are continuing our efforts to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states to allow for better inventory management going forward. 
Also, let me provide an update on marketing cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. In the first half of the fiscal year, reduced marketing spend provided margin benefits due to timing as we shifted spend from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year. Originally, we expected a majority of the shift to impact Q3. However, we now expect the shift in spend to be more equally distributed between Q3 and Q4. We are also expecting incremental investment in Q4, creating strong support for our power brands as we propel our momentum into fiscal '22.  This will result in an increase in year-over-year spend for Q4. 
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $171 million, up 15% versus Q3 year-to-date last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. 
We now expect full year corporate expense to approximate $240 million. This is a good spot to provide an update on our  SAP S/4HANA implementation. I'm excited to announce that the final phase of our SAP implementation is scheduled to go live on March 1, 2021. We have various business continuity processes and resources in place to ensure this transition goes as smoothly as possible and look forward to updating everybody on our efforts during our Q4 call. 
As a reminder, we expect corporate expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease by the end of fiscal '22 once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented, and we begin to eliminate redundant IT costs allowing us to realize benefits of the new platform. 
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 7% to approximately $96 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Fiscal '21 interest expense is now expected to approximate $390 million. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 17.7% versus 17.5% in Q3 last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. As indicated last quarter, we expect our full year fiscal '21 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings impact to approximate 19%. The which would imply an increase in the Q4 tax rate driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits. 
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the first 9 months of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 23% increase and reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We are projecting full year fiscal '21 CapEx spend to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes $650 million to $750 million of beer CapEx as we expect an acceleration of spend during Q4, driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon. 
Furthermore, we expect fiscal '21 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Moving to Canopy. In Q3, we recognized a $770 million increase in fair value of our Canopy investments. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $834 million, which increased significantly from Q2, driven by Canopy's robust share price movement during the quarter. 
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we've navigated through a challenging and volatile economic environment throughout the first 9 months of our fiscal year, we believed it was financially prudent to focus on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. As a result of our strong cash generation profile, we've reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion since the end of fiscal '20, which has led to further reduction of our leverage ratio to our target range. These financial strides, coupled with the fact that our business has continued to remain resilient through this economic environment now provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic and resume share repurchase activity in the near-term as we remain fully committed to our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23. 
We are also pleased that the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

And then also, maybe can you just touch on if there's any risk, specifically in fiscal Q4 with the rising COVID case counts and weaker on-premise trends before we cycle the COVID impact from last year in March."

Yes, one of the benefits that we've seen as our business has been moving through the year is that we are getting back to our long-term trends that we have previously announced. And that's driven, quite frankly, by the strength of our brands. Modelo in this quarter was nearly 20% depletion growth, Pacifico was the same. These brands are resonating with consumers. And keep in mind, that's all being done, which relates to your second question, with on-premise trends that are really not very good. Year-to-date on-premise for our beer business is off 53%. So I think the fact that we have produced these kinds of results with that environment speaks to the strength of our beer portfolio and the long-term positioning that we have for those brands.  You then throw in the fact that we are more than doubling our capability in seltzer next year. And I think we should expect to see consistent with our long-term trends, the growth profile that we've previously stated."

Although you revised it higher, it actually still implies a pretty big hit to your beer margins in Q4. So I just really wanted to better understand why this is the case, especially as I look at the easy year-over-year margin comp, even factoring in the year-over-year increase you just called out in terms of marketing spend.

So we feel really good about that margin profile, by the way. But you're right, that does imply some bit of dilution, if you will, in Q4. 
So let me just give you some of the elements that make up that.  As we said, the biggest driver of that is going to be marketing because we think it's important that we continue to spend behind the brands and support the brands, particularly Corona Hard Seltzer. And so there's going to be a significant increase in marketing spend in Q4. Additionally, we have a couple of COGS related headwinds in Q4. One is, as we've had even in Q3, which is freight and logistics as we're doing things to expedite shipments into the U.S. to ensure that we're increasing our inventory levels to more historical levels. And then furthermore, under COGS, we also have increased headcount in Obregon as we get ready to turn on the next 5 million hectoliters of capacity at Obregon. 
And we also in Q4, have some brewery maintenance that we shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And then finally, the last thing is just as we talked about, the staggered pricing increases that we've taken this year, and which we staggered them through Q3 and Q4 and some will flow into the first quarter of next year. So all of those together, is what's leading to a bit of a giveback on margins in Q4."

And certainly, with the more than doubling of capacity next year, we expect to remain a very strong player and a top 3 player in that particular segment. Keeping in mind, Nik, we have the second best velocity in the category with that particular brand with 1 skew. So I think as we're able to broaden our distribution reach on the shelf, I think we'll be very pleased with where seltzer is when we're sitting here a year from now. As it relates to Light, obviously, a lot of our work, a lot of our time and energy has been spent on Premier, which we're very excited about, continues to be a big growth profile for us. So I think we need to think about that particular -- the Light business in conjunction with what we are doing across the overall Light category, Premier, Corona Light, et cetera.

And relative to distribution trends, we were actually quite pleased with our ability to hold shelf presence. As you know, and we said in prior calls, we focused our attention on the 20-ish SKUs that represented more than 75% of our total portfolio during the time when we had a slowdown in production. So that allowed us to expand and extend some of those SKUs on shelf and allowed us to maintain our position. 
Obviously, now that we have been able to raise our production rates, and we are filling in some of those scenarios that had occurred. We're quite pleased that we're maintaining and, in fact, growing our distribution platform going forward.

Good morning, and Happy New Year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took.
Before I jump into my prepared remarks, let me first acknowledge the disheartening and tragic events that unfolded in our nation's Capitol yesterday. I join other leaders across the country in condemning the violence that occurred. Instead, calling for a peaceful transfer of power that upholds our democracy and calling for peace, unity and stability as we move forward as a nation.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our business performance. 2020 was certainly a challenging year. And like many of you, we are happy to turn the page. As we do so, I'm mindful of the words of American novelist James Lane Allen who said, ""Adversity does not build character, it reveals it."" This is certainly the case for us. Our team rose to meet many challenges that surfaced in 2020. This included overcoming many negative impacts from COVID, most notably, a significant volume reduction in the on-premise, a slowdown in production of our Mexican beer portfolio heading into our busiest selling season and threats to the safety, health and well-being of our team members.
Despite all that, we continued to build momentum for our high-performing beer brands and launched Corona Hard Seltzer just as the pandemic started to gain steam in the U.S. Impressively, this remains one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. We continue to transform our Wine & Spirits business, leveraging innovation to drive higher growth and margin performance while investing in capabilities needed to win long term, such as DTC and 3-tier eCommerce. And successfully working through the complexities of our transaction with Gallo, which, now that it is complete, positions our Wine & Spirits business to become a more meaningful contributor to our overall growth profile.
And we've also supported our communities by providing much needed assistance to those impacted by COVID and West Coast fires, by taking steps to achieve greater racial equity within our company, our industry and our surrounding communities, by once again earning recognition from the Corporate Equality Index as a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ community and by improving our carbon disclosure project ratings for climate and water stewardship.
While 2020 will be remembered for many things, what I will remember most is the character that was revealed by our leaders and team. Preventative measures implemented across our business helped mitigate impacts related to COVID while maintaining full employment resource levels. I continue to be inspired by their resilience, focus and determination for driving the success of our business, and this bodes extremely well for our future. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, our business partners, we delivered excellent third quarter results.
As Garth and I run through the highlights of the quarter, there are 3 things that I ask you to keep in mind. Number one, our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth, remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. Consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust. The introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer has exceeded our expectations, and we're back to gaining share in IRI as we continue to recover from the slowdown in production earlier this year due to COVID. Number two, the completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of our lower end wine brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability, driving focus more fully on a tighter set of powerful brands that already have traction with consumers. And number three, despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals.
I'm proud to say that our business remains healthy, allowing us to provide fiscal '21 guidance that, I'm sure you will agree, reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This is truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. So let's dig a little deeper with a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter.
Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down about 35% year-over-year, Constellation's beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth, delivering depletion trends of plus 12% in the quarter. And while some depletion growth we saw this quarter included benefits from inventory restocking, the portfolio delivered accelerating underlying trends that align with our sales growth projection of 7% to 9% for the foreseeable future as consumer demand remains exceptionally strong for our products across the majority of the portfolio. In fact, Constellation's beer portfolio posted IRI consumer takeaway dollar growth of more than 15% for the third quarter.
As you know, the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier this year has impacted this year's shipment and volume net sales trends. The good news is that we've returned to a position of gaining share in IRI tracked channels as we continue to replenish inventories to more normal levels, which we expect to accomplish by fiscal year-end, a process that's actually taken a little longer than originally planned due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands.
So let's take a deeper dive into the key brands that drove these excellent trends for our beer business. The Corona brand family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels led by particularly strong contributions from Corona Premier, Corona Hard Seltzer and Corona Extra. With the launch of only one, one SKU to date, Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations and remains in a strong #4 position in the hard seltzer category. It also has the distinction of being the second fastest moving hard seltzer among major seltzer brands while continuing to maintain strong incrementality levels at nearly 90%.
Early next fiscal year, we plan to launch Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which will offer consumers the same great Corona taste and refreshment attributes while expanding to new flavors, including pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit. Variety Pack #2 will be followed shortly thereafter by the introduction of another exciting new hard seltzer initiative. We believe these product launches will help further strengthen our competitive position in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, broaden our distribution reach and enhance our market share in the high end of the U.S. beer market. These initiatives will be supported with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build upon our hard seltzer portfolio.
2020 marked the 30th consecutive year of Corona's iconic O' Tannenpalm commercial that it was airing on TV during the holiday season. As the longest-running beer commercial of all time, O' Tannenpalm demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Corona brand, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which continues to resonate with consumers and remains one of the most beloved consumer brands in the world.
Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the #1 spot as the top share gaining imported beer in the U.S. beer category with depletion growth of almost 20%. Modelo continues to gain traction with general market consumers while sustaining momentum with its core Hispanic consumer, driven by the authenticity of the brand and our marketing efforts. The success of Modelo has been driven in part by impactful marketing initiatives that include high-profile sports programming with the NFL, NBA, NCAA Football, Spanish language soccer as well as an ongoing presence on Facebook and Instagram.
Finally, Pacifico was also a top share gainer within the import segment during the quarter, continuing its strong momentum with depletion growth of nearly 20%. We remain excited about the future growth prospects for this brand as we continue to increase awareness and expand distribution beyond its core market of Southern California. As we've said before, Pacifico has all the makings of the next big brand in our beer portfolio.
From an operational perspective, we plan to complete the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility in early fiscal '22, which is a slight delay versus our original plans due to pandemic-related construction slowdowns for this project last year. After the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term, which includes more than doubling our seltzer production capacity heading into the next fiscal year.
Overall, our excellent year-to-date results provide confidence in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales growth in fiscal '21. In addition, we have increased our operating income growth target to 8% to 10% for the year. Now let's move on to the quarterly results for our Wine & Spirits business.
As I mentioned earlier, the closure of the Gallo deal and other pending transactions will include a series of actions which positions our Wine & Spirits business for accelerated revenue growth and operating margin performance going forward. We are grateful for the dedication of our Constellation team and the support and collaboration from Gallo and our business partners as we ensure a smooth transition.
With the completion of the divestitures, we believe the Wine & Spirits business is positioned to grow net sales low to mid-single digits while producing operating income growth ahead of net sales growth as the business works to take out stranded costs and execute against other cost, price/mix and efficiency improvements to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. In the near term, we expect the remaining portfolio post the Gallo deal to generate fiscal '21 net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range.
With these transactions now behind us, our team can more fully concentrate resources and focus behind a smaller set of more premium brands to better align with consumer-led premiumization trends. During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of these trends as premiumization continues to drive elevated growth across the total beverage alcohol segment, further reinforcing the transformation strategy for our business.
Our higher-end wine power brands at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high end wine category IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. Overall, we expect these brands to be key growth drivers of the business long term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth, higher-margin brands. During the quarter, successful new innovation initiatives also contributed to top line growth, with power brand introductions like The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, which has become this year's biggest ultra-premium wine introduction in IRI channels based on dollar sales.
In addition, several other innovation initiatives launched earlier this year continued to gain traction and drive growth, including brands like Unshackled from The Prisoner Wine portfolio, Kim Crawford Illuminate and Woodbridge spirits barrel-aged varietals just to name a few. And let's not forget Woodbridge wine go packs, which became the #2 innovation this year in IRI channels based on dollar sales.
We are also successfully driving our digital commerce initiatives which are gaining momentum. Since our acquisition of Empathy Wines, we have continued to make significant progress in leveraging their unique platform and capabilities across our portfolio within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce space. We have launched several new DTC sites leveraging the Empathy platform, including The Prisoner Wine Company, Double Diamond and SIMI. We believe this category will be a meaningful pillar of growth for Constellation in the future.
In fact, our wine power brands competing in the eCommerce space are outpacing the overall wine category as our early investment in the category is providing us with a meaningful first-mover advantage. During the quarter, we became the first CPG company to partner with Instacart to feature our products on Facebook ads, propelling Constellation to the next level of 3-tier eCommerce media by enabling us to refine and optimize our ad creative and targeting based on real-time data. Furthermore, it is important to our growth and margin profile that we continue to invest in this space since DTC is heavily weighted toward the higher end of the wine category, as wines priced $20 and up make up nearly 90% of total DTC sales.
Now moving on to a discussion of our investment in Canopy Growth. We're pleased with the progress the Canopy Growth team has made in defining and strategically positioning themselves in the U.S. CBD and legal THC cannabis markets, which will be beneficial upon U.S. federal permissibility, which was probably enhanced with the change in the Senate that's occurred in the last 48 hours.
Canopy's core BioSteel beverages are now the official sports drink of the Dallas Mavericks, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors and has several standout athlete and influencer partners, including the reigning NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes. In fact, Canopy predicts that CBD beverages can grow at a 35% CAGR through 2025 as consumer realize the compelling benefits from CBD beverages. In addition, BioSteel now has 2 exclusive partnerships with Manhattan Beer and the Reyes Beer Division, 2 key Constellation distributors, which will give Canopy the ability to gain traction in the U.S. market well ahead of its competitors in the emerging CBD space.
In September, Canopy launched a Martha Stewart branded CBD product line which is available on shopcanopy.com and several other outlets, including its new national distribution agreement with The Vitamin Shoppe retail locations, just in time for the holidays. Canopy will continue to seek strategic partnerships like the one with Martha Stewart to drive consumer awareness for these products. Overall, we believe that Canopy will be a significant long-term growth opportunity for Constellation, and we believe they remain best positioned to win long term in the emerging cannabis space.
In closing, I want to take you back to the key takeaways mentioned earlier. I'm extremely proud of the results of our team and what they have driven in the face of continued adversity. Our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth, remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. The completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of lower end brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability.
Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. Our excellent third quarter performance drove strong cash generation, which, coupled with the finalization of the Gallo deal, enhances the financial profile of our business, enables further debt reduction and allows us to continue to execute our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal '23. Our business remains extremely healthy, and these strong results are truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Garth?"
258589,696944452,2166508,"Constellation Brands, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2021",2021-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone.Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Spe",2652,"Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone.
Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Specifically, during our third quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth, of $3.16, an increase of 32% versus prior year, delivered strong operating margin and accelerating double-digit depletion growth for our beer business and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 14% and 23%, respectively, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and achievement of targeted net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings, as we ended the quarter at 3.3x.
As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have closed the transaction to sell a portion of our Wine & Spirits business to Gallo, including the Nobilo Wine brand, as well as closing the transaction to sell our concentrate business to Vie-Del. As an update, we expect to close the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy transaction within the next several weeks. Post transaction closing, we are left with a more focused and premium portfolio, which nicely positions our Wine & Spirits business to produce low to mid-single-digit top line growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30% in the medium term.
In total, at transaction close, Constellation received cash of approximately $560 million and the opportunity to receive up to $250 million in earn-outs if brand performance targets are met over a 2-year period after closing. We also received approximately $130 million related to the closing of the Nobilo deal and expect to receive approximately $265 million from Sazerac upon closing the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy deal.
In total, from all transactions, we expect to receive approximately $955 million before tax, and we expect the overall tax payments related to the transactions to be approximately $50 million, which are expected to be paid in fiscal '22. The cash proceeds from these transactions will facilitate further debt reduction so we can continue to execute on our commitment to lower our leverage ratio and to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023.
The cash proceeds received from Gallo reflect a significant inventory adjustment. Due to the prolonged timing of the Gallo deal, we were able to sell through a significant amount of finished goods inventory that was originally slated to go to Gallo. Also, as indicated last quarter, we have flexibility in how we source grapes to mitigate any shortages due to the wildfires. As a result, we decided to retain a portion of bulk wine inventory as we had a higher and better use for it as a replacement for smoke-tainted bulk resulting from the wildfires. Those 2 factors resulted in substantial cash flow for Constellation throughout the fiscal year.
Before we jump into the quarterly financial results, I'd like to provide an update on guidance. Due to the continued resiliency of our business and further clarity of the operating environment, we have issued fiscal 2021 EPS guidance and are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to range between $9.80 and $10.05. This range excludes future Canopy equity in earnings impact and accounts for the respective timing of the previous mentioned deal closures.
Now let's review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Net sales increased 28% on shipment volume growth of 27%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 30% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 28% and favorable price and mix.
Depletion volume for the quarter accelerated and achieved 12% growth as inventory levels improved and strong performance continued in the off-premise channel, which more than offset the impact of approximately 35% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. Depletions in the quarter benefited by approximately 3 to 4 points driven by inventory restocking.
While underlying consumer demand for our products remain strong, the robust shipment and depletion volume growth experienced during the quarter was enhanced by inventory replenishment at both the distributor and retailer level as product inventories begin to rebuild from a COVID-related slowdown of Mexican beer production earlier in the fiscal year. This resulted in Q3 year-to-date organic shipment and depletion volume growth of approximately 6% to 7%, which is in line with our medium-term goals and accounts for volume timing between quarters. Due to continued robust consumer demand, product inventories are now expected to return to historically normal levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as shipment volume is expected to continue to outpace depletion volume for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 330 basis points versus prior year to 42.6%. Benefits from marketing and SGA as a percent of net sales, foreign exchange and the Ballast Point divestiture more than offset unfavorable operational and logistics costs. The increase in operational cost was driven primarily by higher material costs, brewery compensation and benefits and depreciation, while the increased logistics cost resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments from our breweries in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption.
On an absolute dollar basis, marketing dollars spent during the quarter increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable leverage driven by increased throughput at our breweries, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 9.3%. We now expect full year fiscal '21 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 9.5% range.
Now let's discuss balance of year expectations and full year fiscal '21 beer guidance. We expect net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio. Excluding the impact of Ballast Point, we expect organic net sales to land in the higher end of the 7% to 9% range. We now expect fiscal '21 operating income growth of 8% to 10%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance provided during the quarter. Furthermore, we expect full year operating margin to range between 40% and 41%, achieving margin expansion versus prior year operating margin of 40%.
Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a margin perspective as the beer segment will experience some headwinds during the quarter. First, as a reminder, we took selective price increases this fall as we decided to stagger our annual price increases. And in some instances, these increases will shift in the beginning of our fiscal '22. As a result, we saw pricing favorability muted in Q3 which will continue in Q4.
Second, from a COGS perspective, we will continue to incur incremental shipping costs due to actions we're taking to accelerate the replenishment of inventory across the network. We also expect margin headwinds related to incremental headcount driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which is now expected to be completed in early fiscal '22.
Lastly, we expect increased marketing spend to be the largest headwind to margins in the fourth quarter, driven by the shift in spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year. Our Q4 investment will focus on incremental media in both the NFL and NBA, incremental digital media and continued support behind Corona Hard Seltzer, which includes a holiday spot, leveraging the equity of the iconic Corona Extra O' Tannenpalm ad. These incremental investments made during the holiday season and into the beginning of the calendar year will provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season.
Moving to Wine & Spirits. Q3 power brand depletion volume accelerated and achieved nearly 4% growth as these brands continue to win in the higher end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. wine category. Overall depletion volume declined 1%, which reflect the brands recently divested.
Wine & Spirits net sales increased 10% on shipment volume up 3%, driven by our power brands as well as strong innovation contributions. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Q3 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands recently divested driven by the timing of the Gallo deal.
Operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 24% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS and increased marketing driven by the shift in spend from the first half. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million, resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the wildfires. This came in slightly favorable versus what we originally anticipated and guided for the quarter. However, we still expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs in Q4 associated with unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the wildfires.
During the quarter, we also recognized a $26.5 million loss in connection with the write-down of certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the wildfires. However, these costs were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses from grapes from our own vineyards, and we're actively pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers. As we continue to work through our processes, additional write-downs of certain bulk wine inventory may be needed for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, which would be excluded from comparable basis results as well. As a reminder, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products.
Even though margins for the segment took a step back during Q3, the underlying fundamentals of our consumer-led premiumization strategy continue to shine through as significant mix and price were generated during the quarter. Strong shipment volume mix was driven by some of our fastest moving power brands such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner brand family, and we're continuing to see benefits from the pricing actions we took on both Woodbridge and SVEDKA at the beginning of the fiscal year.
Moving along to balance of the year expectations and full year fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits guidance. We now expect fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 9% to 11% and 16% to 18%, respectively, which reflects the closing of the Gallo transaction, including Nobilo and the concentrate transaction as well as the Paul Masson divestiture. In addition, we expect the retained portfolio post divestitures to grow net sales in the 2% to 4% range this year.
Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a Wine & Spirits segment perspective. For Q4, we expect power brand depletion volumes to be muted due to the following: first, we are lapping strong Q4 fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1. Second, we are also lapping solid Q4 fiscal '20 innovation driven by the rollout of Unshackled. And finally, we are continuing our efforts to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states to allow for better inventory management going forward.
Also, let me provide an update on marketing cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. In the first half of the fiscal year, reduced marketing spend provided margin benefits due to timing as we shifted spend from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year. Originally, we expected a majority of the shift to impact Q3. However, we now expect the shift in spend to be more equally distributed between Q3 and Q4. We are also expecting incremental investment in Q4, creating strong support for our power brands as we propel our momentum into fiscal '22. This will result in an increase in year-over-year spend for Q4.
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $171 million, up 15% versus Q3 year-to-date last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. We now expect full year corporate expense to approximate $240 million.
This is a good spot to provide an update on our SAP S/4HANA implementation. I'm excited to announce that the final phase of our SAP implementation is scheduled to go live on March 1, 2021. We have various business continuity processes and resources in place to ensure this transition goes as smoothly as possible and look forward to updating everybody on our efforts during our Q4 call. As a reminder, we expect corporate expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease by the end of fiscal '22 once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented and we begin to eliminate redundant IT costs, allowing us to realize benefits of the new platform.
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 7% to approximately $96 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Fiscal '21 interest expense is now expected to approximate $390 million.
Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 17.7% versus 17.5% in Q3 last year primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. As indicated last quarter, we expect our full year fiscal '21 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity in earnings impact, to approximate 19%, which would imply an increase in the Q4 tax rate driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits.
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the first 9 months of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 23% increase and reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We are projecting full year fiscal '21 CapEx spend to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes $650 million to $750 million of beer CapEx as we expect an acceleration of spend during Q4, driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon. Furthermore, we expect fiscal '21 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion.
Moving to Canopy. In Q3, we recognized a $770 million increase in fair value of our Canopy investment. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $834 million, which increased significantly from Q2 driven by Canopy's robust share price movement during the quarter.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we've navigated through a challenging and volatile economic environment throughout the first 9 months of our fiscal year, we believed it was financially prudent to focus on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. As a result of our strong cash generation profile, we've reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion since the end of fiscal '20, which has led to further reduction of our leverage ratio to our target range. These financial strides, coupled with the fact that our business has continued to remain resilient through this economic environment, now provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic and resume share repurchase activity in the near term as we remain fully committed to our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23. We are also pleased that the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases.
And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

And keep in mind, that's all being done, which relates to your second question, with on-premise trends that are really not very good. Year-to-date, on-premise for our beer business is off 53%.
So I think the fact that we have produced these kinds of results with that environment speaks to the strength of our beer portfolio and the long-term positioning that we have for those brands. You then throw in the fact that we are more than doubling our capability in seltzer next year, and I think we should expect to see, consistent with our long-term trends, the growth profile that we've previously stated."

So we feel really good about that margin profile, by the way. But you're right, that does imply some bit of dilution, if you will, in Q4. So let me just give you some of the elements that make up that.
As we said, the biggest driver of that is going to be marketing because we think it's important that we continue to spend behind the brands and support the brands, particularly Corona Hard Seltzer. And so there's going to be a significant increase in marketing spend in Q4. Additionally, we have a couple of COGS-related headwinds in Q4. One is, as we've had even in Q3, which is freight and logistics as we're doing things to expedite shipments into the U.S. to ensure that we're increasing our inventory levels to more historical levels. And then furthermore, under COGS, we also have increased headcount in Obregon as we get ready to turn on the next 5 million hectoliters of capacity at Obregon. And we also in Q4 have some brewery maintenance that we shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And then finally, the last thing is just as we talked about, the staggered pricing increases that we've taken this year, which we staggered them through Q3 and Q4 and some will flow into the first quarter of next year. So all of those together is what's leading to a bit of a giveback on margins in Q4."

And certainly, with the more than doubling of capacity next year, we expect to remain a very strong player and a top 3 player in that particular segment. Keeping in mind, Nik, we have the second best velocity in the category with that particular brand with one SKU. So I think as we're able to broaden our distribution reach on the shelf, I think we'll be very pleased with where seltzer is when we're sitting here a year from now.
As it relates to Light, obviously, a lot of our work, a lot of our time and energy has been spent on Premier, which we're very excited about, continues to be a big growth profile for us. So I think we need to think about the Light business in conjunction with what we are doing across the overall light category, Premier, Corona Light, et cetera.

And I don't think we have seen, I would slightly disagree with your comment that there's been a more aggressive environment or an aggressive promotional environment. Fortunately, the robust demand that we've seen in many of our power brands above $11, where we had lots of double-digit growers, our demand has been very strong, and that has been the single biggest driver of our improved wine results is the sheer demand for our products. And the fact that the consumer is looking for our brands and products that they have great faith in, especially as their shopping patterns have changed some."

It starts and it always will start with the strength of the brands. And certainly, as we were able to get our inventory position into a much better place during the quarter, it was reflected in our results, and it was reflected in the demand consumers had. Remember, we had roughly 15% growth across the beer portfolio in IRI during the quarter, extremely robust growth, especially given the fact that on-premise was a drag to say the least. Fortunately, again, we are a little less susceptible to the on-premise than some of the overall marketplace, but the sheer strength of our brands was a critical factor.
No question, some of the depletion pieces Garth noted in his remarks were driven by our replacing some of the inventory that had decreased during the time when we were not able to produce. But I think we do need to keep in mind, at the end of the day, it's all about consumer takeout, and consumers are strongly demanding our critical brands."

So we expect it to certainly be a competitive marketplace, but demand remains strong. And that's certainly to our advantage because our brands have performed very well in that mix. As we've said, we are going to continue to invest behind our brand. Our brands respond extremely well. Jim Sabia does an outstanding job with his team about making sure that we get tremendous returns against the dollars that we spend against our brands.

Good morning, and Happy New Year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took.
Before I jump into my prepared remarks, let me first acknowledge the disheartening and tragic events that unfolded in our nation's Capitol yesterday. I join other leaders across the country in condemning the violence that occurred. Instead, calling for a peaceful transfer of power that upholds our democracy and calling for peace, unity and stability as we move forward as a nation.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our business performance. 2020 was certainly a challenging year. And like many of you, we are happy to turn the page. As we do so, I'm mindful of the words of American novelist James Lane Allen who said, ""Adversity does not build character, it reveals it."" This is certainly the case for us. Our team rose to meet many challenges that surfaced in 2020. This included overcoming many negative impacts from COVID, most notably, a significant volume reduction in the on-premise, a slowdown in production of our Mexican beer portfolio heading into our busiest selling season and threats to the safety, health and well-being of our team members.
Despite all that, we continued to build momentum for our high-performing beer brands and launched Corona Hard Seltzer just as the pandemic started to gain steam in the U.S. Impressively, this remains one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. We continue to transform our Wine & Spirits business, leveraging innovation to drive higher growth and margin performance while investing in capabilities needed to win long term, such as DTC and 3-tier eCommerce. And successfully working through the complexities of our transaction with Gallo, which, now that it is complete, positions our Wine & Spirits business to become a more meaningful contributor to our overall growth profile.
And we've also supported our communities by providing much needed assistance to those impacted by COVID and West Coast fires, by taking steps to achieve greater racial equity within our company, our industry and our surrounding communities, by once again earning recognition from the Corporate Equality Index as a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ community and by improving our carbon disclosure project ratings for climate and water stewardship.
While 2020 will be remembered for many things, what I will remember most is the character that was revealed by our leaders and team. Preventative measures implemented across our business helped mitigate impacts related to COVID while maintaining full employment resource levels. I continue to be inspired by their resilience, focus and determination for driving the success of our business, and this bodes extremely well for our future. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, our business partners, we delivered excellent third quarter results.
As Garth and I run through the highlights of the quarter, there are 3 things that I ask you to keep in mind. Number one, our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth, remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. Consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust. The introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer has exceeded our expectations, and we're back to gaining share in IRI as we continue to recover from the slowdown in production earlier this year due to COVID. Number two, the completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of our lower end wine brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability, driving focus more fully on a tighter set of powerful brands that already have traction with consumers. And number three, despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals.
I'm proud to say that our business remains healthy, allowing us to provide fiscal '21 guidance that, I'm sure you will agree, reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This is truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. So let's dig a little deeper with a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter.
Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down about 35% year-over-year, Constellation's beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth, delivering depletion trends of plus 12% in the quarter. And while some depletion growth we saw this quarter included benefits from inventory restocking, the portfolio delivered accelerating underlying trends that align with our sales growth projection of 7% to 9% for the foreseeable future as consumer demand remains exceptionally strong for our products across the majority of the portfolio. In fact, Constellation's beer portfolio posted IRI consumer takeaway dollar growth of more than 15% for the third quarter.
As you know, the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier this year has impacted this year's shipment and volume net sales trends. The good news is that we've returned to a position of gaining share in IRI tracked channels as we continue to replenish inventories to more normal levels, which we expect to accomplish by fiscal year-end, a process that's actually taken a little longer than originally planned due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands.
So let's take a deeper dive into the key brands that drove these excellent trends for our beer business. The Corona brand family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels led by particularly strong contributions from Corona Premier, Corona Hard Seltzer and Corona Extra. With the launch of only one, one SKU to date, Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations and remains in a strong #4 position in the hard seltzer category. It also has the distinction of being the second fastest moving hard seltzer among major seltzer brands while continuing to maintain strong incrementality levels at nearly 90%.
Early next fiscal year, we plan to launch Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which will offer consumers the same great Corona taste and refreshment attributes while expanding to new flavors, including pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit. Variety Pack #2 will be followed shortly thereafter by the introduction of another exciting new hard seltzer initiative. We believe these product launches will help further strengthen our competitive position in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, broaden our distribution reach and enhance our market share in the high end of the U.S. beer market. These initiatives will be supported with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build upon our hard seltzer portfolio.
2020 marked the 30th consecutive year of Corona's iconic O' Tannenpalm commercial that it was airing on TV during the holiday season. As the longest-running beer commercial of all time, O' Tannenpalm demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Corona brand, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which continues to resonate with consumers and remains one of the most beloved consumer brands in the world.
Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the #1 spot as the top share gaining imported beer in the U.S. beer category with depletion growth of almost 20%. Modelo continues to gain traction with general market consumers while sustaining momentum with its core Hispanic consumer, driven by the authenticity of the brand and our marketing efforts. The success of Modelo has been driven in part by impactful marketing initiatives that include high-profile sports programming with the NFL, NBA, NCAA Football, Spanish language soccer as well as an ongoing presence on Facebook and Instagram.
Finally, Pacifico was also a top share gainer within the import segment during the quarter, continuing its strong momentum with depletion growth of nearly 20%. We remain excited about the future growth prospects for this brand as we continue to increase awareness and expand distribution beyond its core market of Southern California. As we've said before, Pacifico has all the makings of the next big brand in our beer portfolio.
From an operational perspective, we plan to complete the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility in early fiscal '22, which is a slight delay versus our original plans due to pandemic-related construction slowdowns for this project last year. After the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term, which includes more than doubling our seltzer production capacity heading into the next fiscal year.
Overall, our excellent year-to-date results provide confidence in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales growth in fiscal '21. In addition, we have increased our operating income growth target to 8% to 10% for the year. Now let's move on to the quarterly results for our Wine & Spirits business.
As I mentioned earlier, the closure of the Gallo deal and other pending transactions will include a series of actions which positions our Wine & Spirits business for accelerated revenue growth and operating margin performance going forward. We are grateful for the dedication of our Constellation team and the support and collaboration from Gallo and our business partners as we ensure a smooth transition.
With the completion of the divestitures, we believe the Wine & Spirits business is positioned to grow net sales low to mid-single digits while producing operating income growth ahead of net sales growth as the business works to take out stranded costs and execute against other cost, price/mix and efficiency improvements to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. In the near term, we expect the remaining portfolio post the Gallo deal to generate fiscal '21 net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range.
With these transactions now behind us, our team can more fully concentrate resources and focus behind a smaller set of more premium brands to better align with consumer-led premiumization trends. During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of these trends as premiumization continues to drive elevated growth across the total beverage alcohol segment, further reinforcing the transformation strategy for our business.
Our higher-end wine power brands at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high end wine category IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. Overall, we expect these brands to be key growth drivers of the business long term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth, higher-margin brands. During the quarter, successful new innovation initiatives also contributed to top line growth, with power brand introductions like The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, which has become this year's biggest ultra-premium wine introduction in IRI channels based on dollar sales.
In addition, several other innovation initiatives launched earlier this year continued to gain traction and drive growth, including brands like Unshackled from The Prisoner Wine portfolio, Kim Crawford Illuminate and Woodbridge spirits barrel-aged varietals just to name a few. And let's not forget Woodbridge wine go packs, which became the #2 innovation this year in IRI channels based on dollar sales.
We are also successfully driving our digital commerce initiatives which are gaining momentum. Since our acquisition of Empathy Wines, we have continued to make significant progress in leveraging their unique platform and capabilities across our portfolio within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce space. We have launched several new DTC sites leveraging the Empathy platform, including The Prisoner Wine Company, Double Diamond and SIMI. We believe this category will be a meaningful pillar of growth for Constellation in the future.
In fact, our wine power brands competing in the eCommerce space are outpacing the overall wine category as our early investment in the category is providing us with a meaningful first-mover advantage. During the quarter, we became the first CPG company to partner with Instacart to feature our products on Facebook ads, propelling Constellation to the next level of 3-tier eCommerce media by enabling us to refine and optimize our ad creative and targeting based on real-time data. Furthermore, it is important to our growth and margin profile that we continue to invest in this space since DTC is heavily weighted toward the higher end of the wine category, as wines priced $20 and up make up nearly 90% of total DTC sales.
Now moving on to a discussion of our investment in Canopy Growth. We're pleased with the progress the Canopy Growth team has made in defining and strategically positioning themselves in the U.S. CBD and legal THC cannabis markets, which will be beneficial upon U.S. federal permissibility, which was probably enhanced with the change in the Senate that's occurred in the last 48 hours.
Canopy's core BioSteel beverages are now the official sports drink of the Dallas Mavericks, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors and has several standout athlete and influencer partners, including the reigning NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes. In fact, Canopy predicts that CBD beverages can grow at a 35% CAGR through 2025 as consumer realize the compelling benefits from CBD beverages. In addition, BioSteel now has 2 exclusive partnerships with Manhattan Beer and the Reyes Beer Division, 2 key Constellation distributors, which will give Canopy the ability to gain traction in the U.S. market well ahead of its competitors in the emerging CBD space.
In September, Canopy launched a Martha Stewart branded CBD product line which is available on shopcanopy.com and several other outlets, including its new national distribution agreement with The Vitamin Shoppe retail locations, just in time for the holidays. Canopy will continue to seek strategic partnerships like the one with Martha Stewart to drive consumer awareness for these products. Overall, we believe that Canopy will be a significant long-term growth opportunity for Constellation, and we believe they remain best positioned to win long term in the emerging cannabis space.
In closing, I want to take you back to the key takeaways mentioned earlier. I'm extremely proud of the results of our team and what they have driven in the face of continued adversity. Our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth, remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. The completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of lower end brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability.
Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. Our excellent third quarter performance drove strong cash generation, which, coupled with the finalization of the Gallo deal, enhances the financial profile of our business, enables further debt reduction and allows us to continue to execute our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal '23. Our business remains extremely healthy, and these strong results are truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Garth?"

Spe",2652,"Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone.
Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Specifically, during our third quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth, of $3.16, an increase of 32% versus prior year, delivered strong operating margin and accelerating double-digit depletion growth for our beer business and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 14% and 23%, respectively, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and achievement of targeted net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings, as we ended the quarter at 3.3x.
As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have closed the transaction to sell a portion of our Wine & Spirits business to Gallo, including the Nobilo Wine brand, as well as closing the transaction to sell our concentrate business to Vie-Del. As an update, we expect to close the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy transaction within the next several weeks. Post transaction closing, we are left with a more focused and premium portfolio, which nicely positions our Wine & Spirits business to produce low to mid-single-digit top line growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30% in the medium term.
In total, at transaction close, Constellation received cash of approximately $560 million and the opportunity to receive up to $250 million in earn-outs if brand performance targets are met over a 2-year period after closing. We also received approximately $130 million related to the closing of the Nobilo deal and expect to receive approximately $265 million from Sazerac upon closing the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy deal.
In total, from all transactions, we expect to receive approximately $955 million before tax, and we expect the overall tax payments related to the transactions to be approximately $50 million, which are expected to be paid in fiscal '22. The cash proceeds from these transactions will facilitate further debt reduction so we can continue to execute on our commitment to lower our leverage ratio and to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023.
The cash proceeds received from Gallo reflect a significant inventory adjustment. Due to the prolonged timing of the Gallo deal, we were able to sell through a significant amount of finished goods inventory that was originally slated to go to Gallo. Also, as indicated last quarter, we have flexibility in how we source grapes to mitigate any shortages due to the wildfires. As a result, we decided to retain a portion of bulk wine inventory as we had a higher and better use for it as a replacement for smoke-tainted bulk resulting from the wildfires. Those 2 factors resulted in substantial cash flow for Constellation throughout the fiscal year.
Before we jump into the quarterly financial results, I'd like to provide an update on guidance. Due to the continued resiliency of our business and further clarity of the operating environment, we have issued fiscal 2021 EPS guidance and are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to range between $9.80 and $10.05. This range excludes future Canopy equity in earnings impact and accounts for the respective timing of the previous mentioned deal closures.
Now let's review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Net sales increased 28% on shipment volume growth of 27%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 30% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 28% and favorable price and mix.
Depletion volume for the quarter accelerated and achieved 12% growth as inventory levels improved and strong performance continued in the off-premise channel, which more than offset the impact of approximately 35% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. Depletions in the quarter benefited by approximately 3 to 4 points driven by inventory restocking.
While underlying consumer demand for our products remain strong, the robust shipment and depletion volume growth experienced during the quarter was enhanced by inventory replenishment at both the distributor and retailer level as product inventories begin to rebuild from a COVID-related slowdown of Mexican beer production earlier in the fiscal year. This resulted in Q3 year-to-date organic shipment and depletion volume growth of approximately 6% to 7%, which is in line with our medium-term goals and accounts for volume timing between quarters. Due to continued robust consumer demand, product inventories are now expected to return to historically normal levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as shipment volume is expected to continue to outpace depletion volume for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 330 basis points versus prior year to 42.6%. Benefits from marketing and SGA as a percent of net sales, foreign exchange and the Ballast Point divestiture more than offset unfavorable operational and logistics costs. The increase in operational cost was driven primarily by higher material costs, brewery compensation and benefits and depreciation, while the increased logistics cost resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments from our breweries in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption.
On an absolute dollar basis, marketing dollars spent during the quarter increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable leverage driven by increased throughput at our breweries, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 9.3%. We now expect full year fiscal '21 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 9.5% range.
Now let's discuss balance of year expectations and full year fiscal '21 beer guidance. We expect net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio. Excluding the impact of Ballast Point, we expect organic net sales to land in the higher end of the 7% to 9% range. We now expect fiscal '21 operating income growth of 8% to 10%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance provided during the quarter. Furthermore, we expect full year operating margin to range between 40% and 41%, achieving margin expansion versus prior year operating margin of 40%.
Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a margin perspective as the beer segment will experience some headwinds during the quarter. First, as a reminder, we took selective price increases this fall as we decided to stagger our annual price increases. And in some instances, these increases will shift in the beginning of our fiscal '22. As a result, we saw pricing favorability muted in Q3 which will continue in Q4.
Second, from a COGS perspective, we will continue to incur incremental shipping costs due to actions we're taking to accelerate the replenishment of inventory across the network. We also expect margin headwinds related to incremental headcount driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which is now expected to be completed in early fiscal '22.
Lastly, we expect increased marketing spend to be the largest headwind to margins in the fourth quarter, driven by the shift in spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year. Our Q4 investment will focus on incremental media in both the NFL and NBA, incremental digital media and continued support behind Corona Hard Seltzer, which includes a holiday spot, leveraging the equity of the iconic Corona Extra O' Tannenpalm ad. These incremental investments made during the holiday season and into the beginning of the calendar year will provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season.
Moving to Wine & Spirits. Q3 power brand depletion volume accelerated and achieved nearly 4% growth as these brands continue to win in the higher end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. wine category. Overall depletion volume declined 1%, which reflect the brands recently divested.
Wine & Spirits net sales increased 10% on shipment volume up 3%, driven by our power brands as well as strong innovation contributions. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Q3 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands recently divested driven by the timing of the Gallo deal.
Operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 24% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS and increased marketing driven by the shift in spend from the first half. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million, resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the wildfires. This came in slightly favorable versus what we originally anticipated and guided for the quarter. However, we still expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs in Q4 associated with unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the wildfires.
During the quarter, we also recognized a $26.5 million loss in connection with the write-down of certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the wildfires. However, these costs were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses from grapes from our own vineyards, and we're actively pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers. As we continue to work through our processes, additional write-downs of certain bulk wine inventory may be needed for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, which would be excluded from comparable basis results as well. As a reminder, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products.
Even though margins for the segment took a step back during Q3, the underlying fundamentals of our consumer-led premiumization strategy continue to shine through as significant mix and price were generated during the quarter. Strong shipment volume mix was driven by some of our fastest moving power brands such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner brand family, and we're continuing to see benefits from the pricing actions we took on both Woodbridge and SVEDKA at the beginning of the fiscal year.
Moving along to balance of the year expectations and full year fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits guidance. We now expect fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 9% to 11% and 16% to 18%, respectively, which reflects the closing of the Gallo transaction, including Nobilo and the concentrate transaction as well as the Paul Masson divestiture. In addition, we expect the retained portfolio post divestitures to grow net sales in the 2% to 4% range this year.
Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a Wine & Spirits segment perspective. For Q4, we expect power brand depletion volumes to be muted due to the following: first, we are lapping strong Q4 fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1. Second, we are also lapping solid Q4 fiscal '20 innovation driven by the rollout of Unshackled. And finally, we are continuing our efforts to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states to allow for better inventory management going forward.
Also, let me provide an update on marketing cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. In the first half of the fiscal year, reduced marketing spend provided margin benefits due to timing as we shifted spend from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year. Originally, we expected a majority of the shift to impact Q3. However, we now expect the shift in spend to be more equally distributed between Q3 and Q4. We are also expecting incremental investment in Q4, creating strong support for our power brands as we propel our momentum into fiscal '22. This will result in an increase in year-over-year spend for Q4.
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $171 million, up 15% versus Q3 year-to-date last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. We now expect full year corporate expense to approximate $240 million.
This is a good spot to provide an update on our SAP S/4HANA implementation. I'm excited to announce that the final phase of our SAP implementation is scheduled to go live on March 1, 2021. We have various business continuity processes and resources in place to ensure this transition goes as smoothly as possible and look forward to updating everybody on our efforts during our Q4 call. As a reminder, we expect corporate expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease by the end of fiscal '22 once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented and we begin to eliminate redundant IT costs, allowing us to realize benefits of the new platform.
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 7% to approximately $96 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Fiscal '21 interest expense is now expected to approximate $390 million.
Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 17.7% versus 17.5% in Q3 last year primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. As indicated last quarter, we expect our full year fiscal '21 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity in earnings impact, to approximate 19%, which would imply an increase in the Q4 tax rate driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits.
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the first 9 months of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 23% increase and reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We are projecting full year fiscal '21 CapEx spend to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes $650 million to $750 million of beer CapEx as we expect an acceleration of spend during Q4, driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon. Furthermore, we expect fiscal '21 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion.
Moving to Canopy. In Q3, we recognized a $770 million increase in fair value of our Canopy investment. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $834 million, which increased significantly from Q2 driven by Canopy's robust share price movement during the quarter.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we've navigated through a challenging and volatile economic environment throughout the first 9 months of our fiscal year, we believed it was financially prudent to focus on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. As a result of our strong cash generation profile, we've reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion since the end of fiscal '20, which has led to further reduction of our leverage ratio to our target range. These financial strides, coupled with the fact that our business has continued to remain resilient through this economic environment, now provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic and resume share repurchase activity in the near term as we remain fully committed to our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23. We are also pleased that the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases.
And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

And keep in mind, that's all being done, which relates to your second question, with on-premise trends that are really not very good. Year-to-date, on-premise for our beer business is off 53%.
So I think the fact that we have produced these kinds of results with that environment speaks to the strength of our beer portfolio and the long-term positioning that we have for those brands.

So let me just give you some of the elements that make up that.
As we said, the biggest driver of that is going to be marketing because we think it's important that we continue to spend behind the brands and support the brands, particularly Corona Hard Seltzer. And so there's going to be a significant increase in marketing spend in Q4. Additionally, we have a couple of COGS-related headwinds in Q4. One is, as we've had even in Q3, which is freight and logistics as we're doing things to expedite shipments into the U.S. to ensure that we're increasing our inventory levels to more historical levels. And then furthermore, under COGS, we also have increased headcount in Obregon as we get ready to turn on the next 5 million hectoliters of capacity at Obregon. And we also in Q4 have some brewery maintenance that we shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And then finally, the last thing is just as we talked about, the staggered pricing increases that we've taken this year, which we staggered them through Q3 and Q4 and some will flow into the first quarter of next year. So all of those together is what's leading to a bit of a giveback on margins in Q4."

Funky Buddha in Florida has performed extraordinarily well in the seltzer category in that particular market, and we are extending that some in the coming year. We have a minority investment in PRESS, which has also done extremely well in the seltzer category. So we have our toes in the water in a number of ways.

So I think we need to think about the Light business in conjunction with what we are doing across the overall light category, Premier, Corona Light, et cetera. And I think, obviously, Light has been hurt some. However, the trends actually have been quite good during this COVID time frame."

So I still think it remains a very strong growth category. It grew, if you remember on our call last year, we anticipated or I made the comment that I thought it would at least double in 2020 calendar year. And in fact, it did more than that as a category, and we still see strong trends. So we think this is going to continue to be a growth category, although it's obviously, like any other category, it's difficult to continue to grow at the pace that they've been growing."

Obviously, now that we have been able to raise our production rates and we are filling in some of those scenarios that had occurred, we're quite pleased that we're maintaining and in fact, growing our distribution platform going forward.

First of all, given there's been some change in how the consumer purchases, more DTC, more 3-tier eCommerce, consumers are going with brands that are tried and true, and we're fortunate to have some that are extremely well received. You noted a couple of them. Meiomi has done extremely well, Kim, The Prisoner Wine Company. These are brands that are trusted by consumers and loved by consumers. And that certainly helped the process, particularly as people's shopping patterns change some.
Secondly, our innovation agenda has worked extremely well. Things that we did earlier in the year, like Unshackled, has done very well as well as some of the newer things that we've done. We noted in my brief prepared remarks that Meiomi cabernet sauvignon is one of the strongest individual entries that occurred in the entire industry this past year. And you add into that, The Prisoner cabernet and The Prisoner chardonnay, we did very well with our innovation agenda as well. And I don't think we have seen, I would slightly disagree with your comment that there's been a more aggressive environment or an aggressive promotional environment. Fortunately, the robust demand that we've seen in many of our power brands above $11, where we had lots of double-digit growers, our demand has been very strong, and that has been the single biggest driver of our improved wine results is the sheer demand for our products. And the fact that the consumer is looking for our brands and products that they have great faith in, especially as their shopping patterns have changed some."

Remember, we had roughly 15% growth across the beer portfolio in IRI during the quarter, extremely robust growth, especially given the fact that on-premise was a drag to say the least. Fortunately, again, we are a little less susceptible to the on-premise than some of the overall marketplace, but the sheer strength of our brands was a critical factor.
No question, some of the depletion pieces Garth noted in his remarks were driven by our replacing some of the inventory that had decreased during the time when we were not able to produce. But I think we do need to keep in mind, at the end of the day, it's all about consumer takeout, and consumers are strongly demanding our critical brands."

Good morning, and Happy New Year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took.
Before I jump into my prepared remarks, let me first acknowledge the disheartening and tragic events that unfolded in our nation's Capitol yesterday. I join other leaders across the country in condemning the violence that occurred. Instead, calling for a peaceful transfer of power that upholds our democracy and calling for peace, unity and stability as we move forward as a nation.
Now let's move on to a discussion of our business performance. 2020 was certainly a challenging year. And like many of you, we are happy to turn the page. As we do so, I'm mindful of the words of American novelist James Lane Allen who said, ""Adversity does not build character, it reveals it."" This is certainly the case for us. Our team rose to meet many challenges that surfaced in 2020. This included overcoming many negative impacts from COVID, most notably, a significant volume reduction in the on-premise, a slowdown in production of our Mexican beer portfolio heading into our busiest selling season and threats to the safety, health and well-being of our team members.
Despite all that, we continued to build momentum for our high-performing beer brands and launched Corona Hard Seltzer just as the pandemic started to gain steam in the U.S. Impressively, this remains one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. We continue to transform our Wine & Spirits business, leveraging innovation to drive higher growth and margin performance while investing in capabilities needed to win long term, such as DTC and 3-tier eCommerce. And successfully working through the complexities of our transaction with Gallo, which, now that it is complete, positions our Wine & Spirits business to become a more meaningful contributor to our overall growth profile.
And we've also supported our communities by providing much needed assistance to those impacted by COVID and West Coast fires, by taking steps to achieve greater racial equity within our company, our industry and our surrounding communities, by once again earning recognition from the Corporate Equality Index as a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ community and by improving our carbon disclosure project ratings for climate and water stewardship.
While 2020 will be remembered for many things, what I will remember most is the character that was revealed by our leaders and team. Preventative measures implemented across our business helped mitigate impacts related to COVID while maintaining full employment resource levels. I continue to be inspired by their resilience, focus and determination for driving the success of our business, and this bodes extremely well for our future. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, our business partners, we delivered excellent third quarter results.
As Garth and I run through the highlights of the quarter, there are 3 things that I ask you to keep in mind. Number one, our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth, remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. Consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust. The introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer has exceeded our expectations, and we're back to gaining share in IRI as we continue to recover from the slowdown in production earlier this year due to COVID. Number two, the completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of our lower end wine brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability, driving focus more fully on a tighter set of powerful brands that already have traction with consumers. And number three, despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals.
I'm proud to say that our business remains healthy, allowing us to provide fiscal '21 guidance that, I'm sure you will agree, reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This is truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. So let's dig a little deeper with a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter.
Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down about 35% year-over-year, Constellation's beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth, delivering depletion trends of plus 12% in the quarter. And while some depletion growth we saw this quarter included benefits from inventory restocking, the portfolio delivered accelerating underlying trends that align with our sales growth projection of 7% to 9% for the foreseeable future as consumer demand remains exceptionally strong for our products across the majority of the portfolio. In fact, Constellation's beer portfolio posted IRI consumer takeaway dollar growth of more than 15% for the third quarter.
As you know, the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier this year has impacted this year's shipment and volume net sales trends. The good news is that we've returned to a position of gaining share in IRI tracked channels as we continue to replenish inventories to more normal levels, which we expect to accomplish by fiscal year-end, a process that's actually taken a little longer than originally planned due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands.
So let's take a deeper dive into the key brands that drove these excellent trends for our beer business. The Corona brand family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels led by particularly strong contributions from Corona Premier, Corona Hard Seltzer and Corona Extra. With the launch of only one, one SKU to date, Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations and remains in a strong #4 position in the hard seltzer category. It also has the distinction of being the second fastest moving hard seltzer among major seltzer brands while continuing to maintain strong incrementality levels at nearly 90%.
Early next fiscal year, we plan to launch Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which will offer consumers the same great Corona taste and refreshment attributes while expanding to new flavors, including pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit. Variety Pack #2 will be followed shortly thereafter by the introduction of another exciting new hard seltzer initiative. We believe these product launches will help further strengthen our competitive position in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, broaden our distribution reach and enhance our market share in the high end of the U.S. beer market. These initiatives will be supported with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build upon our hard seltzer portfolio.
2020 marked the 30th consecutive year of Corona's iconic O' Tannenpalm commercial that it was airing on TV during the holiday season. As the longest-running beer commercial of all time, O' Tannenpalm demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Corona brand, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which continues to resonate with consumers and remains one of the most beloved consumer brands in the world.
Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the #1 spot as the top share gaining imported beer in the U.S. beer category with depletion growth of almost 20%. Modelo continues to gain traction with general market consumers while sustaining momentum with its core Hispanic consumer, driven by the authenticity of the brand and our marketing efforts. The success of Modelo has been driven in part by impactful marketing initiatives that include high-profile sports programming with the NFL, NBA, NCAA Football, Spanish language soccer as well as an ongoing presence on Facebook and Instagram.
Finally, Pacifico was also a top share gainer within the import segment during the quarter, continuing its strong momentum with depletion growth of nearly 20%. We remain excited about the future growth prospects for this brand as we continue to increase awareness and expand distribution beyond its core market of Southern California. As we've said before, Pacifico has all the makings of the next big brand in our beer portfolio.
From an operational perspective, we plan to complete the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility in early fiscal '22, which is a slight delay versus our original plans due to pandemic-related construction slowdowns for this project last year. After the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term, which includes more than doubling our seltzer production capacity heading into the next fiscal year.
Overall, our excellent year-to-date results provide confidence in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales growth in fiscal '21. In addition, we have increased our operating income growth target to 8% to 10% for the year. Now let's move on to the quarterly results for our Wine & Spirits business.
As I mentioned earlier, the closure of the Gallo deal and other pending transactions will include a series of actions which positions our Wine & Spirits business for accelerated revenue growth and operating margin performance going forward. We are grateful for the dedication of our Constellation team and the support and collaboration from Gallo and our business partners as we ensure a smooth transition.
With the completion of the divestitures, we believe the Wine & Spirits business is positioned to grow net sales low to mid-single digits while producing operating income growth ahead of net sales growth as the business works to take out stranded costs and execute against other cost, price/mix and efficiency improvements to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. In the near term, we expect the remaining portfolio post the Gallo deal to generate fiscal '21 net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range.
With these transactions now behind us, our team can more fully concentrate resources and focus behind a smaller set of more premium brands to better align with consumer-led premiumization trends. During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of these trends as premiumization continues to drive elevated growth across the total beverage alcohol segment, further reinforcing the transformation strategy for our business.
Our higher-end wine power brands at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high end wine category IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. Overall, we expect these brands to be key growth drivers of the business long term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth, higher-margin brands. During the quarter, successful new innovation initiatives also contributed to top line growth, with power brand introductions like The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, which has become this year's biggest ultra-premium wine introduction in IRI channels based on dollar sales.
In addition, several other innovation initiatives launched earlier this year continued to gain traction and drive growth, including brands like Unshackled from The Prisoner Wine portfolio, Kim Crawford Illuminate and Woodbridge spirits barrel-aged varietals just to name a few. And let's not forget Woodbridge wine go packs, which became the #2 innovation this year in IRI channels based on dollar sales.
We are also successfully driving our digital commerce initiatives which are gaining momentum. Since our acquisition of Empathy Wines, we have continued to make significant progress in leveraging their unique platform and capabilities across our portfolio within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce space. We have launched several new DTC sites leveraging the Empathy platform, including The Prisoner Wine Company, Double Diamond and SIMI. We believe this category will be a meaningful pillar of growth for Constellation in the future.
In fact, our wine power brands competing in the eCommerce space are outpacing the overall wine category as our early investment in the category is providing us with a meaningful first-mover advantage. During the quarter, we became the first CPG company to partner with Instacart to feature our products on Facebook ads, propelling Constellation to the next level of 3-tier eCommerce media by enabling us to refine and optimize our ad creative and targeting based on real-time data. Furthermore, it is important to our growth and margin profile that we continue to invest in this space since DTC is heavily weighted toward the higher end of the wine category, as wines priced $20 and up make up nearly 90% of total DTC sales.
Now moving on to a discussion of our investment in Canopy Growth. We're pleased with the progress the Canopy Growth team has made in defining and strategically positioning themselves in the U.S. CBD and legal THC cannabis markets, which will be beneficial upon U.S. federal permissibility, which was probably enhanced with the change in the Senate that's occurred in the last 48 hours.
Canopy's core BioSteel beverages are now the official sports drink of the Dallas Mavericks, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors and has several standout athlete and influencer partners, including the reigning NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes. In fact, Canopy predicts that CBD beverages can grow at a 35% CAGR through 2025 as consumer realize the compelling benefits from CBD beverages. In addition, BioSteel now has 2 exclusive partnerships with Manhattan Beer and the Reyes Beer Division, 2 key Constellation distributors, which will give Canopy the ability to gain traction in the U.S. market well ahead of its competitors in the emerging CBD space.
In September, Canopy launched a Martha Stewart branded CBD product line which is available on shopcanopy.com and several other outlets, including its new national distribution agreement with The Vitamin Shoppe retail locations, just in time for the holidays. Canopy will continue to seek strategic partnerships like the one with Martha Stewart to drive consumer awareness for these products. Overall, we believe that Canopy will be a significant long-term growth opportunity for Constellation, and we believe they remain best positioned to win long term in the emerging cannabis space.
In closing, I want to take you back to the key takeaways mentioned earlier. I'm extremely proud of the results of our team and what they have driven in the face of continued adversity. Our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth, remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. The completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of lower end brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability.
Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. Our excellent third quarter performance drove strong cash generation, which, coupled with the finalization of the Gallo deal, enhances the financial profile of our business, enables further debt reduction and allows us to continue to execute our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal '23. Our business remains extremely healthy, and these strong results are truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Garth?"
258589,696944452,2247295,"Constellation Brands, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2021",2021-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone.Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Spe",2652,"Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone.
Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Specifically, during our third quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth, of $3.16, an increase of 32% versus prior year, delivered strong operating margin and accelerating double-digit depletion growth for our beer business and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 14% and 23%, respectively, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and achievement of targeted net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings, as we ended the quarter at 3.3x.
As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have closed the transaction to sell a portion of our Wine & Spirits business to Gallo, including the Nobilo Wine brand, as well as closing the transaction to sell our concentrate business to Vie-Del. As an update, we expect to close the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy transaction within the next several weeks. Post transaction closing, we are left with a more focused and premium portfolio, which nicely positions our Wine & Spirits business to produce low to mid-single-digit top line growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30% in the medium term.
In total, at transaction close, Constellation received cash of approximately $560 million and the opportunity to receive up to $250 million in earn-outs if brand performance targets are met over a 2-year period after closing. We also received approximately $130 million related to the closing of the Nobilo deal and expect to receive approximately $265 million from Sazerac upon closing the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy deal.
In total, from all transactions, we expect to receive approximately $955 million before tax, and we expect the overall tax payments related to the transactions to be approximately $50 million, which are expected to be paid in fiscal '22. The cash proceeds from these transactions will facilitate further debt reduction so we can continue to execute on our commitment to lower our leverage ratio and to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023.
The cash proceeds received from Gallo reflect a significant inventory adjustment. Due to the prolonged timing of the Gallo deal, we were able to sell through a significant amount of finished goods inventory that was originally slated to go to Gallo. Also, as indicated last quarter, we have flexibility in how we source grapes to mitigate any shortages due to the wildfires. As a result, we decided to retain a portion of bulk wine inventory as we had a higher and better use for it as a replacement for smoke-tainted bulk resulting from the wildfires. Those 2 factors resulted in substantial cash flow for Constellation throughout the fiscal year.
Before we jump into the quarterly financial results, I'd like to provide an update on guidance. Due to the continued resiliency of our business and further clarity of the operating environment, we have issued fiscal 2021 EPS guidance and are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to range between $9.80 and $10.05. This range excludes future Canopy equity in earnings impact and accounts for the respective timing of the previous mentioned deal closures.
Now let's review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Net sales increased 28% on shipment volume growth of 27%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 30% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 28% and favorable price and mix.
Depletion volume for the quarter accelerated and achieved 12% growth as inventory levels improved and strong performance continued in the off-premise channel, which more than offset the impact of approximately 35% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. Depletions in the quarter benefited by approximately 3 to 4 points driven by inventory restocking.
While underlying consumer demand for our products remain strong, the robust shipment and depletion volume growth experienced during the quarter was enhanced by inventory replenishment at both the distributor and retailer level as product inventories begin to rebuild from a COVID-related slowdown of Mexican beer production earlier in the fiscal year. This resulted in Q3 year-to-date organic shipment and depletion volume growth of approximately 6% to 7%, which is in line with our medium-term goals and accounts for volume timing between quarters. Due to continued robust consumer demand, product inventories are now expected to return to historically normal levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as shipment volume is expected to continue to outpace depletion volume for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 330 basis points versus prior year to 42.6%. Benefits from marketing and SGA as a percent of net sales, foreign exchange and the Ballast Point divestiture more than offset unfavorable operational and logistics costs. The increase in operational cost was driven primarily by higher material costs, brewery compensation and benefits and depreciation, while the increased logistics cost resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments from our breweries in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption.
On an absolute dollar basis, marketing dollars spent during the quarter increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable leverage driven by increased throughput at our breweries, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 9.3%. We now expect full year fiscal '21 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 9.5% range.
Now let's discuss balance of year expectations and full year fiscal '21 beer guidance. We expect net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio. Excluding the impact of Ballast Point, we expect organic net sales to land in the higher end of the 7% to 9% range. We now expect fiscal '21 operating income growth of 8% to 10%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance provided during the quarter. Furthermore, we expect full year operating margin to range between 40% and 41%, achieving margin expansion versus prior year operating margin of 40%.
Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a margin perspective as the beer segment will experience some headwinds during the quarter. First, as a reminder, we took selective price increases this fall as we decided to stagger our annual price increases. And in some instances, these increases will shift in the beginning of our fiscal '22. As a result, we saw pricing favorability muted in Q3 which will continue in Q4.
Second, from a COGS perspective, we will continue to incur incremental shipping costs due to actions we're taking to accelerate the replenishment of inventory across the network. We also expect margin headwinds related to incremental headcount driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which is now expected to be completed in early fiscal '22.
Lastly, we expect increased marketing spend to be the largest headwind to margins in the fourth quarter, driven by the shift in spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year. Our Q4 investment will focus on incremental media in both the NFL and NBA, incremental digital media and continued support behind Corona Hard Seltzer, which includes a holiday spot, leveraging the equity of the iconic Corona Extra O' Tannenpalm ad. These incremental investments made during the holiday season and into the beginning of the calendar year will provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season.
Moving to Wine & Spirits. Q3 power brand depletion volume accelerated and achieved nearly 4% growth as these brands continue to win in the higher end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. wine category. Overall depletion volume declined 1%, which reflect the brands recently divested.
Wine & Spirits net sales increased 10% on shipment volume up 3%, driven by our power brands as well as strong innovation contributions. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Q3 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands recently divested driven by the timing of the Gallo deal.
Operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 24% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS and increased marketing driven by the shift in spend from the first half. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million, resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the wildfires. This came in slightly favorable versus what we originally anticipated and guided for the quarter. However, we still expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs in Q4 associated with unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the wildfires.
During the quarter, we also recognized a $26.5 million loss in connection with the write-down of certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the wildfires. However, these costs were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses from grapes from our own vineyards, and we're actively pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers. As we continue to work through our processes, additional write-downs of certain bulk wine inventory may be needed for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, which would be excluded from comparable basis results as well. As a reminder, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products.
Even though margins for the segment took a step back during Q3, the underlying fundamentals of our consumer-led premiumization strategy continue to shine through as significant mix and price were generated during the quarter. Strong shipment volume mix was driven by some of our fastest moving power brands such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner brand family, and we're continuing to see benefits from the pricing actions we took on both Woodbridge and SVEDKA at the beginning of the fiscal year.
Moving along to balance of the year expectations and full year fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits guidance. We now expect fiscal '21 Wine & Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 9% to 11% and 16% to 18%, respectively, which reflects the closing of the Gallo transaction, including Nobilo and the concentrate transaction as well as the Paul Masson divestiture. In addition, we expect the retained portfolio post divestitures to grow net sales in the 2% to 4% range this year.
Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a Wine & Spirits segment perspective. For Q4, we expect power brand depletion volumes to be muted due to the following: first, we are lapping strong Q4 fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1. Second, we are also lapping solid Q4 fiscal '20 innovation driven by the rollout of Unshackled. And finally, we are continuing our efforts to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states to allow for better inventory management going forward.
Also, let me provide an update on marketing cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. In the first half of the fiscal year, reduced marketing spend provided margin benefits due to timing as we shifted spend from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year. Originally, we expected a majority of the shift to impact Q3. However, we now expect the shift in spend to be more equally distributed between Q3 and Q4. We are also expecting incremental investment in Q4, creating strong support for our power brands as we propel our momentum into fiscal '22. This will result in an increase in year-over-year spend for Q4.
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $171 million, up 15% versus Q3 year-to-date last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. We now expect full year corporate expense to approximate $240 million.
This is a good spot to provide an update on our SAP S/4HANA implementation. I'm excited to announce that the final phase of our SAP implementation is scheduled to go live on March 1, 2021. We have various business continuity processes and resources in place to ensure this transition goes as smoothly as possible and look forward to updating everybody on our efforts during our Q4 call. As a reminder, we expect corporate expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease by the end of fiscal '22 once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented and we begin to eliminate redundant IT costs, allowing us to realize benefits of the new platform.
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 7% to approximately $96 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Fiscal '21 interest expense is now expected to approximate $390 million.
Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 17.7% versus 17.5% in Q3 last year primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. As indicated last quarter, we expect our full year fiscal '21 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity in earnings impact, to approximate 19%, which would imply an increase in the Q4 tax rate driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits.
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the first 9 months of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 23% increase and reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We are projecting full year fiscal '21 CapEx spend to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes $650 million to $750 million of beer CapEx as we expect an acceleration of spend during Q4, driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon. Furthermore, we expect fiscal '21 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion.
Moving to Canopy. In Q3, we recognized a $770 million increase in fair value of our Canopy investment. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $834 million, which increased significantly from Q2 driven by Canopy's robust share price movement during the quarter.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we've navigated through a challenging and volatile economic environment throughout the first 9 months of our fiscal year, we believed it was financially prudent to focus on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. As a result of our strong cash generation profile, we've reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion since the end of fiscal '20, which has led to further reduction of our leverage ratio to our target range. These financial strides, coupled with the fact that our business has continued to remain resilient through this economic environment, now provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic and resume share repurchase activity in the near term as we remain fully committed to our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23. We are also pleased that the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases.
And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

Although you revised it higher, it actually still implies a pretty big hit to your beer margins in Q4. So I just really wanted to better understand why this is the case, especially as I look at the easy year-over-year margin comp and even factoring in the year-over-year increase you just called out in terms of marketing spend.

So we feel really good about that margin profile, by the way. But you're right, that does imply some bit of dilution, if you will, in Q4. So let me just give you some of the elements that make up that.
As we said, the biggest driver of that is going to be marketing because we think it's important that we continue to spend behind the brands and support the brands, particularly Corona Hard Seltzer. And so there's going to be a significant increase in marketing spend in Q4. Additionally, we have a couple of COGS-related headwinds in Q4. One is, as we've had even in Q3, which is freight and logistics as we're doing things to expedite shipments into the U.S. to ensure that we're increasing our inventory levels to more historical levels. And then furthermore, under COGS, we also have increased headcount in Obregon as we get ready to turn on the next 5 million hectoliters of capacity at Obregon. And we also in Q4 have some brewery maintenance that we shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And then finally, the last thing is just as we talked about, the staggered pricing increases that we've taken this year, which we staggered them through Q3 and Q4 and some will flow into the first quarter of next year. So all of those together is what's leading to a bit of a giveback on margins in Q4."

Funky Buddha in Florida has performed extraordinarily well in the seltzer category in that particular market, and we are extending that some in the coming year. We have a minority investment in PRESS, which has also done extremely well in the seltzer category. So we have our toes in the water in a number of ways. Certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer is going to be our lead play, and we think that is where the majority of our growth in that category will come from.

And frankly, that was, as I said earlier, that was a bit better than we expected to do. So we're quite pleased with where we stand in the overall seltzer market. And certainly, with the more than doubling of capacity next year, we expect to remain a very strong player and a top 3 player in that particular segment. Keeping in mind, Nik, we have the second best velocity in the category with that particular brand with one SKU. So I think as we're able to broaden our distribution reach on the shelf, I think we'll be very pleased with where seltzer is when we're sitting here a year from now.
As it relates to Light, obviously, a lot of our work, a lot of our time and energy has been spent on Premier, which we're very excited about, continues to be a big growth profile for us. So I think we need to think about the Light business in conjunction with what we are doing across the overall light category, Premier, Corona Light, et cetera.

Secondly, our innovation agenda has worked extremely well. Things that we did earlier in the year, like Unshackled, has done very well as well as some of the newer things that we've done. We noted in my brief prepared remarks that Meiomi cabernet sauvignon is one of the strongest individual entries that occurred in the entire industry this past year.

And I don't think we have seen, I would slightly disagree with your comment that there's been a more aggressive environment or an aggressive promotional environment.

Fortunately, again, we are a little less susceptible to the on-premise than some of the overall marketplace, but the sheer strength of our brands was a critical factor.
No question, some of the depletion pieces Garth noted in his remarks were driven by our replacing some of the inventory that had decreased during the time when we were not able to produce.

And we would certainly expect to have a strong showing in the on-premise once we get back to something resembling normalcy, acknowledging that the general consensus within the industry is that we are going to have a smaller on-premise coming out of the pandemic than we had going in just because of the challenges that, unfortunately, many of our important accounts have had during the pandemic."

And I wouldn't expect maybe Canopy spending to be as inefficient as it was in Canada. But certainly, U.S. expansion requires money. And I just, I wonder if your thought process on these warrants has changed at all in the medium term because this thing could certainly pick up a bit sooner and how that factors into this renewed commitment to buybacks and just any perspective there.

So just on capital allocation in general, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we said earlier this year, which is continuing to pay down debt and getting into and maintaining levels inside our targeted leverage ratio that we're comfortable with, and we've made good progress on that this year. So far, we've brought our leverage ratio down about 59 basis points from where we started the year, about 39 basis points since the end of Q2. And we announced earlier this week the early redemption of another $500 million in notes. So we're going to -- that continues to be priority #1.
And then I will say, we are fully committed to the share repurchase program that we've previously announced, which is to return to shareholders $2.5 billion worth of capital through share repurchases by the end of our fiscal '23 as well as dividends to make up the balance. As it relates specifically to the Canopy warrants, there's still on the next batch of warrants, there's still 2 years left on those. So we don't need to make a decision anytime soon. Even with the performance of Canopy's share price, they're still not in the money. So we'll make the decision on those warrants much more closely to when they mature or to their termination date."

It's now been a little more than a year since the onset of the pandemic. And for many, it's been one of the most challenging years in recent memory.
At this time last year, we outlined our philosophy for managing the business and navigating through this period of uncertainty. We committed to making decisions that prioritize physical and economic safety, health and well-being of our employees. We committed to remaining consumer obsessed, relentlessly focused on doing all we can to meet consumer needs. We pledged to continue managing our business with discipline, ensuring appropriate balance between short-term needs and positioning Constellation for sustainable long-term success. And we pledged to continue making decisions aligned with our long-term strategic vision. This is what best-of-class companies do in periods of uncertainty, and I'm extremely proud to say that is exactly what our team delivered over the course of the fiscal year and then some.
Working together with our distributor and retail partners, we overcame numerous headwinds posed by the pandemic to achieve strong earnings growth and record free cash flow while significantly reducing debt. This strong performance was led by our beer business, which delivered double-digit operating income and organic net sales growth for the fiscal year. Looking forward, we not only have an exciting innovation lineup for the coming year, but we expect our core portfolio to generate robust growth well into the foreseeable future, and therefore, have plans in place to execute our next increment of capacity expansion in Mexico.
Our wine and spirits premiumization strategy gained significant traction during the fiscal year and the divestiture of several lower-end line brands position this business for enhanced growth and profitability going forward.
In addition to the strong performance of our business units, our company also stepped up to help industry partners and communities impacted by COVID and natural disasters and to lend our voice and support in combating social injustice in the U.S. This commitment continues through our additional $1.75 million contribution to the National Restaurant Association's Education Foundation announced earlier this week to support on-premise recovery efforts as well as our recent $10 million contribution to the Clear Vision Fund designed to invest in minority-owned businesses, primarily those operating in underserved black and Latin X communities. And through our most recent efforts to address the disturbing trend of violence against people of Asian descent across the country. In this regard, let me once again extend our deepest sympathies to victims of these deplorable acts and our continued support of members of the Asian community in this difficult time.
Our strong business performance, coupled with learnings from the past year, and planned investments to enable growth, along with our continued commitment to making a positive impact on the world around us, positions Constellation for continued success in fiscal '22 and beyond.
Now let's move to a more detailed discussion of our results and our plans for this year. Fiscal '21 marked the 11th consecutive year of growth for our beer business and reinforced our leadership position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. We drove exceptional performance across our beer portfolio led by our Casa Modelo brand family, including Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Chelada, which remained one of the biggest forces in the U.S. beer industry, delivering more than 13 million cases of growth to the beer category last year.
Modelo Especial achieved yet another year of double-digit growth and now stands as the #3 selling beer in the U.S. in dollar sales with more than 145 million cases sold last year, the only imported beer to ever surpass 10 million barrels in volume. Modelo Negra continues to be the #1 dark beer in the U.S. category, while Modelo Chelada once again achieved double-digit growth and remains the #1 Chelada brand in IRI channels. The Modelo brand family is on fuego, but we're far from done. We have a tremendous amount of momentum with Casa Modelo, and we continue to have huge growth opportunities in front of us. Our core Hispanic drinker remains the foundation of our business, representing more than half of our volume, yet we're still growing volume, penetration and buy rate with them.
We're also making great progress with the non-Hispanic consumer where we've grown penetration by 25% over the last 2 years. And while we continue to grow simple distribution, our effective distribution levels remain below industry leaders. All this represents a massive opportunity to continue our momentum and double-digit growth for this brand family well into the future.
During fiscal '22, we will continue to focus on making Modelo more top of mind with all consumers as we execute more high-profile activations to further engage our drinkers and expand portfolio options to appeal to new consumers and unlock new occasions. These efforts will be supported by a 50% increase in digital, social and e-commerce media. Modelo will once again be an official sponsor of the Gold Cup soccer tournament and will be a major advertiser for the brand throughout the high-profile 2021 Summer Olympic Games.
We'll also be delivering high-profile activations through our biggest sponsorship as the official beer of the UFC. UFC's increasing popularity is allowing us to reach more young, multicultural drinkers than ever. This past year, UFC reached over 41 million viewers on TV, grew their social following by 70% and became the #2 largest sports property on YouTube.
Modelo Chelada has been an extremely successful platform for us as well. And in fiscal '22, we will take our next step on the path to growth by launching our newest flavor, Modelo Chelada Pina Picante. Beyond Cheladas, we also have an opportunity to expand into the rapidly growing consumer trend of betterment by launching Modelo, Cantorito Style Cerveza, a refreshing better-for-you lighter lager made with a hint of real grapefruit, orange and lime juice. With only 100 calories, it delivers lower calorie beer, but with a flavorful and authentic experience as it was inspired by the traditional Canterito cocktail from Jalisco, Mexico. And to top it off, consumers love the idea. This is the highest scoring Modelo new product concept we've ever had. As you can see, Modelo is poised for another great year in fiscal '22.
Moving on to our next powerful brand family. The Corona brand family is thriving and embracing a new year full of possibilities. Our flagship Corona Extra brand remains the #6 U.S. beer brand, growing IRI dollar sales by 11% and surpassing $2 billion in retail sales last year. In fiscal '22, you'll see a refreshed Corona, which will be enabled through a master brand strategy where Corona Equities unite the entire family and each subbrand delivers unique benefits that play to distinct occasions, consumers and motivations while staying true to Corona's DNA.
We have a full year of master brand retail initiatives. on-premise programs ready to go as markets reopen and experiential plans that play to consumers' passion points like music and live sports. For Corona Light, our focus is on general market consumers, particularly females who seek imported taste with fewer calories.
For Familiar, our focus is on uncalculated Hispanics who shop in Hispanic dominant accounts. To ignite our Corona Originals, we will invest in national media spending across digital and social channels as well as national English and Spanish language TV with a significant presence in major live sports properties such as March Madness, the NBA Finals, Gold Cup Soccer and the NFL. The hotline will return to support our sports programs with Kenny Smith and Tony Romo covering the lines.
Last year, Corona's new La Vida Moschino campaign was a smashing success and brought Corona back to the center of cultural conversation with its Snoop and Bad Bunny content generating an impressive 1 billion impressions across TV, digital and social. Snoop and Bad Bunny will be back this year to share their fine life wisdom along with new friends.
This brings us to Corona Premier, Corona's answer to capturing growth in the exploding betterment segment. In fiscal '21, Corona Premier grew depletions volume almost 20% and increased its penetration at a faster rate than its major competitor and other domestic lights, demonstrating we are successfully trading up consumers.
Our golf and active lifestyle platforms for this brand will be supported by a retail program, continued strong media investments in key tournaments and our distinguished sponsorship of the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in June.
Moving on to Refresca, which is Corona's answer for flavor seekers. Because of Refresca's unique flavor experience, it has been incremental to Constellation and the category, bringing in a different consumer from beer and hard seltzer with a Hispanic index of 205 versus the FMB category. So we are happy to be able to bring the Corona Refresca variety pack back in fiscal '22 after a hiatus last year during the pandemic.
We will also build on the initial success of Refresca by extending the brand into the growing high ABV FMB space with the launch of Refresca Mas 24-ounce single-serve cans with 8% ABV and mango citrus flavor.
And this brings us to Constellation's most successful innovation yet, Corona Hard Seltzer. With only 1 SKU, the Corona Hard Seltzer became the #4 brand family in a very short period of time. While consumers have flocked to this category, Corona's iconic image, multicultural consumer base and reputation as the #1 most refreshing beer has allowed Corona Hard Seltzer to recruit new drinkers and expand the segment. In fact, Corona Hard Seltzers year 1 volume delivered approximately 90% incrementality to our portfolio and continues to be the second fastest moving hard seltzer for brands with significant distribution. With no signs of slowing down, the Corona brand family expects ABA to be a significant component in its future growth by expanding its base seltzer proposition and launching incremental innovation. We will continue to focus on growing distribution on Variety Pack #1, while introducing new SKUs to satisfy different taste, occasions and channels.
Our second variety pack is now in market with pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit flavors. we tested a variety of flavors and consumers told us they wanted familiar great-tasting flavors that pair well with a lime from Corona. In keeping with this theme of authenticity, amplified flavor and natural betterment attributes, we're excited to announce Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada, which is launching in June in a 12-pack variety pack and will be line priced with Corona Hard Seltzer. Inspired by traditional Mexican recipes, Limonada will break the mold by delivering authentic flavor, with a splash of real lemon and lime from Mexico juice at only 100 calories.
To support the expansion of all Corona Hard Seltzers, including Limonada, we plan to invest approximately $60 million across all marketing touch points to maintain the #1 share of voice in Seltzers during the critical summer months and will include investment in premium sports properties like March Madness and the NBA.
The plan also includes significant levels of Spanish language support to lean into Corona's strength with Hispanics. Last year, nearly 20% of Corona Hard Seltzers volume came from Hispanics, an index of 1.36 versus the seltzer category.
While we're on the topic, let me address the recent lawsuit filed by one of our competitors an opposition to our use of the Corona trademark for corona heart seltzer. Earlier this week, we filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit as we find these claims to be completely without merit. A Blake attempt to restrain a strong and well-established competitor in a high-growth segment of the U.S. beer market. We have fully complied with the terms of our sublicense agreement, and we will vigorously defend our rights under our sublicense agreement and applicable law. We expect it will take several months for a court ruling on our motion to dismiss. In the meantime, we continue to operate business as usual as we expect our plans in the ABA and hard seltzer space where we fully expect to further build on our momentum for many years to come.
Bottom line, the Corona family growth road map is focused on 3 strategic priorities in fiscal '22. First, we will reignite the core with a refreshed Corona complete with new packaging, best-in-class advertising, leadership levels of media and marketing investment and culturally relevant activations. Number two, We will execute breakthrough innovation, which includes accelerating growth in betterment beer. And third, we will establish a beachhead in the ABA category.
But Let's not forget Pacifico. Let me repeat that. Let's not forget Pacifico, which is the fastest-growing major Mexican import beer brand in the U.S. on a dollar sales basis and is on its way to becoming the next scalable national beer brand in the Constellation portfolio.
We're doing things differently this year with Pacifico with a focus on Gen Z consumers whose attitudes over indexed with Pacifico's independent spirit. Our action sports and cause initiatives resonate strongly with their passions and values. For the first time, we'll have national coverage on major Gen Z relevant digital and social platforms, including Hulu, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Twitch. This will be year 4 of Pacifico being the official beer of the X Games, both summer and winter. 2021 is also an Olympic trials year, and we'll continue our strong partnership with the U.S. ski and snowboard teams with activations and competitions across the U.S. and robust media support on NBC.
I'm also excited to introduce Pacifico's first-ever innovation created for Gen Z consumers with a thirst for new flavors. Pacifico Citrus Agave Lager is Baja inspired and made with a hint of agave, seasalt and lime flavor. We're launching this month in 2 test markets, San Diego and Dallas with 3 SKUs. We look forward to sharing these results and showing how innovation can grow the entire Pacific portfolio.
From an operational perspective, I'm pleased to announce that we recently completed the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which when added to our existing capacity, provides incremental flexibility. As is typical, it will take some months to fully optimize this operation over the coming months.
Because our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer market driven by ongoing robust consumer demand, we are absolutely committed to satisfying this growing consumer demand for our iconic brands, including Corona, Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria. As such, we have developed plans to invest in the next incremental capacity in Mexico that will provide long-term flexibility to equip us with the necessary production to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in mid- to high single-digit range and is expected to continue to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future.
It will also provide incremental flexible capacity that will allow our breweries to operate at sensible utilization rates and deal with unplanned challenges from things like weather-related issues that impacted the business during our recent fiscal year-end. These have been key wins from the pandemic. Our investments will not only support the expected future growth of our core portfolio, but for the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space, and hard seltzers. Meanwhile, in addition to these initiatives, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our long-term plans for production in Mexico.
Together with government officials, we're exploring options that include finding an alternative location in the southeast of Mexico that has adequate water supply and a skilled workforce. Garth will provide additional financial details in just a few minutes.
To sum it up, the U.S. spirit category is healthy and exhibiting strong growth led by the high-end segment. Last year, off-premise channels within the beer category grew 15% with the high-end growing more than 25%. The velocity of our portfolio as well as the growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best in class. We're deliberate about our innovation efforts to ensure they're focused and disciplined, and we're well positioned against where the consumer is going and the future of this industry. We have significant distribution runway for our healthy core portfolio. We will continue to capitalize on the growth of the Hispanic population and the premiumization of the U.S. middle markets. And we are focused on ABA growth, leveraging our core brand equities because we see this as a significant growth opportunity as well.
As a reminder, our fiscal year started March 1, and our first quarter runs through the end of May. As most of you know, last year, this coincided with the beginning of the pandemic when we experienced robust consumer demand for our products that led to record trends in off-premise tracked channels as consumers were in the pantry loading phase of the pandemic.
In addition, during the spring of 2020, we slowed production in Mexico due to COVID, which led to some out of stocks in the U.S. marketplace during summer months. As a result, you should expect to see muted IRI and Nielsen trends early in our fiscal year due to the year-over-year unfavorable overlap until we start to overcome last year's out-of-stock issue when we expect our scanner data to improve significantly. However, recent 4-week IRI trends show that Constellation's beer business is significantly outpacing the total U.S. beer industry and is outperforming the high end of the beer market.
Let's now move on to results of our wine and spirits business. Fiscal '21 was a year of significant progress for our wine and spirits business. The Gallo deal and related divestitures allowed us to sell several lower-end brands. We established category-leading digital capabilities. We optimized our route to market to accelerate performance and built a robust innovation pipeline while driving solid results in the face of a very challenging external environment. In fact, our retained wine and spirits portfolio, excluding divested brands, delivered net sales growth of 5% for the year, driven by double-digit volume growth for Meiomi, Kim Crawford and The Prisoner brand family. These same brands also achieved double-digit distribution gains in off-premise channels last year.
Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth and included Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, which became the #1 high-end new brand in IRI channels in fiscal '21. The wine and spirits business is well positioned to consistently grow net sales low to mid-single digits and produce operating income growth ahead of net sales to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. This will be achieved by the business delivering a margin accretive mix, implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other cost and efficiency improvements.
In the near term, we expect fiscal '22 organic net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. And what gives us confidence in these goals? We have solid plans in place to assure that our wine and spirits transformation focused on premiumization continues to gain traction.
Our high-end brands are well positioned to drive mix and margin expansion, and we plan to continue to take price on select products within select markets throughout the year. We'll leverage the strong equity of these key core brands while building momentum through fully-integrated marketing campaigns and partnerships to drive distinctive and consistent messaging that creates demand for these brands, including Kim, Meiomi, Woodbridge, Ruffino, The Prisoner, High West and SVEDKA. We remain committed to driving mix and margin accretive, scalable innovation by successfully addressing consumer trends, including the convenience, RTD and betterment categories. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year that includes the introduction of Woodbridge Wine Seltzer, the expansion of SVEDKA RTDs after a successful first year launch and new Prisoner family innovation that includes the launch of The Prisoner Pinot Noir, Saldo Red Blend and Unshackled Sauvignon Blanc.
We also plan to benefit in year 2 from this past year's successful innovation launches of Meiomi Cab, Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Chardonnay Cabernet Sauvignon. Our wine and spirits brand continued to outpace the e-commerce category fueled by our outstanding performance in Instacart, Drizly and Amazon and our wine TTC growth continues to outpace the market by close to 2x. In fact, SVEDKA has become the #1 mainstream vodka on Amazon, while Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Meiomi Pinot Noir claimed #1 positions in their respective categories on Drizly, one of the largest online marketplaces for beverage alcohol.
The early investments we made in this space has given us a key first-mover advantage, and we'll continue to invest in DTC and e-commerce initiatives as consumer shifts where and how they purchase beverage alcohol. The evolution of our wine and spirits strategy includes a critical next step to build category-leading dedicated fine wine and craft spirits business, which will strengthen our portfolio and capabilities in this space to meaningfully inflect our business toward the high end. We believe that dedicating the proper focus and attention to our fine wine and craft spirits business will complement our leadership in our mainstream and premium businesses, and will accelerate our goal to drive incremental profitable sales growth.
As we pursue industry-leading growth for our wine and spirits portfolio, we are constantly assessing our route-to-market strategies to ensure we stay ahead of consumer trends and maximize our growth opportunities. Our distributor partners play a significant role in achieving our goals and creating value for the market. 
To that end, we recently announced the evolution of our wine and spirits wholesale structure, whereby Southern Glazer's Wine and spirits assume distribution responsibilities across approximately 70% of our U.S. wine and spirits brand portfolio effective April 1. Southern is a proven brand builder with advanced capabilities in growing consumer segments, including digital commerce, fine wine and craft spirits and ready-to-drink and they have category-leading sales capabilities across on- and off-premise channels. We plan to leverage their strengths in these areas to help accelerate our category leadership. We are confident they are the best partner to help us achieve our strategic ambitions and we believe this move best positions us for long-term success and accelerated growth.
Moving on briefly to Canopy Growth. Over the past year, Canopy has made significant progress in strengthening their position in core markets and taking steps to prepare for the inevitable legalization of cannabis in the U.S. Canopy's successful rollout of cannabis beverages as well as other Rec Point 2.0 products has helped the company gain momentum. Currently, Canopy has the top 3 beverages in the Canadian recreational market, and they recently introduced their popular Quattro CBD beverages in the U.S.
Over the coming year, we look forward to benefiting from Canopy's continued march toward profitability, the rollout of Canopy branded products in the U.S. through Canopy's arrangement with Acreage and the improving legal landscape for cannabis in the U.S.
In closing, Let me reiterate how proud I am of the performance delivered by our Constellation team, along with our distributor and retail partners during a tumultuous year because of their grip passion and determination. We're operating from a position of strength as we head into the new fiscal year, and we're poised to deliver a solid year of performance again in fiscal '22. We will continue to invest aggressively to accelerate growth for our strong portfolio of industry-leading brands. We have exciting innovation in store for the coming year. And we're building capabilities in emerging channels such as 3-tier e-commerce, while adding production capacity to fuel our growth over the long term.
Make no mistake, we have bold ambitions for the future and look forward to delivering on our long-term vision, which includes generating industry-leading returns for our shareholders over that time frame.
And with that, I would like now to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for fiscal '21 and our financial focus for fiscal '22."

Despite a volatile environment and various headwinds experienced throughout the year due to COVID-19, fiscal '21 marked another great year for Constellation Brands, demonstrated by our robust financial results and sol",2736,"Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Despite a volatile environment and various headwinds experienced throughout the year due to COVID-19, fiscal '21 marked another great year for Constellation Brands, demonstrated by our robust financial results and solid business performance.
We produced strong beer operating performance and cash flow results while our wine and spirits consumerization strategy continues to gain momentum and is well positioned to execute growth now that the Gallo transaction is finally closed.
Specifically, In fiscal '21, we achieved strong EPS growth and delivered a comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth of $10.44 . In addition, We generated record operating cash flow and free cash flow of $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, which enabled significant debt reduction of $1.7 billion and reduction of our net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings as we ended the year at 3.1x. And lastly, we returned $575 million of cash to shareholders and dividends.
Now let's review full year fiscal '21 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 8% on shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 10% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 8% and favorable price and mix.
Our full year organic net sales slightly outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments made during the fourth quarter in order to return to normal levels of distributor inventory at fiscal year-end.
Depletion volume growth for the year came in above 7% driven by the continued strength of the Modelo and Corona brand families as throughout the year, strong performance continued in the off-premise channel and more than offset the impact of the 51% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. When adjusting for one less selling day in the year, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 41.1%. Benefits from marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales, pricing, the Ballast Point divestiture and foreign currency more than offset unfavorable operational and logistic costs and mix. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by higher material costs and brewery compensation and benefits, while the increased logistics costs predominantly resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production in fiscal '21. 
While marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 30 points to 9.7% versus prior year, this result landed above our previous guidance in the 9% to 9.5% range driven by incremental strategic investments made during the fourth quarter to provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season.
Moving to wine and spirits. Net sales declined 7% on shipment volume down 16%, while our retained portfolio for the year achieved net sales growth of 5% driven by double-digit volume growth and robust mix benefits for Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner brand family as well as pricing benefits from Woodbridge and SVEDKA.
Full year net sales results outperformed our previous expectations primarily due to stronger mix benefits and some incremental shipments of our retained brands in the fourth quarter. Depletion volume declined approximately 3%, mainly driven by the brands that recently divested, while depletion volume for our retained portfolio declined approximately 1%. The slight decline in our retained portfolio depletion volume was largely driven by strong fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1, 2020 as well as the strategic efforts made throughout the year to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. This resulted in negative impact to depletion trends for the fiscal year, this will allow for better inventory management going forward.
Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 24.5% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS, wine and spirits divestitures and increased marketing and SG&A spend. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of approximately $29 million resulting from decreased production levels as the result of the wildfires.
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in slightly better than our previous guidance finishing at approximately $229 million, up 2% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in insurance-related costs and reduced T&E spend.
Comparable basis interest expense for the year decreased 10% by approximately -- to approximately $386 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Our comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, came in at 18.2% versus 16.1% last year, primarily driven by a lower level of stock-based compensation benefit and higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. Stock-based compensation benefits came in slightly better than expected during Q4. In addition, we realized some small miscellaneous benefits. As a result, this drove tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance.
Moving to Canopy. In fiscal '21, we recognized an $802 million increase in the fair value of our Canopy investments, of which $270 million was recognized in Q4. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $1.1 billion, which increased significantly during the fiscal year, driven by Canopy's robust share price movement.
Now let's briefly review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 16%, primarily due to shipment volume growth of nearly 16%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 18% driven by organic shipment volume growth of approximately 70% and favorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 6%. However, when adjusting for 1 less selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth, which is in line with full year trends and our medium-term growth algorithm.
As you are all aware, inclement weather affected the South predominantly Texas during the last few weeks of February. These abnormal and severe conditions did have a slight impact to our Q4 depletion trends as we're estimating that we lost approximately 50 to 100 basis points of depletion volume growth in the quarter. As previously guided, shipment volume continued to significantly outpace depletion volume during the quarter and as mentioned earlier, this resulted in distributor inventories returning to more normal levels at fiscal year-end.
As expected, beer operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 36.8% as higher marketing spend and increased COGS were partially offset by benefits from favorable SG&A as a percent of net sales, the Ballast Point divestiture and foreign currency. Marketing as a percent of net sales was 12.5% or 380 basis points higher than Q4 last year, driven by the shift of spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year and incremental marketing investments.
Wine and spirits net sales were down 19% for the quarter, while shipment volume was down approximately 33% reflecting the brands divested during the quarter. Our retained portfolio net sales were up 7% driven by strong shipment mix benefits as discussed earlier. Operating margin decreased 900 basis points to 19.9% primarily reflecting the negative impact of the wildfires on COGS, increased marketing and SG&A spend. And wine and spirits divestitures, partially offset by benefits from favorable mix.
Keep in mind that for approximately 2/3 of the quarter, we had a smaller business post the divestitures that was burdened by the full impact of stranded costs on that smaller business. During the quarter, we also recognized a net loss of approximately $46 million in connection with smoke damage sustained during the wildfires, which was excluded from our comparable basis results.
Moving to fiscal '21 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated a record $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash flow. CapEx totaled $865 million and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $700 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, primarily to support the Obregon 5 million hectoliter expansion.
Moving to our full year fiscal '22 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal '22, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.95 to $10.25, which excludes Canopy equity earnings impact. For our beer business in fiscal '22, we are targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin migrating to the low to middle end of our range of 39% to 40%, driven by several cost headwinds we expect to encounter in fiscal '22 due to the following: first, we are estimating a significant step-up in depreciation expense driven by -- primarily by the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon that was recently completed. For fiscal '22, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $260 million or an increase of approximately $65 million.
Second, similar to previous years, We're expecting substantial inflation headwinds in the low to mid-single-digit increase range, largely related to glass and other packaging materials, raw materials, transportation and labor costs in Mexico.
Third, as the growth of hard seltzers and alternative beverage alcohol categories continue to rapidly expand, we expect to continue to experience unfavorable mix impacts as their margins are dilutive from a gross profit perspective due to the incremental packaging costs and flavor additives. Furthermore, we also anticipate a negative mix impact driven by incremental keg volume versus prior year, driven by the continued reopening and return of business to the on-premise channel.
And lastly, we expect margin headwinds related to the brewery expansion costs, which include increased headcount and training expenses. To help partially offset these headwinds, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda and as stated earlier, expect pricing benefits in the 1% to 2% range.
As a result of staggering our fiscal '21 fall price increases throughout the back half of fiscal '21 and in some instances into fiscal '22, we expect to shift more pricing from the fall to the spring in fiscal '22. Lastly, as it relates to beer marketing spend for fiscal '22, We expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range. Keep in mind that marketing spend during the first half of fiscal '21 was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellation and/or postponements. For fiscal '22, we expect to return to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year.
Moving to wine and spirits. For fiscal '22, the wine and spirits business is targeting net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25%, respectively. This implies operating margins to approximate 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. The transformation of our wine and spirits business is underway and over the next few fiscal years, we're committed to removing stranded costs and executing against other cost savings, mix and price and efficiency improvements and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate to operating margins of approximately 30%.
Other fiscal '22 guidance assumptions include: interest expense in the range of $350 million to $360 million, corporate expenses to approximately $235 million, comparable tax rate excluding Canopy equity and earnings of approximately 19%, noncontrolling interest is expected to be approximately $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately $196 million. This assumes no share repurchases for fiscal '22.
We expect fiscal '22 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and CapEx of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions.
I think this is a good spot to elaborate on our capital expansion initiatives for our beer business that Bill touched on earlier. As Bill outlined, our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer industry driven by robust consumer demand. As such, it is essential that we invest appropriately in order to support this growth for our core beer portfolio as well as the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space. These investments include: a 5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava dedicated to ABAs, including hard seltzer that is expected to be completed in early fiscal '23; and we are in the process of expanding Obregon to 19 million hectoliters to be completed by the end of fiscal '25.
As a result, you should expect our annual CapEx spend for the beer business to be in the $700 million to $900 million range to support this 15 million hectoliter capacity expansion during fiscal years '23 to fiscal year '25. These projects are expected to generate solid returns as our beer business has a high operating ROIC and a best-in-class margin profile despite the incremental depreciation expected from our CapEx investments. Even with the capital expenditures associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth allow us to remain focused on operating below our targeted leverage range, which provides us with the flexibility to execute our $5 billion cash return commitment over the next 2 years.
Our brewery operations in Nava and Obregon have long been part of the fabric of these communities. As part of our expansion efforts and commitment to making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, we will continue working with local authorities and community-based organizations on sustainability initiatives that benefit local residents. For instance, over the past several years, Constellation has helped support local infrastructure investments in Obregon that have enhanced water efficiency in the region, more than offsetting our water use at this facility. This is in addition to other benefits we provide, including local job creation and fueling economic development. We are working with local partners in Nava on similar initiatives.
Lastly, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to use or repurpose this site for future use. Therefore, we expect to take an impairment of approximately $650 million to $680 million in Q1 of fiscal '22, which will be excluded from comparable basis results. However, as Bill mentioned, we actively continue to work with government officials in Mexico to pursue various forms of recovery for the costs we have incurred in constructing the brewery and determine next steps in Mexicali. 
In closing, I want to reiterate our expectation to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility as we head into fiscal '22, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders while making strategic investments to support long-term growth initiatives. Fiscal '21 was a challenging year, yet one that provided key learnings resulting from operating in a volatile environment due to the pandemic.
First and foremost, the growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best-in-class, and we expect it to remain as such well into the future. In order to maintain this momentum, we are committed to an exciting innovation agenda, which includes capitalizing on the robust growth in the ABA space, while continuing to support the strong growth momentum of our core beer business. This requires us to expand and optimize our production footprint, which not only sets us up for long-term growth, but provides us with contingent capacity to operate sensible utilization rates while providing us with much needed flexibility. We believe this is the right strategy in order to support our beer business that continues to outperform the market, driven by robust consumer demand, and we are absolutely committed to satisfying these demands.
With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

Relative to Modelo, there's really no end in sight for its double-digit growth profile. It continues to grow with the Hispanic community. And obviously, there's a nice tailwind because of the growth in the Hispanic community. But we still have great distribution opportunities. We continue to grow our velocities on that brand. And when you think about the penetration increasing in the non-Hispanic community, 25% over the last couple of years, we're barely scratching the surface. As you probably know, we really only started to advertise outside the Hispanic community over the last few years. So the upside within that community, we think, is tremendous. And as you also know, we've really never done any innovation in that other than launching the Chelada line, which, of course, has quickly become the #1 Chelada. So the -- we think there's just a tremendous opportunity for Modelo to continue to grow for a long time to come. It's only #3 at this point. There's plenty of room still to go up."

As we entered this year, we said that we were going to have 2 real commitments as it relates to capital allocation. One was paying down debt and then second was making significant progress on that return of capital. Throughout the year, as we noted, we did pay down debt quite a bit. We started the year at about 3.92x and we're ending at about 3.1x. And we paid down -- the Gallo transaction closed in early January. We didn't pay down the last tranche of debt to $5 million redemption in early February. And at that point, we had some things that we were doing that we had to clear up most notably, finalizing our analysis on Mexicali and then the subsequent further investment in capacity. So that's why we didn't make any progress in fiscal '21. But we fully expect to make meaningful progress this year."

I understand the headwinds you guys called out that are going to pressure your beer operating income this year. But I guess, I'm trying to think through some of the levers you might have to offset these pressures. Beer pricing for one comes to mind. As you called out your pricing was softer last year, it was under 1% for the fiscal year, which is below your typical 1% to 2% range. So how should we think about your willingness to take more pricing this fiscal year to offset some of these incremental cost pressures? Would you be willing to go above your typical range?
And then finally, how much visibility do you have with some of the commodity and transportation headwinds that you're facing? Curious, are you fully hedged, for instance, on some of these commodities?"

We believe the 1% to 2% pricing actions that we take pretty much on an annual basis is the smart way to approach it. It balances the opportunity to get improved revenue scenarios with the recognition that you do have some price sensitivity within certain consumer groups that consume our brands. So you always walk that delicate balance of where you go. And our view is 1% to 2% is a good amount that allows us to continue to maintain the strong momentum within our business that we have. As you know, we continue also to aggressively increase our spend overall against our marketing platforms. And that will only be expanded when you think about some of the innovation agenda. So we're very optimistic about the whole platform, but getting much beyond that, I think, in any 1 year is probably not the best way to approach that question. Garth, you might answer her second piece."

So those are possible levers as we move forward. But quite candidly, those cost savings get harder and harder as time goes on. As it relates to our hedging position, as you know, we have a fairly robust and sophisticated hedging policy that allows us to layer in hedges on both commodities and on currencies over the course of many years to take advantage of favorable rates. That -- so we've done that in order to mitigate what otherwise may have been higher inflation this year. That being said, we are not fully hedged in any one thing, whether that's currency or commodities.

We're not going to let this get in the way of focusing on our growth and meeting the growth in high demand that we have for our brands over the long term.

And then just further as it relates to any -- the negotiation of the conversations, I should say that Bill referenced, we do expect that there will be some additional recovery and that recovery could come in many different forms. It could come in cash payments. It could come in tax credits. It could come into infrastructure credits, things of that nature. So we're certainly not done as it relates to trying to recover any lost cost."

It's not unexpected in a category that's continuing to bring in new consumers that you have some seasonality effect. We certainly saw a greater seasonality effect over this recent period than we saw a year ago, as an example. Our view is that's likely because you have a significant higher percentage of either early or less consistent users. So it wasn't really a surprise. It still remains a growth sector within the beer industry. 
Our forecast is that it's going to continue to grow, and it's continued to be a very important part, which is why we're more than doubling our capabilities against hard seltzer for this particular year coming that we're just starting. We believe this is going to be an important part, and it also provides an interesting entree for people into the overall beer category.
Relative to the market share. As you know, as we expanded our capabilities, that allowed us to do additional SKUs. We did almost 10 million cases this past year with 1 SKU, which is kind of an outstanding launch, if you will. But the expansion that we are putting in place is going to allow us to more than double that. We've already introduced SKU #2 and #2 Variety Pack, and we have Limonada coming online here this coming June. So our expectation is you'll see a significant increase in our share proposition in part because we'll have more available to the consumer, and we'll have more shelf space on the warm shelf and more cold box space in the cold box as well. So we're very optimistic about what our profile will look like as the year goes on."

So we certainly would expect some of that. I think the open question it's very difficult to predict, quite frankly, is where the whole channel mix ends up going. It's an open question. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise channel than some of our competitors because our overall profile skews more to the off-premise anyway.

The core business in Southern California continues to do extremely well, and it's developing across the country. Again, we're really just scratching the surface of building out what this brand could be. But my old friend, Bill Hackett always said, Pacifico is starting to look a lot like Modelo look, about 15 to 20 years ago in terms of the development and how it really started out in the California base. As you know, Modelo is now the #1 brand in the state of California. I'm not making a prediction that Pacifico will be the #1 brand, but it wouldn't be the worst thing that ever happened. So certainly, there's just a lot to be excited about. You then add in that we're starting to do some innovation and some innovation testing in that brand with Gen Z consumers. This brand very much overindexes with Gen Z consumers. So we're bringing in a somewhat different audience than what we have with some of our other franchises. So again, it's early days, but there's just so much to be excited about with Pacifico. We really think this could easily be the next big franchise within our overall portfolio.

I mean, look, look, in the construct of everything we're trying to do from a capital allocation standpoint is we want to make sure that we maintain investment grade. We want to make sure that we returned to shareholders what we previously said we would return to shareholders, which was about $2.5 billion of share buybacks and $2.5 billion of dividends. And we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in our business as we talked about investing significantly in Mexico to support the robust growth of our portfolio. So all of that goes into the mix when we're trying to decide where to spend the money. And so -- and as it relates specifically to dividends versus share buybacks, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our payout ratio, right in the target of what we've set for ourselves. So that's why we didn't increase it more. And by keeping it where we are, we're able to do all those other things that I said, return a significant amount of money in share repurchases, invest behind the brands, maintain our investment-grade rating."

Relative to on-premise, remember, today, it's only 6% of our business as it currently stands because of the significant decrease that's occurred based on COVID. So our expectation is we're still going to see very robust growth in the off-premise during this fiscal year. And as you've seen, we're consistent with our long-term growth algorithm that we've seen. Already stated, March is off to an excellent start. So we're very optimistic about that algorithm. But with that said, we -- it's also going to be difficult to exactly predict what will happen with the on-premise because we've already seen as markets have opened and then closed a little bit and reopened. There's just a lot of variability that's hard to predict. Again, while there is an overexpression in the off-premise, that isn't the worst thing for us.

One of the things that we've been quite good at over the last several years is running our plants at hyper efficiency. But I think one thing is learning from the pandemic, and I think if any good business should have an element of learning when something hits you in the face. And the pandemic certainly did that across many, many, many industries. One of the things we learned is while our efficiency was tremendous, we didn't have a lot of flexibility in the event that something didn't go well. And so one of the pieces that we are doing with this expansion is not only to meet the hyper growth that we have within our business, but also to create some increasing flexibility and some redundancy within our business. So then if you have weather challenges or COVID, we had another pandemic, but if you had weather challenges or some other curveballs that occurred, it would have minimal to no impact on our ongoing supply. So that was very important.
Relative to the Southeast, we are considering that. It's critically important to have water supply. There's actually a lot of shipping capabilities from some of the areas that we are looking into. So we're pretty confident that, that could very well be a future location for a brewery for us. Admittedly, that's a bit out. It takes 2 to 4 years to even get that process going and underway.

Before then, we hope you'll choose some of our fine products for your spring celebrations, including Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day and let us all hope they are a bit more normal. Thanks again, and have a great day."

And for many, it's been one of the most challenging years in recent memory. 
At this time last year, we outlined our philosophy for managing the business and navigating through this period of uncertainty. We committed to making decisions that prioritize the physical and economic safety, health and well-being of our employees. We committed to remaining consumer-obsessed, relentlessly focused on doing all we can to meet consumer needs. We pledged to continue managing our business with discipline, ensuring appropriate balance between short-term needs and positioning Constellation for sustainable long-term success. And we pledged to continue making decisions aligned with our long-term strategic vision. This is what best-of-class companies do in periods of uncertainty, and I'm extremely proud to say that is exactly what our team delivered over the course of the fiscal year and then some. 
Working together with our distributor and retail partners, we overcame numerous headwinds posed by the pandemic to achieve strong earnings growth and record free cash flow while significantly reducing debt. This strong performance was led by our beer business, which delivered double-digit operating income and organic net sales growth for the fiscal year. Looking forward, we not only have an exciting innovation lineup for the coming year, but we expect our core portfolio to generate robust growth well into the foreseeable future, and therefore, have plans in place to execute our next increment of capacity expansion in Mexico. 
Our wine and spirits premiumization strategy gained significant traction during the fiscal year and the divestiture of several lower-end wine brands position this business for enhanced growth and profitability going forward. 
In addition to the strong performance of our business units, our company also stepped up to help industry partners and communities impacted by COVID and natural disasters and to lend our voice and support in combating social injustice in the U.S. This commitment continues through our additional $1.75 million contribution to the National Restaurant Association's Education Foundation announced earlier this week to support on-premise recovery efforts as well as our recent $10 million contribution to the Clear Vision Fund designed to invest in minority-owned businesses, primarily those operating in underserved black and Latin X communities. And through our most recent efforts to address the disturbing trend of violence against people of Asian descent across the country. In this regard, let me once again extend our deepest sympathies to victims of these deplorable acts and our continued support of members of the Asian community in this difficult time. 
Our strong business performance, coupled with learnings from the past year and planned investments to enable growth, along with our continued commitment to making a positive impact on the world around us, positions Constellation for continued success in fiscal '22 and beyond. 
Now let's move to a more detailed discussion of our results and our plans for this year. Fiscal '21 marked the 11th consecutive year of growth for our beer business and reinforced our leadership position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. We drove exceptional performance across our beer portfolio led by our Casa Modelo brand family, including Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Chelada, which remained one of the biggest forces in the U.S. beer industry, delivering more than 13 million cases of growth to the beer category last year. 
Modelo Especial achieved yet another year of double-digit growth and now stands as the #3 selling beer in the U.S. in dollar sales with more than 145 million cases sold last year, the only imported beer to ever surpass 10 million barrels in volume. 
Modelo Negra continues to be the #1 dark beer in the U.S. category, while Modelo Chelada once again achieved double-digit growth and remains the #1 Chelada brand in IRI channels. 
The Modelo brand family is en fuego, but we're far from done. We have a tremendous amount of momentum with Casa Modelo, and we continue to have huge growth opportunities in front of us. Our core Hispanic drinker remains the foundation of our business, representing more than half of our volume, yet we're still growing volume, penetration and buy rate with them. 
We're also making great progress with the non-Hispanic consumer where we've grown penetration by 25% over the last 2 years. 
And while we continue to grow simple distribution, our effective distribution levels remain below industry leaders. All this represents a massive opportunity to continue our momentum and double-digit growth for this brand family well into the future. 
During fiscal '22, we will continue to focus on making Modelo more top of mind with all consumers as we execute more high-profile activations to further engage our drinkers and expand portfolio options to appeal to new consumers and unlock new occasions. These efforts will be supported by a 50% increase in digital, social and e-commerce media. Modelo will once again be an official sponsor of the Gold Cup soccer tournament and will be a major advertiser for the brand throughout the high-profile 2021 Summer Olympic Games. 
We'll also be delivering high-profile activations through our biggest sponsorship as the official beer of the UFC. UFC's increasing popularity is allowing us to reach more young, multicultural drinkers than ever. This past year, UFC reached over 41 million viewers on TV, grew their social following by 70% and became the #2 largest sports property on YouTube. 
Modelo Chelada has been an extremely successful platform for us as well. And in fiscal '22, we will take our next step on the path to growth by launching our newest flavor,  Modelo Chelada Pina Picante. Beyond Cheladas, we also have an opportunity to expand into the rapidly growing consumer trend of betterment by launching Modelo Cantarito style cerveza, a refreshing better-for-you lighter lager made with a hint of real grapefruit, orange and lime juice. With only 100 calories, it delivers lower calorie beer, but with a flavorful and authentic experience as it was inspired by the traditional Cantarito cocktail from Jalisco, Mexico. And to top it off, consumers love the idea. This is the highest scoring Modelo new product concept we've ever had. As you can see, Modelo is poised for another great year in fiscal '22. 
Moving on to our next powerful brand family. The Corona brand family is thriving and embracing a new year full of possibilities. Our flagship Corona Extra brand remains the #6 U.S. beer brand, growing IRI dollar sales by 11% and surpassing $2 billion in retail sales last year. In fiscal '22, you'll see a refreshed Corona, which will be enabled through a master brand strategy where Corona equities unite the entire family and each subbrand delivers unique benefits that play to distinct occasions, consumers and motivations while staying true to Corona's DNA. 
We have a full year of master brand retail initiatives. on-premise programs ready to go as markets reopen and experiential plans that play to consumers' passion points like music and live sports. For Corona Light, our focus is on general market consumers, particularly females, who seek imported taste with fewer calories. 
For Familiar, our focus is on unacculturated Hispanics who shop in Hispanic dominant accounts. To ignite our Corona originals, we will invest in national media spending across digital and social channels as well as national English and Spanish language TV, with a significant presence in major live sports properties such as March Madness, the NBA Finals, Gold Cup Soccer and the NFL. The hotline will return to support our sports programs with Kenny Smith and Tony Romo covering the lines. 
Last year, Corona's new La Vida Más Fina campaign was a smashing success and brought Corona back to the center of cultural conversation with its Snoop and Bad Bunny content generating an impressive 1 billion impressions across TV, digital and social. Snoop and Bad Bunny will be back this year to share their fine life wisdom along with new friends. 
This brings us to Corona Premier, Corona's answer to capturing growth in the exploding betterment segment. In fiscal '21, Corona Premier grew depletions volume almost 20% and increased its penetration at a faster rate than its major competitor and other domestic lights, demonstrating we are successfully trading up consumers. 
Our golf and active lifestyle platforms for this brand will be supported by a retail program, continued strong media investments in key tournaments and our distinguished sponsorship of the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in June. 
Moving on to Refresca, which is Corona's answer for flavor seekers. Because of Refresca's unique flavor experience, it has been incremental to Constellation and the category, bringing in a different consumer from beer and hard seltzer with a Hispanic index of 205 versus the FMB category. So we are happy to be able to bring the Corona Refresca variety pack back in fiscal '22 after a hiatus last year during the pandemic. 
We will also build on the initial success of Refresca by extending the brand into the growing high ABV FMB space with the launch of Refresca Mas 24-ounce single-serve cans with 8% ABV and mango citrus flavor. 
And this brings us to Constellation's most successful innovation yet, Corona Hard Seltzer. With only 1 SKU, the Corona Hard Seltzer became the #4 brand family in a very short period of time. While consumers have flocked to this category, Corona's iconic image, multicultural consumer base and reputation as the #1 most refreshing beer has allowed Corona Hard Seltzer to recruit new drinkers and expand the segment. In fact, Corona Hard Seltzer's year 1 volume delivered approximately 90% incrementality to our portfolio and continues to be the second fastest moving hard seltzer for brands with significant distribution. With no signs of slowing down, the Corona brand family expects ABAs to be a significant component in its future growth by expanding its base seltzer proposition and launching incremental innovation. We will continue to focus on growing distribution on variety pack #1, while introducing new SKUs to satisfy different tastes, occasions and channels. 
Our second variety pack is now in market with pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit flavors. We tested a variety of flavors, and consumers told us they wanted familiar, great-tasting flavors that pair well with a lime from Corona. In keeping with this theme of authenticity, amplified flavor and natural betterment attributes, we're excited to announce Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada, which is launching in June in a 12-pack variety pack and will be line-priced with Corona Hard Seltzer. Inspired by traditional Mexican recipes, Limonada will break the mold by delivering authentic   flavor, with a splash of real lemon and lime from Mexico juice at only 100 calories. 
To support the expansion of all Corona Hard Seltzers, including Limonada, we plan to invest approximately $60 million across all marketing touch points to maintain the #1 share of voice in Seltzers during the critical summer months and will include investment in premium sports properties like March Madness and the NBA.  The plan also includes significant levels of Spanish language support to lean into Corona's strength with Hispanics. Last year, nearly 20% of Corona Hard Seltzers volume came from Hispanics, an index of 1.36 versus the seltzer category. 
While we're on the topic, let me address the recent lawsuit filed by one of our competitors, an opposition to our use of the Corona trademark for Corona Hard Seltzer. Earlier this week, we filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit as we find these claims to be completely without merit, a blatant attempt to restrain a strong and well-established competitor in a high-growth segment of the U.S. beer market. We have fully complied with the terms of our sublicense agreement, and we will vigorously defend our rights under our sublicense agreement and applicable law. We expect it will take several months for a court ruling on our motion to dismiss. In the meantime, we continue to operate business as usual as we expect our plans in the ABA and hard seltzer space where we fully expect to further build on our momentum for many years to come. 
Bottom line, the Corona family growth road map is focused on 3 strategic priorities in fiscal '22:  First, we will reignite the core with a refreshed Corona complete with new packaging, best-in-class advertising, leadership levels of media and marketing investment and culturally relevant activations.  Number two, We will execute breakthrough innovation, which includes accelerating growth in betterment beer.  And third, we will establish a beachhead in the ABA category. 
But let's not forget Pacifico. Let me repeat that. Let's not forget Pacifico, which is the fastest-growing major Mexican import beer brand in the U.S. on a dollar sales basis and is on its way to becoming the next scalable national beer brand in the Constellation portfolio. 
We're doing things differently this year with Pacifico with a focus on Gen Z consumers whose attitudes over-index with Pacifico's independent spirit. Our action sports and cause initiatives resonate strongly with their passions and values. For the first time, we'll have national coverage on major Gen Z relevant digital and social platforms, including Hulu, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Twitch. This will be year 4 of Pacifico being the official beer of the X Games, both summer and winter. 2021 is also an Olympic trials year, and we'll continue our strong partnership with the U.S. ski and snowboard teams with activations at competitions across the U.S. and robust media support on NBC. 
I'm also excited to introduce Pacifico's first-ever innovation created for Gen Z consumers with a thirst for new flavors. Pacifico Citrus Agave Lager is Baja-inspired and made with a hint of agave, sea salt and lime flavor. We're launching this month in 2 test markets, San Diego and Dallas, with 3 SKUs. We look forward to sharing these results and showing how innovation can grow the entire Pacifico portfolio. 
From an operational perspective, I'm pleased to announce that we've recently completed the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which when added to our existing capacity, provides incremental flexibility. As is typical, it will take some months to fully optimize this operation over the coming months. 
Because our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer market driven by ongoing robust consumer demand, we are absolutely committed to satisfying this growing consumer demand for our iconic brands, including Corona, Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria. As such, we have developed plans to invest in the next incremental capacity in Mexico that will provide long-term flexibility to equip us with the necessary production to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in mid- to high single-digit range and is expected to continue to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. 
It will also provide incremental flexible capacity that will allow our breweries to operate at sensible utilization rates and deal with unplanned challenges from things like weather-related issues that impacted the business during our recent fiscal year-end. These have been key wins from the pandemic. Our investments will not only support the expected future growth of our core portfolio, but for the emerging ABA, or alternative beverage alcohol space and hard seltzers. 
Meanwhile, in addition to these initiatives, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our long-term plans for production in Mexico. 
Together with government officials, we're exploring options that include finding an alternative location in the southeast of Mexico that has adequate water supply and a skilled workforce. Garth will provide additional financial details in just a few minutes. 
To sum it up, the U.S. beer category is healthy and exhibiting strong growth led by the high-end segment. Last year, off-premise channels within the beer category grew 15%, with the high-end growing more than 25%. The velocity of our portfolio as well as the growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best in class. We're deliberate about our innovation efforts to ensure they're focused and disciplined, and we're well positioned against where the consumer is going and the future of this industry. We have significant distribution runway for our healthy core portfolio. We will continue to capitalize on the growth of the Hispanic population and the premiumization of the U.S. middle markets. And we are focused on ABA growth, leveraging our core brand equities because we see this as a significant growth opportunity as well. 
As a reminder, our fiscal year started March 1, and our first quarter runs through the end of May. As most of you know, last year, this coincided with the beginning of the pandemic when we experienced robust consumer demand for our products that led to record trends in off-premise tracked channels as consumers were in the pantry loading phase of the pandemic. 
In addition, during the spring of 2020, we slowed production in Mexico due to COVID, which led to some out of stocks in the U.S. marketplace during summer months. As a result, you should expect to see muted IRI and Nielsen trends early in our fiscal year due to the year-over-year unfavorable overlap until we start to overcome last year's out-of-stock issue when we expect our scanner data to improve significantly. However, recent 4-week IRI trends show that Constellation's beer business is significantly outpacing the total U.S. beer industry and is outperforming the high end of the beer market. 
Let's now move on to results of our wine and spirits business. Fiscal '21 was a year of significant progress for our wine and spirits business. The Gallo deal and related divestitures allowed us to sell several lower-end brands. We established category-leading digital capabilities. We optimized our route to market to accelerate performance, and built a robust innovation pipeline while driving solid results in the face of a very challenging external environment. In fact, our retained wine and spirits portfolio, excluding divested brands, delivered net sales growth of 5% for the year, driven by double-digit volume growth for Meiomi, Kim Crawford and The Prisoner brand family. These same brands also achieved double-digit distribution gains in off-premise channels last year. 
Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth and included Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, which became the #1 high-end new brand in IRI channels in fiscal '21.  The wine and spirits business is well positioned to consistently grow net sales low to mid-single digits and produce operating income growth ahead of net sales to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. This will be achieved by the business delivering a margin-accretive mix, implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other cost and efficiency improvements. 
In the near term, we expect fiscal '22 organic net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. And what gives us confidence in these goals? We have solid plans in place to assure that our wine and spirits transformation, focused on premiumization, continues to gain traction. 
Our high-end brands are well positioned to drive mix and margin expansion, and we plan to continue to take price on select products within select markets throughout the year. We'll leverage the strong equity of these key core brands while building momentum through fully-integrated marketing campaigns and partnerships to drive distinctive and consistent messaging that creates demand for these brands, including Kim, Meiomi, Woodbridge, Ruffino, The Prisoner, High West and SVEDKA. 
We remain committed to driving mix and margin-accretive, scalable innovation by successfully addressing consumer trends, including the convenience, RTD and betterment categories. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year that includes the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzer, the expansion of SVEDKA RTDs after a successful first year launch and new Prisoner family innovation that includes the launch of The Prisoner Pinot Noir, Saldo Red Blend and Unshackled Sauvignon Blanc. 
We also plan to benefit in year 2 from this past year's successful innovation launches of Meiomi Cab, Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. Our wine and spirits brand continued to outpace the e-commerce category, fueled by our outstanding performance in Instacart, Drizly and Amazon. And our wine DTC growth continues to outpace the market by close to 2x. In fact, SVEDKA has become the #1 mainstream vodka on Amazon, while Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Meiomi Pinot Noir claimed #1 positions in their respective categories on Drizly, one of the largest online marketplaces for beverage alcohol. 
The early investments we made in this space has given us a key first-mover advantage, and we'll continue to invest in DTC and e-commerce initiatives as consumer shifts where and how they purchase beverage alcohol. The evolution of our wine and spirits strategy includes a critical next step to build category-leading dedicated fine wine and craft spirits business, which will strengthen our portfolio and capabilities in this space to meaningfully inflect our business toward the high end. We believe that dedicating the proper focus and attention to our fine wine and craft spirits business will complement our leadership in our mainstream and premium businesses, and will accelerate our goal to drive incremental profitable sales growth. 
As we pursue industry-leading growth for our wine and spirits portfolio, we are constantly assessing our route-to-market strategies to ensure we stay ahead of consumer trends and maximize our growth opportunities. Our distributor partners play a significant role in achieving our goals and creating value for the market.  
To that end, we recently announced the evolution of our wine and spirits wholesale structure, whereby Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits assume distribution responsibilities across approximately 70% of our U.S. wine and spirits brand portfolio effective April 1. Southern is a proven brand builder with advanced capabilities in growing consumer segments, including digital commerce, fine wine and craft spirits and ready-to-drink. And they have category-leading sales capabilities across on- and off-premise channels. We plan to leverage their strengths in these areas to help accelerate our category leadership. We are confident they are the best partner to help us achieve our strategic ambitions and we believe this move best positions us for long-term success and accelerated growth. 
Moving on briefly to Canopy Growth. Over the past year, Canopy has made significant progress in strengthening their position in core markets and taking steps to prepare for the inevitable legalization of cannabis in the U.S. Canopy's successful rollout of cannabis beverages as well as other Rec 2.0 products has helped the company gain momentum. Currently, Canopy has the top 3 beverages in the Canadian recreational market, and they recently introduced their popular Quatreau CBD beverages in the U.S. 
Over the coming year, we look forward to benefiting from Canopy's continued march toward profitability, the rollout of Canopy-branded products in the U.S. through Canopy's arrangement with Acreage and the improving legal landscape for cannabis in the U.S.
In closing, let me reiterate how proud I am of the performance delivered by our Constellation team, along with our distributor and retail partners during a tumultuous year because of their grit passion and determination. We're operating from a position of strength as we head into the new fiscal year, and we're poised to deliver a solid year of performance again in fiscal '22. We will continue to invest aggressively to accelerate growth for our strong portfolio of industry-leading brands. We have exciting innovation in store for the coming year. And we're building capabilities in emerging channels such as 3-tier e-commerce, while adding production capacity to fuel our growth over the long term.
Make no mistake, we have bold ambitions for the future and look forward to delivering on our long-term vision, which includes generating industry-leading returns for our shareholders over that time frame.
And with that, I would like now to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for fiscal '21 and our financial focus for fiscal '22."

Despite a volatile environment and various headwinds experienced throughout the year due to COVID-19, fiscal '21 marked another great year for Constellation Brands, demonstrated by our robust financial results and solid business performance.
We produced strong beer operating performance and cash flow results while our wine and spirits consumerization strategy continues to gain momentum and is well positioned to execute growth now that the Gallo transaction is finally closed.
Specifically, in fiscal '21, we achieved strong EPS growth and delivered a comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth of $10.44. In addition, We generated record operating cash flow and free cash flow of $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, which enabled significant debt reduction of $1.7 billion and reduction of our net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings as we ended the year at 3.1x. And lastly, we returned $575 million of cash to shareholders in dividends.
Now let's review full year fiscal '21 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. 
Starting with beer. Net sales increased 8% on shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 10% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 8% and favorable price and mix.
Our full year organic net sales slightly outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments made during the fourth quarter in order to return to normal levels of distributor inventory at fiscal year-end.
Depletion volume growth for the year came in above 7% driven by the continued strength of the Modelo and Corona brand families as throughout the year, strong performance continued in the off-premise channel and more than offset the impact of the 51% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. When adjusting for one less selling day in the year, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 41.1%. Benefits from marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales, pricing, the Ballast Point divestiture and foreign currency more than offset unfavorable operational and logistic costs and mix. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by higher material costs and brewery compensation and benefits, while the increased logistics costs predominantly resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production in fiscal '21. 
While marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 30 points to 9.7% versus prior year, this result landed above our previous guidance in the 9% to 9.5% range driven by incremental strategic investments made during the fourth quarter to provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season.
Moving to wine and spirits. Net sales declined 7% on shipment volume down 16%, while our retained portfolio for the year achieved net sales growth of 5% driven by double-digit volume growth and robust mix benefits for Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner brand family as well as pricing benefits from Woodbridge and SVEDKA.
Full year net sales results outperformed our previous expectations primarily due to stronger mix benefits and some incremental shipments of our retained brands in the fourth quarter. Depletion volume declined approximately 3%, mainly driven by the brands that recently divested, while depletion volume for our retained portfolio declined approximately 1%. The slight decline in our retained portfolio depletion volume was largely driven by strong fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1, 2020 as well as the strategic efforts made throughout the year to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. While this resulted in negative impact to depletion trends for the fiscal year, this will allow for better inventory management going forward.
Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 24.5% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS, wine and spirits divestitures and increased marketing and SG&A spend. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of approximately $29 million resulting from decreased production levels as the result of the wildfires.
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in slightly better than our previous guidance finishing at approximately $229 million, up 2% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in insurance-related costs and reduced T&E spend.
Comparable basis interest expense for the year decreased 10% by approximately -- to approximately $386 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Our comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, came in at 18.2% versus 16.1% last year, primarily driven by a lower level of stock-based compensation benefit and higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. Stock-based compensation benefits came in slightly better than expected during Q4. In addition, we realized some small miscellaneous benefits. As a result, this drove tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance.
Moving to Canopy. In fiscal '21, we recognized an $802 million increase in the fair value of our Canopy investments, of which $270 million was recognized in Q4. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $1.1 billion, which increased significantly during the fiscal year, driven by Canopy's robust share price movement.
Now let's briefly review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 16%, primarily due to shipment volume growth of nearly 16%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 18% driven by organic shipment volume growth of approximately 70% and favorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 6%. However, when adjusting for 1 less selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth, which is in line with full year trends and our medium-term growth algorithm.
As you are all aware, inclement weather affected the South, predominantly Texas, during the last few weeks of February. These abnormal and severe conditions did have a slight impact to our Q4 depletion trends as we're estimating that we lost approximately 50 to 100 basis points of depletion volume growth in the quarter. As previously guided, shipment volume continued to significantly outpace depletion volume during the quarter, and as mentioned earlier, this resulted in distributor inventories returning to more normal levels at fiscal year-end.
As expected, beer operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 36.8% as higher marketing spend and increased COGS were partially offset by benefits from favorable SG&A as a percent of net sales, the Ballast Point divestiture and foreign currency. Marketing as a percent of net sales was 12.5% or 380 basis points higher than Q4 last year, driven by the shift of spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year and incremental marketing investments.
Wine and spirits net sales were down 19% for the quarter, while shipment volume was down approximately 33%, reflecting the brands divested during the quarter. Our retained portfolio net sales were up 7% driven by strong shipment mix benefits as discussed earlier. Operating margin decreased 900 basis points to 19.9% primarily reflecting the negative impact of the wildfires on COGS, increased marketing and SG&A spend, and wine and spirits divestitures, partially offset by benefits from favorable mix.
Keep in mind that for approximately 2/3 of the quarter, we had a smaller business post the divestitures that was burdened by the full impact of stranded costs on that smaller business. During the quarter, we also recognized a net loss of approximately $46 million in connection with smoke damage sustained during the wildfires, which was excluded from our comparable basis results.
Moving to fiscal '21 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated a record $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash flow. CapEx totaled $865 million and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $700 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, primarily to support the Obregon 5 million hectoliter expansion.
Moving to our full year fiscal '22 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal '22, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.95 to $10.25, which excludes Canopy equity earnings impact. For our beer business in fiscal '22, we are targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin migrating to the low to middle end of our range of 39% to 40%, driven by several cost headwinds we expect to encounter in fiscal '22 due to the following: first, we are estimating a significant step-up in depreciation expense driven by -- primarily by the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon that was recently completed. For fiscal '22, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $260 million or an increase of approximately $65 million.
Second, similar to previous years, We're expecting substantial inflation headwinds in the low to mid-single-digit increase range, largely related to glass and other packaging materials, raw materials, transportation and labor costs in Mexico.
Third, as the growth of hard seltzers and alternative beverage alcohol categories continue to rapidly expand, we expect to continue to experience unfavorable mix impacts as their margins are dilutive from a gross profit perspective due to the incremental packaging costs and flavor additives. Furthermore, we also anticipate a negative mix impact driven by incremental keg volume versus prior year, driven by the continued reopening and return of business to the on-premise channel.
And lastly, we expect margin headwinds related to the brewery expansion costs, which include increased headcount and training expenses. 
To help partially offset these headwinds, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda. And as stated earlier, expect pricing benefits in the 1% to 2% range.
As a result of staggering our fiscal '21 fall price increases throughout the back half of fiscal '21, and in some instances, into fiscal '22, we expect to shift more pricing from the fall to the spring in fiscal '22. 
Lastly, as it relates to beer marketing spend for fiscal '22, We expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range. Keep in mind that marketing spend during the first half of fiscal '21 was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellation and/or postponements. For fiscal '22, we expect to return to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year.
Moving to wine and spirits. For fiscal '22, the wine and spirits business is targeting net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25%, respectively. This implies operating margins to approximate 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. The transformation of our wine and spirits business is underway, and over the next few fiscal years, we're committed to removing stranded costs and executing against other cost savings, mix and price and efficiency improvements. And we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate to operating margins of approximately 30%.
Other fiscal '22 guidance assumptions include: interest expense in the range of $350 million to $360 million, corporate expenses to approximately $235 million, comparable tax rate excluding Canopy equity and earnings, of approximately 19%. Noncontrolling interest is expected to be approximately $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately 196 million. This assumes no share repurchases for fiscal '22.
We expect fiscal '22 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and CapEx of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions.
I think this is a good spot to elaborate on our capital expansion initiatives for our beer business that Bill touched on earlier. As Bill outlined, our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer industry, driven by robust consumer demand. As such, it is essential that we invest appropriately in order to support this growth for our core beer portfolio as well as the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space. These investments include a 5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava dedicated to ABAs, including hard seltzer that is expected to be completed in early fiscal '23, and we are in the process of expanding Obregon to 19 million hectoliters to be completed by the end of fiscal '25.
As a result, you should expect our annual CapEx spend for the beer business to be in the $700 million to $900 million range to support this 15 million hectoliter capacity expansion during fiscal years '23 to fiscal year '25. These projects are expected to generate solid returns as our beer business has a high operating ROIC and a best-in-class margin profile despite the incremental depreciation expected from our CapEx investments. Even with the capital expenditures associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth allow us to remain focused on operating below our targeted leverage range, which provides us with the flexibility to execute our $5 billion cash return commitment over the next 2 years.
Our brewery operations in Nava and Obregon have long been part of the fabric of these communities. As part of our expansion efforts and commitment to making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, we will continue working with local authorities and community-based organizations on sustainability initiatives that benefit local residents. For instance, over the past several years, Constellation has helped support local infrastructure investments in Obregon that have enhanced water efficiency in the region, more than offsetting our water use at this facility. This is in addition to other benefits we provide, including local job creation and fueling economic development. We are working with local partners in Nava on similar initiatives.
Lastly, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to use or repurpose this site for future use. Therefore, we expect to take an impairment of approximately $650 million to $680 million in Q1 of fiscal '22, which will be excluded from comparable basis results. However, as Bill mentioned, we actively continue to work with government officials in Mexico to pursue various forms of recovery for the costs we have incurred in constructing the brewery and determine next steps in Mexicali. 
In closing, I want to reiterate our expectation to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility as we head into fiscal '22, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders while making strategic investments to support long-term growth initiatives. 
Fiscal '21 was a challenging year, yet one that provided key learnings resulting from operating in a volatile environment due to the pandemic.  First and foremost, the growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best-in-class, and we expect it to remain as such well into the future. In order to maintain this momentum, we are committed to an exciting innovation agenda, which includes capitalizing on the robust growth in the ABA space, while continuing to support the strong growth momentum of our core beer business. This requires us to expand and optimize our production footprint, which not only sets us up for long-term growth, but provides us with contingent capacity to operate at sensible utilization rates while providing us with much needed flexibility. We believe this is the right strategy in order to support our beer business that continues to outperform the market, driven by robust consumer demand, and we are absolutely committed to satisfying these demands.
With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

Relative to Modelo, there's really no end in sight for its double-digit growth profile. It continues to grow with the Hispanic community. And obviously, there's a nice tailwind because of the growth in the Hispanic community. But we still have great distribution opportunities. We continue to grow our velocities on that brand. And when you think about the penetration increasing in the non-Hispanic community, 25% over the last couple of years, we're barely scratching the surface. 
As you probably know, we really only started to advertise outside the Hispanic community over the last few years. So the upside within that community, we think, is tremendous. And as you also know, we've really never done any innovation in that other than launching the Chelada line, which, of course, has quickly become the #1 Chelada. 
So the -- we think there's just a tremendous opportunity for Modelo to continue to grow for a long time to come. It's only #3 at this point. There's plenty of room still to go up."

As we entered this year, we said that we were going to have 2 real commitments as it relates to capital allocation. One was paying down debt and then second was making significant progress on that return of capital. Throughout the year, as we noted, we did pay down debt quite a bit. We started the year at about 3.92x and we're ending at about 3.1x. And we paid down -- the Gallo transaction closed in early January. We didn't pay down the last tranche of debt to $5 million redemption in early February. And at that point, we had some things that we were doing that we had to clear up, most notably, finalizing our analysis on Mexicali and then the subsequent further investment in capacity. So that's why we didn't make any progress in fiscal '21. But we fully expect to make meaningful progress this year."

I understand the headwinds you guys called out that are going to pressure your beer operating income this year. But I guess, I'm trying to think through some of the levers you might have to offset these pressures. Beer pricing for one comes to mind. As you called out your pricing was softer last year, it was under 1% for the fiscal year, which is below your typical 1% to 2% range. So how should we think about your willingness to take more pricing this fiscal year to offset some of these incremental cost pressures? Would you be willing to go above your typical range?
And then finally, how much visibility do you have with some of the commodity and transportation headwinds that you're facing? Curious, are you fully hedged, for instance, on some of these commodities?"

We believe the 1% to 2% pricing actions that we take pretty much on an annual basis is the smart way to approach it.

So you always walk that delicate balance of where you go. And our view is 1% to 2% is a good amount that allows us to continue to maintain the strong momentum within our business that we have. 
As you know, we continue also to aggressively increase our spend overall against our marketing platforms. And that will only be expanded when you think about some of the innovation agenda. So we're very optimistic about the whole platform, but getting much beyond that, I think, in any 1 year is probably not the best way to approach that question.

As it relates to our hedging position, as you know, we have a fairly robust and sophisticated hedging policy that allows us to layer in hedges on both commodities and on currencies over the course of many years to take advantage of favorable rates. That -- so we've done that in order to mitigate what otherwise may have been higher inflation this year. That being said, we are not fully hedged in any one thing, whether that's currency or commodities.

Our view is that's likely because you have a significant higher percentage of either early or less consistent users. So it wasn't really a surprise. It still remains a growth sector within the beer industry. 
Our forecast is that it's going to continue to grow, and it's continuing to be a very important part, which is why we're more than doubling our capabilities against hard seltzer for this particular year coming that we're just starting. We believe this is going to be an important part, and it also provides an interesting entree for people into the overall beer category.
Relative to the market share. As you know, as we expanded our capabilities, that allowed us to do additional SKUs. We did almost 10 million cases this past year with 1 SKU, which is kind of an outstanding launch, if you will. But the expansion that we are putting in place is going to allow us to more than double that. We've already introduced SKU #2 and #2 Variety Pack, and we have Limonada coming online here this coming June. 
So our expectation is you'll see a significant increase in our share proposition, in part, because we'll have more available to the consumer, and we'll have more shelf space on the warm shelf and more cold box space in the cold box as well.

So we certainly would expect some of that. I think the open question it's very difficult to predict, quite frankly, is where the whole channel mix ends up going. It's an open question. 
As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise channel than some of our competitors because our overall profile skews more to the off-premise anyway. But certainly, we're optimistic. And as more of the U.S. population gets vaccinated, we're hopeful that in the summer months, it begins to look a little bit more like what a typical year would be.

And then Garth, maybe touch on how you're thinking about the mix between share buybacks and dividends. It seems evident from the release, just a 1% dividend increase. Why so little?

Consistently, you're seeing 4-week trends in IRI that are up in the 30-plus percent range. The core business in Southern California continues to do extremely well, and it's developing across the country. Again, we're really just scratching the surface of building out what this brand could be. 
But my old friend, Bill Hackett always said, Pacifico's starting to look a lot like Modelo look, about 15 to 20 years ago in terms of the development and how it really started out in the California base. As you know, Modelo is now the #1 brand in the state of California. I'm not making a prediction that Pacifico will be the #1 brand, but it wouldn't be the worst thing that ever happened. 
So certainly, there's just a lot to be excited about. You then add in that we're starting to do some innovation and some innovation testing in that brand with Gen Z consumers. This brand very much over-indexes with Gen Z consumers. So we're bringing in a somewhat different audience than what we have with some of our other franchises.

And we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in our business. As we talked about, investing significantly in Mexico to support the robust growth of our portfolio. So all of that goes into the mix when we're trying to decide where to spend the money. 
And so -- and as it relates specifically to dividends versus share buybacks, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our payout ratio, right in the target of what we've set for ourselves. So that's why we didn't increase it more. And by keeping it where we are, we're able to do all those other things that I said: return a significant amount of money in share repurchases, invest behind the brands, maintain our investment-grade rating."

Relative to on-premise, remember, today, it's only 6% of our business as it currently stands because of the significant decrease that's occurred based on COVID. So our expectation is we're still going to see very robust growth in the off-premise during this fiscal year. And as you've seen, we're consistent with our long-term growth algorithm that we've seen. Already stated, March is off to an excellent start. So we're very optimistic about that algorithm. 
But with that said, we -- it's also going to be difficult to exactly predict what will happen with the on-premise because we've already seen, as markets have opened and then closed a little bit and reopened, there's just a lot of variability that's hard to predict. 
Again, while there is an overexpression in the off-premise, that isn't the worst thing for us. Our business is over skewed into that area, and we continue to expect robust growth within the off-premise channel for this fiscal year."

One of the things that we've been quite good at over the last several years is running our plants at hyper efficiency. But I think one thing is learning from the pandemic, and I think if any good business should have an element of learning when something hits you in the face. And the pandemic certainly did that across many, many, many industries. 
One of the things we learned is while our efficiency was tremendous, we didn't have a lot of flexibility in the event that something didn't go well. And so one of the pieces that we are doing with this expansion is not only to meet the hyper growth that we have within our business, but also to create some increasing flexibility and some redundancy within our business. So then if you have weather challenges or, god forbid, we have another pandemic, but if you had weather challenges or some other curveballs that occurred, it would have minimal to no impact on our ongoing supply. So that was very important.
Relative to the Southeast, we are considering that. It's critically important to have water supply. There's actually a lot of shipping capabilities from some of the areas that we are looking into. So we're pretty confident that, that could very well be a future location for a brewery for us. Admittedly, that's a bit out. It takes 2 to 4 years to even get that process going and underway. But we're certainly evaluating it because we think it could be a long-term very viable solution for our business."

Good morning and welcome to everyone to our first quarter conference call. 
Picking right up where we left off in Q4, our Constellation Brands team, with the help of our distributors and retailers, delivered another strong performance in Q1 of fiscal '22. While we overlap the pantry loading phase of the pandemic, which led to record trends in off-premise track channels last year, our continued focus on brand building, aggressive investments in growth and the continued efforts of our team and trade partners position us to deliver another strong year of performance, consistent with our long-term goals. 
As Garth and I detail some of the highlights from Q1, there are several key factors we'd like you to keep in mind that constitute our points of differentiation, our competitive strengths and reasons to continue to believe in the future growth potential of our business and our ability to drive industry-leading total shareholder returns over the long term. 
Number one, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine and spirits continues to gain momentum while offering significant runway for growth in the years ahead. Nowhere is this more evident than in our beer business, which is off to an exceptional start, delivering double-digit depletions, shipments, net sales and operating income growth due to ongoing strong consumer demand. 
Number two, we continue to be relentless about keeping consumers at the forefront of our decision-making, and this is nowhere more apparent than in the strides we're making to strengthen our innovation capabilities and ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. 
Number three, our investment in Canopy growth, along with the continued efforts of the Canopy team, are positioning this business to emerge as a leader in the global cannabis market as it comes to fruition and we inch closer to legalization in the U.S. 
And number four, our continued strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity with significant repurchases of more than $500 million during the first 4 months of our fiscal year. 
In addition, we announced this morning that we will execute an accelerated share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the second quarter to repurchase an additional incremental $500 million of shares. We believe this demonstrates our strong commitment to maximize shareholder value, and we are on our way to achieving our $5 billion goal, of which about 50% will be in the form of share repurchases. This activity is also driving an increase in our EPS guidance for this year. 
Let's transition to a more detailed discussion of our performance in the quarter. As mentioned, our beer business is off to an exceptional start, delivering double-digit net sales and operating income growth as well as depletion growth of almost 11% in the quarter. Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays led to market share gains as Constellation remains a leading growth driver in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
Modelo Especial led the way as the #1 share gainer in the entire U.S. beer category and solidified its position as the #1 brand in the high-end. It also became the #2 brand in dollar sales in IRI channels, posting depletion growth of 12% for the quarter. Modelo Especial continues to fire on all cylinders, with no signs of letting up, driven by ongoing strong execution at retail, impactful execution of high-profile marketing activations and a significant increase in digital, social and e-commerce media for properties like UFC, Gold Cup Soccer and the Summer Olympic Games, to name just a few. 
Corona brand family growth was driven by a return to growth in on-premise channels, which now represent approximately 11% of our beer business volume, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. During the quarter, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which continues to gain shelf space and is already more than half the size of Variety Pack #1 in dollar sales and appears to have about the same incrementality as Variety Pack #1 has to the entire portfolio. Meanwhile, Variety Pack #1 has held its distribution and velocity levels since the launch of Variety Pack 2, and our Hard Seltzer family remains in the #4 market position. 
Earlier this month, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada. And while it's early in the launch cycle, initial consumer response has been very favorable. Ultimately, we believe the hard seltzer category will be dominated by a few large brands in the long run, similar to the light beer category, and we are positioning Corona Hard Seltzer to be one of those brands. We have plans to more than double our seltzer and AVA capabilities this fiscal year and expect to bring another 5 million hectoliters of capacity online next fiscal year, giving us the flexibility to continue to expand with new flavors, new packages and even new platforms in this space. 
Overall, the seltzer category remains competitive. We believe it's an important part of the high-end, and we plan to drive for success with our ambition to ultimately be a top 3 player in this space. 
Pacifico continued its strong momentum, posting depletion growth of more than 35% for the quarter as the #4 share gainer within the import segment driven by our focus on Gen Z consumers. As expected, during the quarter, Constellation's consumer takeaway trends in the off-premise IRI and Nielsen channels were muted due to lapping last year's pantry loading behavior at the start of the pandemic. Conversely, we experienced robust growth, especially in some of the more sizable nontrack channels, including the on-premise, which grew depletions 250% versus last year when this channel was essentially closed, and the liquor chains, which grew almost 13% in the first quarter. These levels of robust consumer demand are impacting availability for certain package sizes in certain geographies. We are working with our distributor partners to ensure consumers can continue to find our brands on shelf throughout the summer, and we plan to make up some of this impact beginning in the third quarter. 
As a reminder, beginning in April of last year, our beer business had to significantly slow down production in Mexico due to COVID-19 restrictions. This led to out of stocks in the U.S. marketplace during the summer month. Therefore, as we progress through our second quarter, which runs June through August, we'll start to lap these out-of-stock issues, and we're already beginning to see improving IRI trends. 
Despite the short-term supply challenges we're facing, the momentum of our portfolio is stronger than ever, and our outlook for the remainder of the year remains extremely bullish. Our view is reinforced by recent 4-week IRI trends that show Constellation's beer business is outpacing the high-end and continues to significantly outpace the total U.S. beer industry. 
Now moving on to wine and spirits. Our transformation of this business to a higher-growth, higher-margin operation continues to gain traction, and we made additional progress during the first quarter on a number of fronts, including furthering our fine wine and craft spirit strategy, building a robust innovation pipeline, advancing our DTC e-commerce and digital capabilities while also implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other costs and efficiency improvements. 
During the quarter, we made progress with the evolution of our fine wine and craft spirits business, especially as consumers return to bars and restaurants in the on-premise channel. Our fine wine and craft spirits performance in the quarter was driven primarily by The Prisoner Wine Company, Robert Mondavi Winery and High West, and we expect our enhanced capabilities in this space to begin to meaningfully inflect our wine and spirits business towards the higher end. 
Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth during the quarter, including Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, which were among the top 10 innovations across the high end of the U.S. wine segment in IRI channels during the quarter. And we have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the remainder of the year, which includes the introductions of Woodbridge wine seltzers, The Prisoner Saldo, Red Blend and Unshackled [indiscernible], plus Robert Mondavi Private Selection 100, a new lineup composed of 100% cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals. 
We've also been investing to build a world-class 3 tier e-commerce team by expanding our sales and marketing resources, building new selling capabilities, investing millions of dollars where consumers shop and integrating our teams to put focus and expertise closer to our accounts. While our 3 tier e-commerce business is cycling the tremendous acceleration that was experienced last spring at the beginning of the pandemic, it is still growing 3 to 4x compared to the spring of 2019 across beer, wine and spirits. And the DTC portion of our e-commerce business saw impressive growth of 45% versus last year in the first quarter. 
We continue to forge partnerships with existing and emergent pure-play retailers like Amazon, Gopuff and Wine.com, omnichannel retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons and third-party marketplaces like Instacart and Drizly, so that our consumers can shop whenever and wherever on their own terms. 
In addition, as part of our commitment to invest $100 million over 10 years in [indiscernible] and minority-owned small businesses, we recently made investments in La Fête du Rosé and Sapere Aude sparkling line. Both of these brands aligned with Constellation's premiumization strategy and presents significant growth opportunities with differentiated high-end brands and growing sectors of the market. 
La Fête du rosé has taken a consumer-first approach to building a distinctive, authentic rosé brand that appeals to multicultural consumers. And Sapere Aude has taken an entrepreneurial approach to build a uniquely Californian sparkling wine with no residual sugars, low alcohol content, fine bubbles and a refreshing brand identity that is simple and clean. We look forward to working with these brands and their dynamic founders to expand their access to key markets and consumers and to help realize their full potential. 
At the same time, our wine and spirits results for the quarter were impacted by a convergence of isolated factors. First, our international brands like Kim Crawford and Ruffino, which are produced in their respective regions but sold primarily in the U.S., are experiencing global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions like so many other imported products. Second, we've experienced some start-up issues in certain markets associated with our route-to-market transition to Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, which now has distribution responsibility across 70% of our U.S. wine and spirits brand portfolio. This transition became effective April 1, and we expect the transition issues to be resolved in the second quarter. Lastly, like many ERP system implementations, with a cutover to SAP, we have encountered a few transitional challenges, which we don't see as a prolonged issue. Collectively, these issues caused some supply challenges at retail for some of our larger key brands, which drove the negative depletion trend during the quarter. And while we're seeing lower inventory levels than normal for Kim and Ruffino, they continue to drive growth. Despite these temporary challenges, we are confident in our ability to accelerate the growth and profitability of this higher end portfolio of industry-leading brands and achieving our targeted goal of 2% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. 
Moving on to Canopy growth. The synergies between Constellation and Canopy growth continue to create value for both companies. Canopy recently signed a U.S. distribution agreement with Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits for Canopy's Quatreau CBD beverage portfolio, which will be launched across 7 U.S. states with additional states to be added later this year, as well as their Martha Stewart CBD product lineup, which has seen early success extending into top-selling gifts for occasions, including Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, which sold out prior to the holidays due to high consumer demand. Constellation and Canopy will continue to work closely together to develop Canopy's route-to-market strategy in the U.S. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Federal U.S. legalization during this congressional session and are bullish about Canopy's growth prospects and their ability to achieve profitability by the end of their fiscal year. 
As I close, I want to take a minute to thank our Constellation team members and our distributors and retailers for an excellent first quarter business performance. Thanks to all of you, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine and spirits continues to gain momentum. And we are well positioned to deliver another strong year of performance, consistent with our long-term goals. 
Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the U.S. beer market, and we're delivering market share gains and accelerating depletion trends as consumer demand and takeaway remains extremely strong. Our higher end wine and spirits brands continued to outpace the overall U.S. market. We continue to strengthen our innovation capabilities to ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. 
Our continued strong operating performance and strong cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and drove an increase in our EPS guidance for the year. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth?"

Our fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, demonstrated by our strong segment operating results and cash flow generation.

Our fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, demonstrated by our strong segment operating results and cash flow generation. As Bill highlighted, our beer business achieved double-digit depletion volume, top line and operating income growth. Our wine and spirits business is nicely positioned to drive accelerated growth and profitability from its portfolio of higher end industry-leading brands. And our robust cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity, reaffirming our commitment to execute our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through our fiscal 2023. 
As Bill outlined, through June, we've repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $523 million. In addition, this morning, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement to purchase $500 million of incremental shares, which is expected to be completed no later than October of 2021. Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes the $500 million incremental share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. 
As a result, we've increased our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.30. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact and reflects the decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding driven by the year -- the June year-to-date share buyback activity as well as the ASR agreement or approximately $1 billion of share repurchases. As such, we are forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 193 million for our fiscal 2022. We plan to repurchase additional shares during the back half of the fiscal year in excess of the $1 billion of share repurchases previously outlined. However, we do not know the timing and cadence. And as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year. 
Now let's review our Q1 fiscal 2022 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of over 11% and favorable pricing. The increase in beer net sales was impacted by some missed shipping days and supply shortages as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico early in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Depletion volume accelerated from fiscal 2021 year-end trends and achieved nearly 11% growth for the quarter despite overlapping the peak of last year's pandemic-related pantry loading behavior driven by continued strong demand in both track and nontrack off-premise channels as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. On-premise volume accounted for 11% of total beer depletions during the quarter, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. 
As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 3% of our depletion volume in Q1 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns due to COVID-19. 
Lastly, when adjusting for 1 extra selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated nearly 10% depletion volume growth. And in Q2, depletion selling days are flat year-over-year. 
Due to continued robust consumer demand and muted shipment volume driven by supply challenges due to severe winter weather early in the quarter, depletion volume exceeded shipment volume during the first quarter, resulting in lower-than-normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of Q1. Let me assure you that we are fully producing and shipping product out of our breweries. However, inventories will remain tight throughout the second quarter as we enter our peak summer selling season. As a result, we expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels during the second half of the fiscal year. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 42.8%. Benefits from favorable pricing, SG&A as a percent of net sales and foreign currency were partially offset by unfavorable logistics and operational costs and increased marketing. The increase in logistics cost was driven primarily by increased obsolescence, resulting from initial conservative expiration dates on new SKUs, partially offset by the transition of a portion of our co-packing capabilities to our Nava brewery. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by brewery costs, largely due to labor inflation in Mexico and increased headcount and incremental spend to bring the additional 5 million hectoliters online at Obregon. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to the overlap of reduced production in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 safety measures. 
Depreciation expense had a minimal impact during the quarter as we began to depreciate the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon late in Q1 but expect depreciation expense to ramp up during Q2. 
Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 9.4% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted, resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. 
As communicated last quarter, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to repurpose this site for future use. As such, an impairment of approximately [ $665 ] million was recorded for the quarter, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. 
For full year fiscal 2022, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin to land in the low to midpoint of our stated 39% to 40% range. 
As previously discussed, we continue to expect our gross margins to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following headwinds: first, a significant step-up in depreciation expense and other brewery expansion costs relating to the incremental 5 million hectoliters that was completed at Obregon earlier in the fiscal year; second, substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components; and lastly, negative mix as we expand our ABA and hard seltzer portfolios. 
As it relates to timing and cadence. As mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, we will begin to see an impact from depreciating the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon, which will be a significant margin headwind for the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, due to benefits from our commodity hedging program, we did not experience the expected cost inflationary pressures during this quarter. However, we expect significant inflation headwinds to ramp up during the second half of our fiscal year as current hedges roll off. In addition, we believe the depth and duration of inflationary pressures are becoming more uncertain as the year unfolds. 
Lastly, we continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for full year fiscal 2022, which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. We expect to invest significantly during Q2 of fiscal 2022 to support strategic initiatives and continue generating strong marketplace performance throughout the key summer selling season. As such, 2Q marketing as a percent of net sales is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% versus Q2 fiscal '21, which came in 8.4%. 
Moving to wine and spirits. Q1 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 22% and shipment volume down 38%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 16% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 6%, smoke tainted bulk wine sales and favorable price and mix, while depletion volume declined approximately 8%. 
There are several dynamics to point out as it relates to organic net sales as well as shipment and depletion volume trends for the quarter. Starting with organic net sales and organic shipment volume. Growth of 16% and 6%, respectively, was impacted by the following: first, smoke tainted bulk wine sales accounted for approximately 4 points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth in the quarter; second, from an organic shipment volume perspective, we undershipped depletions in Q1 fiscal 2021 as we were unable to fulfill excessive consumer demand driven by pantry loading, creating an easy shipment volume compare to Q1 fiscal 2022. Conversely, we overshipped in Q1 fiscal 2022 as a result of the distributor transition to Southern Glazer's in order to ensure that they had ample inventory during the quarter as there was a delay in transitioning Constellation inventory from canceled distributors to Southern Glazer's. 
Moving to depletion volume trends, down approximately 8%, which were impacted by the following: first, we are experiencing a challenging overlap due to last year's pandemic-related consumer pantry loading behavior; second, as a result of the SAP transition, we experienced challenges that impacted the shipping process early in the quarter. While we were able to rectify the situation during the quarter, the timing of shipments throughout Q1 negatively impacted depletions and created out of stocks for some of our larger key brands. Lastly, global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions, have also created out of stocks in certain areas for Kim Crawford and Ruffino, which are imported from New Zealand and Italy, respectively. As Bill mentioned, we believe these challenges are temporary and continue to improve, and we expect to refill retailer inventory in Q2. 
Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 22.9% as mix benefits driven by the wine and spirits divestitures and favorable price were more than offset by margin dilutive smoke tainted wine -- bulk wine sales and increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales. Keep in mind that we're lapping lower marketing and SG&A spend in Q1 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and have a smaller business post the divestitures, resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging, impacting operating margins. 
For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25%, respectively. This implies operating margin to approximate 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. 
Lastly, please keep in mind that we will continue to lap significantly reduced marketing spend during Q2 as many of our planned media and event sponsorship investments were suspended or canceled in Q2 fiscal 2021. Furthermore, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result from the wine and spirits divestitures. As such, we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q2 fiscal 2022. 
Now let's proceed with the rest of P&L. Q1 corporate expenses came in at approximately $55 million, up 8% versus Q1 fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. We continue to expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $235 million. 
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 13% to approximately $87 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our net leverage ratio and ended the quarter at 3.06x, excluding Canopy equity earnings. 
Our previous guidance assumed free cash flow would be used to pay down debt versus share repurchases. However, as discussed earlier, updated guidance now reflects approximately $1 billion of share repurchases through the first half. As such, [ fiscal to ] interest expense is now expected to increase and be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 21.1% versus 19.3% last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We expect our Q2 fiscal '22 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings impact, to approximate 20%. However, we continue to expect the full year to approximate 19%. As expected, stock-based compensation benefits are weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. 
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $602 million, which represents an 11% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. CapEx totaled $114 million or 21% last year's spend. This included approximately $86 million of beer CapEx, primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Lower CapEx spend is primarily due to timing as we have significant spending planned for the balance of the fiscal year. As such, our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions, remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. 
Moving to Canopy. In Q1, we recognized an unrealized loss of $745 million from the decrease in the fair value of our Canopy investments. This was excluded from our comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is [ $366 ] million. 
In closing, I want to reiterate our expectation to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility throughout our fiscal 2022, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders while making strategic investments to support long-term growth opportunities. We believe the combination of strong cash flow and future growth prospects in both our beer and wine and spirits businesses positions Constellation for success. The growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best in class, and we expect it to remain as such well into the future, while the transformation of our wine and spirits business is underway and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate operating margins of approximately 30%. 
And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

With that said, all of that will take care of itself over the course of the fiscal year. 
We -- it's quite different, quite frankly, from last year where we mainly produced the SKUs that represented 75% of our total portfolio. This year, we're producing all of our SKUs. So it's very different from what we saw last year.

So we think June is going to look pretty good. 
Secondly, relative to household, Nik, we obviously are continuing to develop and broaden our reach across our core brands, particularly in beer. If you think about Modelo -- and Garth and I think said this in prior quarters, we are rapidly increasing our penetration in the non-Hispanic community. It's a little difficult for us at this point to break that out of how much of that was COVID versus non-COVID because we're just seeing such an acceleration of Modelo, not only in its core Hispanic market, but in the broader market as well. So it's a little difficult for us to put an exact percentage on any of those things. What 
I would say is we are gaining consumers in our portfolio, that has been obvious, and we expect that trend to continue. Part of that has been driven by our innovation agenda where we're meeting more consumer needs, more consumer drinking occasions than we ever have before because of our successful innovation agenda across the whole portfolio across the company. So I would expect that we're going to continue to see some acceleration of bringing new consumers in because we're opening up occasions for those people to come into our franchise."

And just as a reminder, when we issued our Q4 guidance, we talked about inflation, and we said that overall, we were expecting inflation kind of in the low to mid-single-digit range. And that was taking into account that any given line item within our cost structure, we were seeing inflation in kind of the low to high single-digit range. We have -- as we talked about it at that time, we have a pretty effective hedging policy in place, and we entered the year in a good position, as I said. 
So as we look out this year, first of all, the outlook for inflation still kind of remains the same. Our outlook as well as some of the external advice we get on this is still that inflation is going to have a bit of a spike, but it's going to be temporary in nature. The question just is like how temporary, right? It seems as though that kind of blip, it might take a little bit longer to kind of come down from there. And so the things that we're watching mostly right now really are around, as you indicated, logistics and transportation and labor. And those things are somewhat intertwined, if you will. The labor market has made it difficult to get dedicated trucking lines. And so that's becoming more and more competitive. So that's absolutely a concern. We continue to watch aluminum. And then we look at natural gas -- or glass, right, glass because glass is impacted by natural gas. So those are the areas that we're kind of most watchful for as we go through the year. 
I say that as we sit here today, we're feeling like we're in a similar position to be able to cover our inflationary headwinds as long as they don't get significantly worse as we go through the year."

Really as we speak. 
I got to remind you again what I said earlier, which is despite doubling the size of our ABA and hard seltzer capability for this year, the #1 growth driver in our portfolio will remain Modelo, irrespective of that significant growth. So we're very comfortable with our growth profile across the business. 
What I would say is this, is we do have significant flexibility around the capacity that we put in and how that can be used within the business, and many of the things like packaging and so forth really service the entire business anyway. So we do have a fair amount of flexibility, depending on if there's any changes in any of the particular subsegments of the beer category at any point in time.

So we're very pleased with our transformation as it relates to top line growth. 
In terms of the margin journey, what we've always said around that is it was going to take us about 2 years post divestiture to get to 30% operating margins. And in order to get to that 30% operating margin, it was going to take a number of different things. There was pricing. There's mix. There's the cost takeout that we've talked about previously -- stranded cost takeout of around $130 million, not all of which will fall to the bottom line, some of that we will reinvest behind the brands to make sure that we have strong brands that can generate the top line growth as well as other initiatives around footprint optimization as a result of the Gallo divestiture, not only did we shed a large number of brands, but we also sent [ 7 ] wineries, [ 7 ] facilities with that transaction. So there's a footprint optimization as well as doing some cost optimization to make sure that the products we're putting in the bottle most reflect what the consumers are looking to get when they pick up those brands. So that -- we're well underway. 
We certainly didn't sit back and wait for the transaction to close to identify those cost savings and those initiatives. So we're just now executing against those. But as you say, we're at that interim period where the business is a bit deleveraged. And so until the rest of those costs comes out, we -- you'll see that kind of that downward [indiscernible], as you noted this year, as we move to the 30% operating margins at the end of -- sorry, 2 years post divestiture."

Let me take that one, Greg. The -- we have seen it accelerate tremendously. But as we've seen over the course of the last 18 months around the pandemic, you often see some things where you get starts and stops and things improve in certain states and don't improve in other states and so on and so forth. I think the important thing from our perspective to look at is while we've seen 250% growth in our depletions in the quarter versus prior year, the overall percentage of our business that the on-premise represents is still a bit less than it was in fiscal year -- or in calendar -- excuse me, calendar year '19. So we still think there's still some opportunity and acceleration to come. 
We also have had an exceptional -- and our distributor network does an exceptional job of winning the times that matter, things like the Fourth of July, Labor Day. We did it with Cinco de Mayo. We did it with Memorial Day. So we still think there's going to be some good opportunities for acceleration. 
The challenge to predict, how much of the channel shifting that occurred, there was a massive amount of channel shifting that occurred a year ago when you went heavily to the off-premise. You're now seeing the on-premise comes back on, and the IRI and Nielsen data has been somewhat muted. So we also have seen, as we noted in our scripts, a significant increase in our 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer across the business. So how all those channels sort of shake out is a real question. I think the encouraging part remains that consumer demand against our business across all channels that we can track has been extraordinarily strong. And we're excited, and we think that will continue, irrespective of which channel the consumer chooses to engage in."

And then just a clarification on -- also in the inventory and shipments. Is it fair to say that given that you have a very easy comp on the production in April, right, so going to have a lot of like inventory that you haven't built yet, but it is due on transit from Mexico, is that something that gives you some comfort that -- even though you said, you only see the normalization by the third quarter, that the second quarter is still going to be a very strong shipment quarter?"

Keep in mind, based on what we can see, per capita consumption has remained pretty steady throughout the pandemic. It's just that where and how people consume has moved around quite a bit. So it's really difficult to precisely predict how consumers are going to operate. And I think it's going to vary, as I said a moment ago, quite a bit by state, depending on the individual restrictions and whether or not certain states are still allowing takeaway from a restaurant environment for alcoholic beverages, some are not. So until all this dynamic plays itself out, I think it's going to be very difficult to predict exactly how the consumer will land. Other than I would say, some of the sheer shopping behavior where you see 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer changes are going to continue. 
As we said in prior calls, we have made major investments to increase our capability in 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, and I'm very glad that we did. It's playing out well, and it's showing tremendous takeaway in those sectors, which have grown around the pandemic. 
As it relates to inventory, we continue to believe we're going to have a very solid year. We're in a good position to make up the challenge that was the onetime challenge around the power outage that occurred in February.

And then mix, I think mix is also something that's going to impact us again more as we go through the year. We started the year really with kind of one SKU in Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #1. Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2 was just launched at the beginning, and then we launched Limonada here in June. So there will be more mix impact as we go through the balance of the year as well.

Picking right up where we left off in Q4, our Constellation Brands team, with the help of our distributors and retailers, delivered another strong performance i",2227,"Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to everyone to our first quarter conference call. 
Picking right up where we left off in Q4, our Constellation Brands team, with the help of our distributors and retailers, delivered another strong performance in Q1 of fiscal '22. While we overlap the pantry-loading phase of the pandemic, which led to record trends in off-premise track channels last year, our continued focus on brand building, aggressive investments in growth and the continued efforts of our team and trade partners position us to deliver another strong year of performance, consistent with our long-term goals. 
As Garth and I detail some of the highlights from Q1, there are several key factors we'd like you to keep in mind that constitute our points of differentiation, our competitive strengths and reasons to continue to believe in the future growth potential of our business and our ability to drive industry-leading total shareholder returns over the long term. 
Number one, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine and spirits continues to gain momentum while offering significant runway for growth in the years ahead. Nowhere is this more evident than in our beer business, which is off to an exceptional start, delivering double-digit depletions, shipments, net sales and operating income growth due to ongoing strong consumer demand. 
Number two, we continue to be relentless about keeping consumers at the forefront of our decision-making, and this is nowhere more apparent than in the strides we're making to strengthen our innovation capabilities and ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. 
Number three, our investment in Canopy Growth, along with the continued efforts of the Canopy team, are positioning this business to emerge as a leader in the global cannabis market as it comes to fruition and we inch closer to legalization in the U.S. 
And number four, our continued strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity with significant repurchases of more than $500 million during the first 4 months of our fiscal year. 
In addition, we announced this morning that we will execute an accelerated share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the second quarter to repurchase an additional incremental $500 million of shares. We believe this demonstrates our strong commitment to maximize shareholder value, and we are on our way to achieving our $5 billion goal, of which about 50% will be in the form of share repurchases. This activity is also driving an increase in our EPS guidance for this year. 
Let's transition to a more detailed discussion of our performance in the quarter. As mentioned, our beer business is off to an exceptional start, delivering double-digit net sales and operating income growth as well as depletion growth of almost 11% in the quarter. Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays led to market share gains as Constellation remains a leading growth driver in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
Modelo Especial led the way as the #1 share gainer in the entire U.S. beer category and solidified its position as the #1 brand in the high-end. It also became the #2 brand in dollar sales in IRI channels, posting depletion growth of 12% for the quarter. Modelo Especial continues to fire on all cylinders, with no signs of letting up, driven by ongoing strong execution at retail, impactful execution of high-profile marketing activations and a significant increase in digital, social and e-commerce media for properties like UFC, Gold Cup Soccer and the Summer Olympic Games, to name just a few. 
Corona brand family growth was driven by a return to growth in on-premise channels, which now represent approximately 11% of our beer business volume, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. During the quarter, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which continues to gain shelf space and is already more than half the size of Variety Pack #1 in dollar sales and appears to have about the same incrementality as Variety Pack #1 has to the entire portfolio. Meanwhile, Variety Pack #1 has held its distribution and velocity levels since the launch of Variety Pack #2, and our Hard Seltzer family remains in the #4 market position. 
Earlier this month, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada. And while it's early in the launch cycle, initial consumer response has been very favorable. Ultimately, we believe the hard seltzer category will be dominated by a few large brands in the long run, similar to the light beer category, and we are positioning Corona Hard Seltzer to be one of those brands. We have plans to more than double our seltzer and ABA capabilities this fiscal year and expect to bring another 5 million hectoliters of capacity online next fiscal year, giving us the flexibility to continue to expand with new flavors, new packages and even new platforms in this space. 
Overall, the seltzer category remains competitive. We believe it's an important part of the high-end, and we plan to drive for success with our ambition to ultimately be a top 3 player in this space. 
Pacifico continued its strong momentum, posting depletion growth of more than 35% for the quarter as the #4 share gainer within the import segment driven by our focus on Gen Z consumers. As expected, during the quarter, Constellation's consumer takeaway trends in the off-premise IRI and Nielsen channels were muted due to lapping last year's pantry-loading behavior at the start of the pandemic. 
Conversely, we experienced robust growth, especially in some of the more sizable nontrack channels, including the on-premise, which grew depletions 250% versus last year when this channel was essentially closed, and the liquor chains, which grew almost 13% in the first quarter. These levels of robust consumer demand are impacting availability for certain package sizes in certain geographies. We are working with our distributor partners to ensure consumers can continue to find our brands on shelf throughout the summer, and we plan to make up some of this impact beginning in the third quarter. 
As a reminder, beginning in April of last year, our beer business had to significantly slow down production in Mexico due to COVID-19 restrictions. This led to out of stocks in the U.S. marketplace during the summer month. Therefore, as we progress through our second quarter, which runs June through August, we'll start to lap these out-of-stock issues, and we're already beginning to see improving IRI trends. 
Despite the short-term supply challenges we're facing, the momentum of our portfolio is stronger than ever, and our outlook for the remainder of the year remains extremely bullish. Our view is reinforced by recent 4-week IRI trends that show Constellation's beer business is outpacing the high-end and continues to significantly outpace the total U.S. beer industry. 
Now moving on to wine and spirits. Our transformation of this business to a higher-growth, higher-margin operation continues to gain traction, and we made additional progress during the first quarter on a number of fronts, including furthering our fine wine and craft spirit strategy, building a robust innovation pipeline, advancing our DTC e-commerce and digital capabilities while also implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other costs and efficiency improvements. 
During the quarter, we made progress with the evolution of our fine wine and craft spirits business, especially as consumers return to bars and restaurants in the on-premise channel. Our fine wine and craft spirits performance in the quarter was driven primarily by The Prisoner Wine Company, Robert Mondavi Winery and High West, and we expect our enhanced capabilities in this space to begin to meaningfully inflect our wine and spirits business towards the higher end. 
Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth during the quarter, including Meiomi cabernetsauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, which were among the top 10 innovations across the high end of the U.S. wine segment in IRI channels during the quarter. And we have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the remainder of the year, which includes the introductions of Woodbridge wine seltzers, The Prisoner Saldo, Red Blend and Unshackled sauvignon blanc, plus Robert Mondavi Private Selection 100, a new lineup composed of 100% cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals. 
We've also been investing to build a world-class 3 tier e-commerce team by expanding our sales and marketing resources, building new selling capabilities, investing millions of dollars where consumers shop and integrating our teams to put focus and expertise closer to our accounts. While our 3 tier e-commerce business is cycling the tremendous acceleration that was experienced last spring at the beginning of the pandemic, it is still growing 3 to 4x compared to the spring of 2019 across beer, wine and spirits. And the DTC portion of our e-commerce business saw impressive growth of 45% versus last year in the first quarter. 
We continue to forge partnerships with existing and emergent pure-play retailers like Amazon, Gopuff and wine.com, omnichannel retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons and third-party marketplaces like Instacart and Drizly, so that our consumers can shop whenever and wherever on their own terms. 
In addition, as part of our commitment to invest $100 million over 10 years in Black, Latinx and minority-owned small businesses, we recently made investments in La Fête du Rosé and Sapere Aude sparkling line. Both of these brands aligned with Constellation's premiumization strategy and presents significant growth opportunities with differentiated high-end brands and growing sectors of the market. 
La Fête du Rosé has taken a consumer-first approach to building a distinctive, authentic rosé brand that appeals to multicultural consumers. And Sapere Aude has taken an entrepreneurial approach to build a uniquely Californian sparkling wine with no residual sugars, low alcohol content, fine bubbles and a refreshing brand identity that is simple and clean. We look forward to working with these brands and their dynamic founders to expand their access to key markets and consumers and to help realize their full potential. 
At the same time, our wine and spirits results for the quarter were impacted by a convergence of isolated factors. First, our international brands like Kim Crawford and Ruffino, which are produced in their respective regions but sold primarily in the U.S., are experiencing global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions like so many other imported products. 
Second, we've experienced some start-up issues in certain markets associated with our route-to-market transition to Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, which now has distribution responsibility across 70% of our U.S. wine and spirits brand portfolio. This transition became effective April 1, and we expect the transition issues to be resolved in the second quarter. 
Lastly, like many ERP system implementations, with a cutover to SAP, we have encountered a few transitional challenges, which we don't see as a prolonged issue. Collectively, these issues caused some supply challenges at retail for some of our larger key brands, which drove the negative depletion trend during the quarter. And while we're seeing lower inventory levels than normal for Kim and Ruffino, they continue to drive growth. Despite these temporary challenges, we are confident in our ability to accelerate the growth and profitability of this higher end portfolio of industry-leading brands and achieving our targeted goal of 2% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. 
Moving on to Canopy Growth. The synergies between Constellation and Canopy Growth continue to create value for both companies. Canopy recently signed a U.S. distribution agreement with Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits for Canopy's Quatreau CBD beverage portfolio, which will be launched across 7 U.S. states with additional states to be added later this year, as well as their Martha Stewart CBD product lineup, which has seen early success extending into top-selling gifts for occasions, including Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, which sold out prior to the holidays due to high consumer demand. Constellation and Canopy will continue to work closely together to develop Canopy's route-to-market strategy in the U.S. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Federal U.S. legalization during this congressional session and are bullish about Canopy's growth prospects and their ability to achieve profitability by the end of their fiscal year. 
As I close, I want to take a minute to thank our Constellation team members and our distributors and retailers for an excellent first quarter business performance. Thanks to all of you, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine and spirits continues to gain momentum. And we are well positioned to deliver another strong year of performance, consistent with our long-term goals. 
Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the U.S. beer market, and we're delivering market share gains and accelerating depletion trends as consumer demand and takeaway remains extremely strong. Our higher end wine and spirits brands continued to outpace the overall U.S. market. We continue to strengthen our innovation capabilities to ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. 
Our continued strong operating performance and strong cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and drove an increase in our EPS guidance for the year. 
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth?"

Our fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, demonstrated by our strong segment operating results and cash flow generation.

Our fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, demonstrated by our strong segment operating results and cash flow generation. As Bill highlighted, our beer business achieved double-digit depletion volume, top line and operating income growth. Our wine and spirits business is nicely positioned to drive accelerated growth and profitability from its portfolio of higher end industry-leading brands. And our robust cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity, reaffirming our commitment to execute our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through our fiscal 2023. 
As Bill outlined, through June, we've repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $523 million. In addition, this morning, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement to purchase $500 million of incremental shares, which is expected to be completed no later than October of 2021. Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes the $500 million incremental share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. 
As a result, we've increased our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.30. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact and reflects the decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding driven by the year -- the June year-to-date share buyback activity as well as the ASR agreement or approximately $1 billion of share repurchases. As such, we are forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 193 million for our fiscal 2022. We plan to repurchase additional shares during the back half of the fiscal year in excess of the $1 billion of share repurchases previously outlined. However, we do not know the timing and cadence. And as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year. 
Now let's review our Q1 fiscal 2022 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of over 11% and favorable pricing. The increase in beer net sales was impacted by some missed shipping days and supply shortages as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico early in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Depletion volume accelerated from fiscal 2021 year-end trends and achieved nearly 11% growth for the quarter despite overlapping the peak of last year's pandemic-related pantry-loading behavior driven by continued strong demand in both track and nontrack off-premise channels as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. On-premise volume accounted for 11% of total beer depletions during the quarter, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. 
As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 3% of our depletion volume in Q1 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns due to COVID-19. 
Lastly, when adjusting for 1 extra selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated nearly 10% depletion volume growth. And in Q2, depletion selling days are flat year-over-year. 
Due to continued robust consumer demand and muted shipment volume driven by supply challenges due to severe winter weather early in the quarter, depletion volume exceeded shipment volume during the first quarter, resulting in lower-than-normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of Q1. Let me assure you that we are fully producing and shipping product out of our breweries. However, inventories will remain tight throughout the second quarter as we enter our peak summer selling season. As a result, we expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels during the second half of the fiscal year. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 42.8%. Benefits from favorable pricing, SG&A as a percent of net sales and foreign currency were partially offset by unfavorable logistics and operational costs and increased marketing. The increase in logistics cost was driven primarily by increased obsolescence, resulting from initial conservative expiration dates on new SKUs, partially offset by the transition of a portion of our co-packing capabilities to our Nava Brewery. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by brewery costs, largely due to labor inflation in Mexico and increased headcount and incremental spend to bring the additional 5 million hectoliters online at Obregon. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to the overlap of reduced production in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 safety measures. 
Depreciation expense had a minimal impact during the quarter as we began to depreciate the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon late in Q1, but expect depreciation expense to ramp up during Q2. 
Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 9.4% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted, resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. 
As communicated last quarter, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to repurpose this site for future use. As such, an impairment of approximately $665 million was recorded for the quarter, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. 
For full year fiscal 2022, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin to land in the low to midpoint of our stated 39% to 40% range. 
As previously discussed, we continue to expect our gross margins to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following headwinds: first, a significant step-up in depreciation expense and other brewery expansion costs relating to the incremental 5 million hectoliters that was completed at Obregon earlier in the fiscal year; second, substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components; and lastly, negative mix as we expand our ABA and hard seltzer portfolios. 
As it relates to timing and cadence. As mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, we will begin to see an impact from depreciating the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon, which will be a significant margin headwind for the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, due to benefits from our commodity hedging program, we did not experience the expected cost inflationary pressures during this quarter. However, we expect significant inflation headwinds to ramp up during the second half of our fiscal year as current hedges roll off. In addition, we believe the depth and duration of inflationary pressures are becoming more uncertain as the year unfolds. 
Lastly, we continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for full year fiscal 2022, which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. We expect to invest significantly during Q2 of fiscal 2022 to support strategic initiatives and continue generating strong marketplace performance throughout the key summer selling season. As such, 2Q marketing as a percent of net sales is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% versus Q2 fiscal '21, which came in at 8.4%. 
Moving to wine and spirits. Q1 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 22% and shipment volume down 38%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 16% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 6%, smoke-tainted bulk wine sales and favorable price and mix, while depletion volume declined approximately 8%. 
There are several dynamics to point out as it relates to organic net sales as well as shipment and depletion volume trends for the quarter. Starting with organic net sales and organic shipment volume. Growth of 16% and 6%, respectively, was impacted by the following: first, smoke-tainted bulk wine sales accounted for approximately 4 points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth in the quarter; second, from an organic shipment volume perspective, we undershipped depletions in Q1 fiscal 2021 as we were unable to fulfill excessive consumer demand driven by pantry loading, creating an easy shipment volume compare to Q1 fiscal 2022. Conversely, we overshipped in Q1 fiscal 2022 as a result of the distributor transition to Southern Glazer's in order to ensure that they had ample inventory during the quarter as there was a delay in transitioning Constellation inventory from canceled distributors to Southern Glazer's. 
Moving to depletion volume trends, down approximately 8%, which were impacted by the following: first, we are experiencing a challenging overlap due to last year's pandemic-related consumer pantry-loading behavior; second, as a result of the SAP transition, we experienced challenges that impacted the shipping process early in the quarter. While we were able to rectify the situation during the quarter, the timing of shipments throughout Q1 negatively impacted depletions and created out of stocks for some of our larger key brands. Lastly, global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions, have also created out of stocks in certain areas for Kim Crawford and Ruffino, which are imported from New Zealand and Italy, respectively. As Bill mentioned, we believe these challenges are temporary and continue to improve, and we expect to refill retailer inventory in Q2. 
Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 22.9% as mix benefits driven by the wine and spirits divestitures and favorable price were more than offset by margin dilutive smoke-tainted wine -- bulk wine sales and increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales. Keep in mind that we're lapping lower marketing and SG&A spend in Q1 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and have a smaller business post the divestitures, resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging, impacting operating margins. 
For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25%, respectively. This implies operating margin to approximate 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. 
Lastly, please keep in mind that we will continue to lap significantly reduced marketing spend during Q2 as many of our planned media and event sponsorship investments were suspended or canceled in Q2 fiscal 2021. Furthermore, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result from the wine and spirits divestitures. As such, we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q2 fiscal 2022. 
Now let's proceed with the rest of P&L. Q1 corporate expenses came in at approximately $55 million, up 8% versus Q1 fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. We continue to expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $235 million. 
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 13% to approximately $87 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our net leverage ratio and ended the quarter at 3.06x, excluding Canopy equity earnings. 
Our previous guidance assumed free cash flow would be used to pay down debt versus share repurchases. However, as discussed earlier, updated guidance now reflects approximately $1 billion of share repurchases through the first half. As such, fiscal to interest expense is now expected to increase and be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 21.1% versus 19.3% last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We expect our Q2 fiscal '22 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings impact, to approximate 20%. However, we continue to expect the full year to approximate 19%. As expected, stock-based compensation benefits are weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. 
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $602 million, which represents an 11% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. CapEx totaled $114 million or 21% last year's spend. This included approximately $86 million of beer CapEx, primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Lower CapEx spend is primarily due to timing as we have significant spending planned for the balance of the fiscal year. As such, our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions, remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. 
Moving to Canopy. In Q1, we recognized an unrealized loss of $745 million from the decrease in the fair value of our Canopy investments. This was excluded from our comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $366 million. 
In closing, I want to reiterate our expectation to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility throughout our fiscal 2022, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders while making strategic investments to support long-term growth opportunities. We believe the combination of strong cash flow and future growth prospects in both our beer and wine and spirits businesses positions Constellation for success. The growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best in class, and we expect it to remain as such well into the future, while the transformation of our wine and spirits business is underway and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate operating margins of approximately 30%. 
And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

The second piece of it, obviously, was the point that Garth made and I made in my script, which is the power outage that occurred at the end of February, which was made for somewhat tighter inventory position than we would normally want to hold. With that said, all of that will take care of itself over the course of the fiscal year. 
We -- it's quite different, quite frankly, from last year where we mainly produced the SKUs that represented 75% of our total portfolio. This year, we're producing all of our SKUs. So it's very different from what we saw last year. And while we do expect tightness during the course of the summer, we're working actively with our distributors to make sure that we are providing the right mix of product, to make sure that we continue to supply the very strong demand we're seeing against our portfolio."

So we think June is going to look pretty good. 
Secondly, relative to household, Nik, we obviously are continuing to develop and broaden our reach across our core brands, particularly in beer. If you think about Modelo -- and Garth and I think said this in prior quarters, we are rapidly increasing our penetration in the non-Hispanic community. It's a little difficult for us at this point to break that out of how much of that was COVID versus non-COVID because we're just seeing such an acceleration of Modelo, not only in its core Hispanic market, but in the broader market as well. So it's a little difficult for us to put an exact percentage on any of those things. 
What I would say is we are gaining consumers in our portfolio, that has been obvious, and we expect that trend to continue. Part of that has been driven by our innovation agenda where we're meeting more consumer needs, more consumer-drinking occasions than we ever have before because of our successful innovation agenda across the whole portfolio across the company. So I would expect that we're going to continue to see some acceleration of bringing new consumers in because we're opening up occasions for those people to come into our franchise."

And just as a reminder, when we issued our Q4 guidance, we talked about inflation, and we said that overall, we were expecting inflation kind of in the low to mid-single-digit range. And that was taking into account that any given line item within our cost structure, we were seeing inflation in kind of the low to high single-digit range. We have -- as we talked about it at that time, we have a pretty effective hedging policy in place, and we entered the year in a good position, as I said. 
So as we look out this year, first of all, the outlook for inflation still kind of remains the same. Our outlook as well as some of the external advice we get on this is still that inflation is going to have a bit of a spike, but it's going to be temporary in nature. The question just is like how temporary, right? And it seems as though that kind of blip, it might take a little bit longer to kind of come down from there. And so the things that we're watching mostly right now really are around, as you indicated, logistics and transportation and labor. And those things are somewhat intertwined, if you will. The labor market has made it difficult to get dedicated trucking lines. And so that's becoming more and more competitive. So that's absolutely a concern. We continue to watch aluminum. And then we look at natural gas -- or glass, right, glass because glass is impacted by natural gas. So those are the areas that we're kind of most watchful for as we go through the year. 
I say that as we sit here today, we're feeling like we're in a similar position to be able to cover our inflationary headwinds as long as they don't get significantly worse as we go through the year."

I got to remind you again what I said earlier, which is despite doubling the size of our ABA and hard seltzer capability for this year, the #1 growth driver in our portfolio will remain Modelo, irrespective of that significant growth. So we're very comfortable with our growth profile across the business. 
What I would say is this, is we do have significant flexibility around the capacity that we put in and how that can be used within the business, and many of the things like packaging and so forth really service the entire business anyway. So we do have a fair amount of flexibility, depending on if there's any changes in any of the particular subsegments of the beer category at any point in time.

So we're very pleased with our transformation as it relates to top line growth. 
In terms of the margin journey, what we've always said around that is it was going to take us about 2 years post divestiture to get to 30% operating margins. And in order to get to that 30% operating margin, it was going to take a number of different things. There was pricing. There's mix. There's the cost takeout that we've talked about previously -- stranded cost takeout of around $130 million, not all of which will fall to the bottom line, some of that we will reinvest behind the brands to make sure that we have strong brands that can generate the top line growth as well as other initiatives around footprint optimization as a result of the Gallo divestiture, not only did we shed a large number of brands, but we also sent 7 wineries, 7 facilities with that transaction. So there's a footprint optimization as well as doing some cost optimization to make sure that the products we're putting in the bottle most reflect what the consumers are looking to get when they pick up those brands. So that -- we're well underway. 
We certainly didn't sit back and wait for the transaction to close to identify those cost savings and those initiatives. So we're just now executing against those. But as you say, we're at that interim period where the business is a bit deleveraged. And so until the rest of those costs comes out, we -- you'll see that kind of that downward blip, as you noted this year, as we move to the 30% operating margins at the end of -- sorry, 2 years post divestiture."

But as we've seen over the course of the last 18 months around the pandemic, you often see some things where you get starts and stops, and things improve in certain states and don't improve in other states and so on and so forth. I think the important thing from our perspective to look at is while we've seen 250% growth in our depletions in the quarter versus prior year, the overall percentage of our business that the on-premise represents is still a bit less than it was in fiscal year -- or in calendar -- excuse me, calendar year '19. So we still think there's still some opportunity and acceleration to come. 
We also have had an exceptional -- and our distributor network does an exceptional job of winning the times that matter, things like the Fourth of July, Labor Day. We did it with Cinco de Mayo. We did it with Memorial Day. So we still think there's going to be some good opportunities for acceleration. 
The challenge to predict, how much of the channel shifting that occurred, there was a massive amount of channel shifting that occurred a year ago when you went heavily to the off-premise. You're now seeing the on-premise comes back on, and the IRI and Nielsen data has been somewhat muted. So we also have seen, as we noted in our scripts, a significant increase in our 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer across the business. So how all those channels sort of shake out is a real question. I think the encouraging part remains that consumer demand against our business across all channels that we can track has been extraordinarily strong.

Keep in mind, based on what we can see, per capita consumption has remained pretty steady throughout the pandemic. It's just that where and how people consume has moved around quite a bit. So it's really difficult to precisely predict how consumers are going to operate. And I think it's going to vary, as I said a moment ago, quite a bit by state, depending on the individual restrictions and whether or not certain states are still allowing takeaway from a restaurant environment for alcoholic beverages, some are not. So until all this dynamic plays itself out, I think it's going to be very difficult to predict exactly how the consumer will land. Other than I would say, some of the sheer shopping behavior where you see 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer changes are going to continue. 
As we said in prior calls, we have made major investments to increase our capability in 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, and I'm very glad that we did. It's playing out well, and it's showing tremendous takeaway in those sectors, which have grown around the pandemic. 
As it relates to inventory, we continue to believe we're going to have a very solid year. We're in a good position to make up the challenge that was the onetime challenge around the power outage that occurred in February. And we expect to have, as we've said, a very strong year, and that I would expect would include the second quarter, which is a premise."

It's not running as efficiently as it will -- once we get everything locked and loaded because it's just normal start-up, but it's certainly helping the situation. And we certainly expect to be able to meet consumer demand during our key summer selling season, as I said earlier. We're being -- we're working very carefully with our distributor network and our retail partners to make sure that we are able to meet the demand.

And that's comprised of Obregon, full year first 5 in the glass joint venture, depreciation as well as some other things. Inflation I think we've covered and the fact that, that hit us more in the second half of the year as our hedges kind of roll off. And then mix, I think mix is also something that's going to impact us again more as we go through the year. We started the year really with kind of one SKU in Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #1. Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2 was just launched at the beginning, and then we launched Limonada here in June. So there will be more mix impact as we go through the balance of the year as well.

As I've said to you, I think -- or not to you, but I've said in prior calls, we continue to see opportunities with Modelo, the household penetration with Modelo despite the rapid growth of Modelo.

So we are reaching into that community by, again, meeting new occasions and meeting new consumer needs with those particular products.

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. Let's dive right into a discussion about the quarter. There were a number of puts and takes impacting our results in Q2, and Garth and I will spend time walking through them. However,",2528,"Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. Let's dive right into a discussion about the quarter. There were a number of puts and takes impacting our results in Q2, and Garth and I will spend time walking through them. However, the fundamentals of our business remain solid, and consumer demand for our brands, particularly our core beer portfolio, remains strong. This gives us confidence to increase our EPS guidance for the year, which we outlined in our press release earlier today and Garth will review in more detail shortly. 
In addition, we repurchased a significant number of shares in Q2 at prices that are favorable as we believe Constellation stock is undervalued at current levels. We've received some feedback from investors on this topic in recent weeks, and we'll address key themes that emerge from these discussions in our remarks. 
As we walk through our Q2 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, there are several key takeaways we'd ask you to keep in mind. Number one, the momentum of our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers as we're the leading share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer market. The majority of our growth continues to be driven by Modelo Especial, supported by strong consumer demand for Corona Extra and Pacifico, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that Modelo Especial in particular, has a long runway for growth, given the steadily increasing household penetration for this brand among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity. 
Now we've admittedly had some supply challenges this fiscal year driven by several external factors, the most relevant being the ongoing robust demand for our beer brands. We expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4. Despite these challenges, we continue to be on track to deliver a better-than-expected year for our beer business. In fact, our strong performance to date gives us the confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 9% to 11% net sales growth and 4% to 6% operating income growth for fiscal '22. Our view is reinforced by recent 12-week IRI trends showing the Constellation's beer business is significantly outpacing the high end and total U.S. beer industry. 
Point two. As it relates to our hard seltzer business and building off our last point, we're unique in our position versus our competitors in this space as our primary growth is coming from our core beer portfolio, and we're not reliant on the growth of hard seltzers and ABAs to achieve the medium-term growth goals for our beer business. The hard seltzer landscape has shifted considerably in recent months. Therefore, we've lowered our growth expectations for Corona Hard Seltzer resulting in a sizable obsolescence charge taken for Q2, which includes our view of the total impact for the fiscal year. 
So let's be clear, we continue to see the hard seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector in the beer market, and we continue to believe it's important to participate in and gain our fair share in this segment to complement the growth of our core imported beer portfolio and to maintain our position as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Going forward, we plan to focus on competing in this space in where we offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers. I'll have more to say on this topic in a moment. 
Number three, while our wine and spirits business was challenged in the quarter by underperformance of several mainstream brands due to tough COVID comparisons, our recent route-to-market transition and supply chain challenges for our imported wine brands, we continue to see the benefits of our premiumization strategy take hold. We're performing well in the high end of the wine segment, which represents the vast majority of expected industry growth over the next several years, and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success such as e-commerce and DTC. 
Number four, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, strategic, disciplined and consumer-led approach with a focus on high-growth segments aligned with consumer trends. Our innovation agenda is designed to complement our organic growth, and we're developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business while further premiumizing our portfolio into margin-accretive price points. Over the years, we've been able to extend some of our brands into new spaces, recruiting new drinkers and expanding occasions, and we've achieved a healthy balance between growth from the core and from innovation. 
Number five, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged since I assumed the role of CEO almost 3 years ago. Since then, we've made significant progress in reducing debt and achieving our goal of returning $5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year '23 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In fact, to date, this fiscal year, we have repurchased 1.4 billion of our shares. And when combined with our dividend, we have achieved nearly 60% of our 5 billion goal. 
To be clear, our shareholder value equation is based on outsized growth combined with return of dollars to shareholders. One of the most important capital allocation priorities is to continue reinvesting in our beer business to keep up with robust demand for our products. Despite initial challenges associated with the build-out of a third brewery in Mexico, we have moved on to other capacity alternatives in the country. Our expansions in Nava and Obregon helped ensure we have adequate production capacity for the medium term and will create much needed redundant capacity that better enables us to manage through unexpected events like we've experienced these past 2 years. We continue to work with the Mexican government to solidify plans for a new brewery in Southeastern Mexico with adequate water supply and an available talented workforce. 
Now let's move on to a more fulsome discussion about our performance within the quarter. During the quarter, the Modelo brand family posted depletion growth of 17% for the quarter and single-handedly drove total import share gains in IRI channels on a dollar basis. As the #2 beer brand in dollar sales in the entire U.S. beer category, Modelo Especial is the only major beer brand growing household penetration and is leading the way as the #1 share gainer among high-end brands. Modelo Chelada has become the #2 brand family in the Chelada space, posting depletion growth of more than 50% and for the second quarter. 
Corona Extra continues its growth trajectory as the second fastest share gainer and the #1 loved brand in the import category driven by a return to growth in the on-premise, which currently represents approximately 11% of our beer business volume. 
In addition to the comments I made earlier about our hard seltzers, I'd like to discuss industry trends and our refreshed approach to this sector of the beer market going forward. In the short to medium term, we believe that there will be consolidation within the hard seltzer/ABA space primarily due to the chaos of SKU and brand proliferation with too many new entrants that don't have the velocity or consumer demand to warrant shelf space. We also believe this subcategory will evolve beyond low-calorie, low-carb offerings and open up to more distinctive consumer value propositions that include things like more flavor, different alcohol bases and functional benefits. 
We've already started to innovate in this way with distinct products like Refresca and Lemonada. We've also discovered that consumers are looking for more robust taste and flavor in their seltzers. As a result, we will be altering the flavor and taste profile of our seltzer portfolio to better align with the changing consumer preferences while also introducing single-serve packages to better serve the growing convenience channel, our largest trade channel. And we have a solid lineup of innovation that we have yet to introduce. 
We have several great examples of our innovation strategy at work within our wine and spirits portfolio. This business continues to drive growth from recently launched innovations, including Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate, the Prisoner cabernet and chardonnay, all of which are amongst the top 10 innovations across high-end wine in IRI channels during the quarter. And our wine and spirits innovation pipeline is ready to go with further consumer-led new products as we head into our peak selling period, including the expansion of our SVEDKA ready-to-drink platform and the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzers and [ box ] wines. 
In addition to driving growth through innovation, we're making progress with our core wine and spirits portfolio despite the previously mentioned challenges. We continue to take price to further premiumize our mainstream portfolio as these steps are critical to maintain brand equity and to improve profitability, which will serve our brands well over the long term. 
We're putting points on the board in a number of areas where we're outperforming the U.S. wine market. Our high-end super premium plus portfolio grew net sales double digits during the quarter. In on-premise channels, our investments are paying off with enhanced wine offerings at major restaurant chains. We're driving in critical emerging channels like 3-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, which continued to drive high-end growth, where we're outpacing category performance at key accounts such as Instacart, Amazon and Albertsons with the resurgence of online shopping due to the COVID pandemic. 
For example, Constellation's fine wine share has expanded significantly in the latest 12 weeks due to the robust growth of the Prisoner on Instacart and Robert Mondavi Winery on wine.com. In fact, e-commerce and DTC sales are up nearly 3 to 4x versus 2019, and they comprise roughly 3% to 5% of our business versus 1% pre pandemic. Going forward, we will continue to focus on becoming a category leader in e-commerce and DTC as we believe these channels will make up a significant portion of our mix over time and will continue to be an opportunity for high-end growth. 
I'd also like to provide you an update on our U.S. harvest, which is about 70% complete at this point, while our production facilities, wineries and tasting rooms remain untouched by recent wildfire activity. This quarter, our ventures activities included investments in adaptogen-infused hop water and Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston's artesanal Dos Hombres mezcal. Hop water is a nonalcoholic calorie-free sparkling water, infused with adaptedgens and new tropics to provide the perfect balance of function and flavor for health-conscious consumers. The nonalcoholic segment of total beverage alcohol grew almost 40% in 2020 in dollar sales through IRI channels. And according to IWSR research, 60% of consumers are switching between nonalcoholic or low alcoholic and full strength drinks within the same occasion. 
Dos Hombres is an award-winning handcrafted mezcal brand created by Breaking Bad co-stars who have developed an exceptional liquid that receives frequent praise from both the industry and consumers. The overall U.S. mezcal category grew 14% in 2020 according to IWSR, and super premium mezcal priced above $30 per barrel is projected to be the largest and fastest-growing segment within the category. 
Moving on to Canopy Growth. We're encouraged by the recent introduction of the [ Cannabis Opportunity and Administration Act ] draft bill, which was introduced by Senators Booker, Wyden and Schumer in July. More than 90% of Americans are in favor of cannabis legislation for medical purposes and 2/3 of those are in favor of legalizing for recreational use as well. In fact, nearly 2 out of 3 Americans already have legal cannabis access as 37 states have legalized for medical use and 18 states for adult use. 
While we're optimistic about federal legislation within this congress, Canopy is not waiting for this reality to materialize. Canopy's U.S. business grew 91% year-over-year in their most recent quarter driven by robust consumer demand for their CBD and CPG products, including Martha Stewart-branded products, beverages, stores and -- [ vape ] products and BioSteel's new RTDs. 
Over the coming years, revenue for Canopy's U.S. business is expected to grow significantly as it benefits from increasing distribution and new product introductions. Once THC permissibility becomes a reality in the U.S., Canopy expects their U.S. business to make a substantially greater contribution to their results. 
Canopy has scaled a multistate route-to-market plan ready for legalization and has leveraged Constellation's distributor relationships to fuel their U.S. non-THC business with more opportunities in a world post federal permissibility. Overall, we're comfortable with Canopy's progress, and we're looking forward to the growth and legalization prospects for the business. 
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our main takeaways for this quarter. First, continued strong demand for our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers led by the #1 share gainer in the beer category, Modelo Especial, which we feel has ample runway for growth well into the future, given the steadily increasing household penetration rates among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity. The short-term supply disruption to our imported beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects as we expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end, and we're on track to deliver a better-than-expected year for our beer business. 
Second, we continue to see the hard seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector within the beer market. Going forward, we plan to focus on competing in this space in ways where we can offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers, and we have some upcoming innovation in this space that we're optimistic about. 
Number three, we continue to see benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy take hold. We're performing well in the higher end of the wine segment, and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success, such as e-commerce and DTC. 
Fourth, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, disciplined and consumer-led approach focused on high-growth segments aligned with consumer trends to complement our organic growth while developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business at margin-accretive price points. 
And fifth, and certainly not least, our shareholder value equation continues to be based on outsized growth combined with the return of dollars to shareholders. And let me reiterate, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We remain committed to our goal of returning $5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year '23 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong operational performance and cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in Q2 aligned with our commitment, which contributed to the increase in our EPS guidance for the year. 
At the same time, we remain committed to continuing to reinvest in our business with an emphasis on our beer business to keep up with the robust demand for our products. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth?"

Q2 certainly reflected yet another strong quarter of marketplace performance for our beer business. Due to continued robust consumer demand for our core beer portfolio, we now expect to exceed our initial top line and operating income targets for our beer business. Additionally, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to continue to repurchase shares during the quarter. And through September, we've repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $1.4 billion. As a result, we've increased our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target, and we now expect to be in the range of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity and earnings impact and reflects the increase in beer operating income guidance and decrease in the average -- in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding based on shares repurchased through September partially offset by an increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2022. 
Now let's review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of nearly 12% and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 7%, driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on-premise channel. Depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 driven by out-of-stocks due to ongoing robust consumer demand as well as lost shipping days for some of our distributors due to severe weather events, including hurricanes and wildfires. We estimate that these factors hampered Q2 growth by approximately 2 to 3 points. 
As Bill mentioned, on-premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the quarter and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre COVID and accounted for only 6% of our depletion volume in Q2 fiscal 2021 as a result of the on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. 
Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will also be flat in Q3. Wholesaler depletions continued to outpace cases shipped during Q2, resulting in a lower-than-normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter. To rectify this gap, shipment case volume is expected to exceed depletion case volume throughout the second half of the fiscal year, resulting in a gradual improvement of distributor inventories during Q3 and Q4 as inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin decreased 530 basis points versus prior year to 37.2%. Benefits from favorable pricing, mix and foreign currency were more than offset by unfavorable COGS, increased marketing investments and higher SG&A. 
The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that include the following: First, a Q2 obsolescence charge of $66 million. As a result of our production constraints earlier in the year, we prebuilt hard seltzer inventory in advance of the key summer selling season based on our best estimates for fiscal year 2022. Due to the overall slowdown in the hard seltzer category in the U.S., some of that growth is not going to materialize in the fiscal year, resulting in excess inventory. Second, increased brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased headcount and incremental spend related to capacity expansion. Third, a step-up in depreciation expense, largely due to the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon. And finally, as expected, increased material costs predominantly driven by increased commodity prices and inflationary headwinds on pallets, cartons and aluminum. These COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption. 
Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 150 basis points to 9.9 versus prior year as we returned to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Lastly, the increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $12 million in legal expenses as well as higher compensation and benefits. 
As mentioned earlier, we are increasing full year fiscal 2022 net sales and operating income guidance for our beer business. We are now targeting net sales growth of 9% to 11%, reflecting the strength of our core beer portfolio and pricing actions that are higher than initially planned. Furthermore, we are now targeting operating income growth of 4% to 6%, which implies operating margin in the low to midpoint of our stated 39% to 40% range. Please note that the updated guidance includes all obsolescence charges and legal expenses incurred in the first half of the fiscal year. 
We continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by several cost headwinds. However, the mix and magnitude of these headwinds have changed from our original assumptions presented at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
First, we're still estimating a significant step-up in depreciation expense, which began to accelerate in Q2. However, some of this depreciation started later in the year versus planned. As such, we are now estimating total beer depreciation expense to approximately $250 million, an increase of approximately $55 million versus last year or a $10 million decrease versus our original planned estimate. 
Second, we still expect  substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components to continue during the second half of our fiscal year as commodity prices continue to rise, specifically across aluminum, diesel and pallets resulting from a rather volatile inflationary market. 
And third, due to the growth moderation within the hard seltzer market as well as lower ACV levels across the category on new items, we do not expect our hard seltzer SKUs to meet originally planned volume expectations, which results in a positive mix benefit versus our original estimate. 
Conversely, due to the slowdown in the hard seltzer sector, excess inventory resulted in a fiscal year-to-date obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million. Please note that these losses cover our hard seltzer obsolescence exposure, and as such, we do not expect to take any additional obsolete charges in the back half of the fiscal year for hard seltzers. From a marketing perspective, we continue to expect full year spend as a percentage of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range, which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. 
Looking ahead to Q3. I'd like to remind everyone of the difficult buying overlaps we will encounter as we're facing a 28% and 12% growth comparison for shipment volume and depletion volume, respectively. Additionally, we expect to perform our normal annual brewery maintenance during Q3, which will result in less throughput versus Q2 as we have to shut down production for a few days. As such, we are estimating low single-digit shipment volume growth for Q3. 
Moving to wine and spirits. Q2 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 18% on shipment volume down 36%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 15%, driven by organic shipment volume growth of nearly 6%, favorable mix and price and smoke-tainted bulk wine sales. Robust mix driven by the Prisoner brand family, Meiomi and Kim Crawford accounted for approximately 9 points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth. Shipments were negatively impacted by port delays for our international brands and route-to-market changes, which also impacted depletions. Depletion volume declined 2% during the quarter and was additionally impacted by the challenging overlap to consumer pantry loading behavior especially for our mainstream brands that experienced robust growth during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we feel as though most of these challenges are behind us and expect shipment volume and depletion volume to generally align in the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 620 basis points to 19.7% as mix benefits from the existing portfolio and divestitures combined with favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend, higher COGS and margin-dilutive smoke-tainted bulk wine sales. Higher COGS were driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and increased transportation costs. The unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulted from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a frost during their harvest season earlier this year as well as decreased production levels at our wineries in California due to the 2020 U.S. wildfires. These headwinds were partially offset by lower great raw materials and other cost savings initiatives. 
Keep in mind that we're lapping lower SG&A spend in Q2 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and having smaller business post divestitures, resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging, impacting operating margins. For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25%, respectively. This implies operating margin to approximately 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine experience divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. 
From a Q3 perspective, keep in mind that we are lapping unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million in the prior year resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires. We expect this favorable overlap to be partially offset by a continued increase in transportation costs and incremental unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the New Zealand frost also, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result of the wine and spirits divestitures. As such, we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q3 fiscal 2022. 
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $117 million, up 7% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $245 million driven by increase in compensation and benefits. 
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 4% to approximately $96 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We now expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. The slight decrease versus our previous guidance reflects early redemption of higher interest rate debt as well as $1 billion of senior notes issued in July at attractive rates. Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 21.8% versus 16.9% in Q2 of last year primarily driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits and a higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 19%. This increase is primarily due to a higher effective tax rate on our foreign earnings than originally estimated. I would also note that we expect stock-based compensation tax benefits to be weighted towards Q4. As a result, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year estimate at approximately 21%. We also now expect our 2022 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 192 million, reflecting the impact of our September year-to-date share repurchases previously discussed. 
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal 2022, which is flat to prior year reflecting strong operating cash flows offset by an increase in CapEx. CapEx totaled $353 million, which included approximately $295 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million targeted for Mexican beer operation expansions, remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. 
In closing, I want to iterate that while we had our fair share of challenges during the first half of our fiscal year resulting in several puts and takes impacting our results, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and consumer demand for our products, particularly our imported beer portfolio, remains robust, providing us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

And also for the quarter, are you expecting depletions to still be above that low single-digit shipment rate that you mentioned? Or is that tough with the difficult 12% depletion comp? 
And then second, the longer-term question is you raised your revenue guidance for this year. How much of that is underlying demand strength and depletions maybe versus shipments and perhaps getting more supply in the balance of the year versus pricing? And on the pricing front, you've sounded more aggressive in terms of pricing expectations going forward publicly. A, I guess, is that correct? And b, is that more just to combat higher commodity costs? Or is it more confidence in market share gains or that the consumer environment is conducive to taking pricing here?"

So relative to depletes in September, we expect those to be fairly consistent with year-to-date trends.  We're just about all wrapped up for September, keeping in mind, that's going against the 20% increase that we had during September of last year. So that's a pretty powerful start to the quarter. We do expect that depletions are going to continue to be above shipments for the reasons that Garth noted in his remarks. So we would expect the depletions would be above it for that window of time. 
The pricing environment remains relatively strong. As we've said, we expect to be slightly ahead of our usual algorithm driven more by taking pricing on some SKUs that we had not anticipated earlier in the year more than we're doing anything unique to take additional pricing where we -- what we had already planned. Garth, anything you want to add to that?"

So I guess I'm trying to understand your level of conservatism with your new FY guidance, especially with margins given -- you mentioned there's going to be no more charges in the second half. You highlighted you plan to take incremental pricing, and then there are a few other net positive starts that you called out. So just want to make sure I'm not missing anything or maybe what's changed here."

As Bill just articulated, we're taking more -- we're taking increased pricing across more SKUs than we originally planned. So we'll be above our range there. So that's a net positive. We also have the mix benefit of seltzers and, again, a net positive there. And then the increase in core beer outlook is a net positive. So those are all the headwinds. 
But we still have -- those are all the tailwinds, but we still have the headwinds that we've been talking about all year long, right? So even though depreciation is coming in less than expected, we still have an uptick in depreciation in the second half of the year, we still are facing increase in commodity prices, including aluminum, diesel, natural gas, wood. Those will continue in the second half of the year. Now we think that the guidance we provided takes into account all of those cost increases. So we feel we have those covered. But again, I mean, we just continue to have these puts and takes, and we feel confident that -- in the margin outlook that we provided. Keep in mind, too, that even though we're going to have a mixed benefit from seltzers, we still are going to sell seltzers, and those are margin-dilutive as we've noted previously"

Bill, I know you probably don't want to provide too many details until it's in the market, but will this change the calorie or the sugar levels. So just curious on that. And then my broader question is, Modelo is clearly doing very well. We see that in the data with non-Hispanic consumers. But as we look at some of the numerator data and we look at different cohorts, what we noticed is that Corona's kind of leverage to some of these demographics that Modelo's doing much better with. You're seeing some of those numbers in periods. So just wanted to get a sense on incrementality of Modelo when you think about Model and Corona together. And do you ever think that maybe there's a different merchandising scheme you can use instead of putting both brands right next to one another to kind of reduce some of that cannibalization?"
258589,1680073154,2404523,"Constellation Brands, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2021",2021-10-06,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Sure. So relative to your first quick point, there won't be a radical change in the current formulation of our seltzer layout. Relative to Modelo and Corona.

So relative to your first quick point, there won't be a radical change in the current formulation of our seltzer layout. Relative to Modelo and Corona. Obviously, there's interaction between those 2 brands as you would expect. However, as we've said before, Nik, and I'm sure you're quite familiar, our household penetration on Modelo is still significantly below where Corona is to say nothing of it's below other brands that are -- that it competes against. 
So while it is a true statement that as Modelo grows or as corona grows, it does into some of our brands. We still see it as largely positive as we see that growth profile. And as we've talked before, Modelo, it continues to grow velocity. There's a lot -- still a lot of runway to expand distribution. The household penetration, which I touched on just a second ago remains a massive opportunity for that. And we only started advertising to the non-Hispanic community about 3.5 years ago. So we're really just getting started on Modelo and the opportunity that presents itself there. 
So while you continue to see some interaction, and clearly, I think the idea of separating those at retail to some degree has some opportunity, I think, overall, we're still focused on expanding our presence of both of those brands. As you probably saw, Corona Extra had a very good quarter. And it just shows the ongoing strength of the core Corona franchise in addition to exceptional performance by Modelo."

Corona Extra has done very well at retail as well. 
Relative to Pacifico, we continue to feel like Pacifico is another great opportunity. It's like a baby Modelo. it's developing in a very similar way to what Modelo did, say, 20 years ago with extensive growth profile on the West Coast and as it's starting to filter East. As you know, we're investing more against Pacifico than we have historically. We had a little bit of challenge in this quarter with Brown Glass, which had some impact on Pacifico during the quarter as it did with Modelo Negra as well. But those are ongoing supply chain challenges that we're working our way through. It does nothing , just slowed down what we expect to be another superb brand for us as time goes forward in Pacifico."

And as we've said, we're -- because of robust demand, we're going to continue to invest to support our business. So we would not expect to see any radical change of what our time frame is all about. Demand has been higher than expected. We need to create some redundancy in our system. As we've noted on prior calls, and a brewery in the Southeast will be an integral part of that strategy"

And at the risk of saying yes, no, yes, no, and yes, no, it's largely dependent on where you were geographically and what was going on in particular markets. So while we would sit here and say state X is coming up and we're seeing more on-premise, if you saw a wave of COVID challenges in another market, you saw stuff go the other way. So what that basically -- I think there wasn't an overarching answer to that question. It was really on a localized basis that you saw many of the movements within the quarter. 
Again, in the aggregate, on-premise was better than it was in the prior year, and it continues to be increasing as a percentage of our business, but it's still not quite where it was before the pandemic. So hopefully, that helps. It's very hard to  give a real aggregate of the thing because it's really made up of a lot of individual answers rather than something being an overarching trend across the marketplace. 
I think relative to your question about cross category, you can -- I think the overarching thing that you see there is the premiumization trends continue, whether you think about it in  ready-to-drink and our ABAs. You continue to see people premiumizing. You see it in the wine business, where the higher end of the wine business continues to outperform the mainstream sector of the business and you continue to see that in spirit. So I think that is an overarching trend that you see. You also see what we found for many years now, which is consumers are more interested in having an array of beverages depending on the exact occasion in which they are consuming product and are less likely than they used to be to consume only one type of product at any one occasion than what was perhaps the case historically. So I hope that helps."

Bill, just picking up on the last question, but really kind of lasering in, I guess, a little bit on wine and broadly for the industry because there's been some discussion in the marketplace about the recent slowdown, and it's not limited to the on-premise and we've seen the Nielsen data. So your point is extremely well taken. The premiumization trends are still in place, obviously, broad-based across total beverage alcohol. But even on a 2-year average basis, this is -- we're seeing the trend slow down here. 
So I'm not sure how much more you can add to your comment previously. Do you view this as transient at this point, some of this deceleration we're seeing in the category? Is there a bigger, maybe more difficult to quantify dynamic going on around ready-to-drink beverages in a way there hasn't been with wine before, if you could comment on that? 
And Garth, just sort of a cleanup, but I think important, the 30% operating margin target in the wine segment, is that still the target? And is fiscal '24, so over the next couple of years, is that sort of enough of a time line to take out the stranded overhead? So your comments there would be helpful."

Those are rough -- for us, 3 to 4x what it was in 2019. And you're seeing that as sort of 3% to 5% of our business today, where it was 1% before. So some of what you're seeing in that is a difference in the way the consumer actually acquires, and it may or may not be reflective of some of the IRI/Nielsen data because it's not picked up in those channels. Some of it is with 3-tier e-commerce. But certainly, the direct-to-consumer channel is not. 
So you've got some of that dynamic in play. And of course, almost all of that tends to the higher end. That's where that consumer purchasing behavior occurs. So I do think there's ebbs and flows on all of those things. I think you saw probably more consumption behavior at home during COVID. So you're probably seeing a little bit of more challenging comparable versus prior year. So I think as we get hopefully back to a bit more normalcy, I think you'll continue to see what the long-term trend is, which is that the higher end of the business continues to outperform and then it's a strong growth play for that sector.

I think we were probably a bit on the conservative end compared to some of the competition as to what they expected going into this year where some of them were predicting in excess of 50% growth. We projected less. But even as it was, we were. So that is the fundamental issue. 
When you combine that with the fact that we preproduced which, again, at the time was about production scheduling and, in our judgment, was the right thing to do at the time, that in hindsight did not work out for us as well either. But you got to keep in mind, despite all that, if it's a relatively small percentage of our overall growth profile, it is additive to our growth. It is not the majority of our growth. The majority of our growth continues to be the robust demand against our core beer portfolio, and that's where we expect it to continue to be. 
So now relative to the formulation, we've just -- we obviously do a lot of consumer research, and we track consumer perspectives. And we have found that consumers are desiring a bit more flavor and a bit more differentiation within their sell-through preferences, and we plan to address those consumer needs."

On the pricing question, what we said on that was that our typical pricing algorithm has us gaining 1 to 2 percentage points per year given the pricing environment that we're in this year, we're able to be a little bit more aggressive on products that we wouldn't otherwise take pricing on.

Relative to our desire in the seltzer/ABA space, there's a number of things. First of all, we're going to focus our attention on where we think we bring differentiated products that are distinct. Given what we have today, I would use Refresca and Limonada as 2 examples of that need specific needs and are not what I would describe as [ need-to ] products. We also have, as we noted in our scripts, some innovation agenda items that we think are going to be distinctive and will bring unique value to the table as well.

We still think that the overall ABA space is going to be a growth category. Whether or not the seltzer subsegment of the beer category is going -- how much of that is going to be driven by the seltzer subsegment remains to be seen. Quite frankly, it clearly is going to be a lot less than what everyone anticipated coming into this year. But again, for us, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall play. So we are not entirely reliant on success in the seltzer category. In fact, we expect to achieve our algorithm through our core beer business. 
Relative to the question of will this put a damper on our growth in the beer business, if Seltzer is challenging, not really. I mean the fact that we were able to raise our guidance is largely driven by the fact that we're able to make more beer. And we're able to make more beer because we're making a little less seltzer and that is margin-accretive and it's a very high-growth category. So I realize there's a bad side and a good side to that answer, but the reality is it's not inconsistent with what we've always seen, which is our core business portfolio of beer from Mexico continues to radically outperform the industry, and we continue to be the leader in the high end and the high-end growth. 
So is it going to be any different going forward? I think a little bit remains to be seen. We're going to have a little bit more of a watch-and-see effort than we had before. I think everyone got a little bit excited about seltzer. And frankly, the category has slowed significantly. So I think we will probably do a much better job of being guarded in terms of our expectation around that while continuing to leverage our outstanding portfolio of core beer brands"

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. Let's dive right into a discussion about the quarter. There were a number of puts and takes impacting our results in Q2, and Garth and I will spend time walking through them. However,",2519,"Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter call. Let's dive right into a discussion about the quarter. There were a number of puts and takes impacting our results in Q2, and Garth and I will spend time walking through them. However, the fundamentals of our business remain solid, and consumer demand for our brands, particularly our core beer portfolio, remains strong. This gives us confidence to increase our EPS guidance for the year, which we outlined in our press release earlier today and Garth will review in more detail shortly.  
In addition, we repurchased a significant number of shares in Q2 at prices that are favorable as we believe Constellation stock is undervalued at current levels. We've received some feedback from investors on this topic in recent weeks, and we'll address key themes that emerge from these discussions in our remarks.  
As we walk through our Q2 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, there are several key takeaways we'd ask you to keep in mind. Number one, the momentum of our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers as we're the leading share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer market. The majority of our growth continues to be driven by Modelo Especial, supported by strong consumer demand for Corona Extra and Pacifico, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that Modelo Especial in particular has a long runway for growth, given the steadily increasing household penetration for this brand among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity.  
Now we've admittedly had some supply challenges this fiscal year driven by several external factors, the most relevant being the ongoing robust demand for our beer brands. We expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4. Despite these challenges, we continue to be on track to deliver a better-than-expected year for our beer business. In fact, our strong performance to date gives us the confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 9% to 11% net sales growth and 4% to 6% operating income growth for fiscal '22. Our view is reinforced by recent 12-week IRI trends showing the Constellation's beer business is significantly outpacing the high end and total U.S. beer industry.  
Point two. As it relates to our hard seltzer business and building off our last point, we're unique in our position versus our competitors in this space as our primary growth is coming from our core beer portfolio, and we're not reliant on the growth of hard seltzers and ABAs to achieve the medium-term growth goals for our beer business. The hard seltzer landscape has shifted considerably in recent months. Therefore, we've lowered our growth expectations for Corona Hard Seltzer, resulting in a sizable obsolescence charge taken for Q2, which includes our view of the total impact for the fiscal year.  
So let's be clear, we continue to see the hard seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector in the beer market, and we continue to believe it's important to participate in and gain our fair share in this segment to complement the growth of our core imported beer portfolio and to maintain our position as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Going forward, we plan to focus on competing in this space where we offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers. I'll have more to say on this topic in a moment.  
Number three, while our wine and spirits business was challenged in the quarter by underperformance of several mainstream brands due to tough COVID comparisons, our recent route-to-market transition and supply chain challenges for our imported wine brands, we continue to see the benefits of our premiumization strategy take hold. We're performing well in the high end of the wine segment, which represents the vast majority of expected industry growth over the next several years, and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success such as e-commerce and DTC.  
Number four, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, strategic, disciplined and consumer-led approach with a focus on high-growth segments aligned with consumer trends. Our innovation agenda is designed to complement our organic growth, and we're developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business while further premiumizing our portfolio into margin-accretive price points.  
Over the years, we've been able to extend some of our brands into new spaces, recruiting new drinkers and expanding occasions, and we've achieved a healthy balance between growth from the core and from innovation.  
Number five, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged since I assumed the role of CEO almost 3 years ago. Since then, we've made significant progress in reducing debt and achieving our goal of returning $5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year '23 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In fact, to date, this fiscal year, we have repurchased 1.4 billion of our shares. And when combined with our dividend, we have achieved nearly 60% of our 5 billion goal.  
To be clear, our shareholder value equation is based on outsized growth combined with return of dollars to shareholders. One of the most important capital allocation priorities is to continue reinvesting in our beer business to keep up with robust demand for our products. Despite initial challenges associated with the build-out of a third brewery in Mexico, we have moved on to other capacity alternatives in the country. Our expansions in Nava and Obregon helped ensure we have adequate production capacity for the medium term and will create much needed redundant capacity that better enables us to manage through unexpected events like we've experienced these past 2 years. We continue to work with the Mexican government to solidify plans for a new brewery in Southeastern Mexico with adequate water supply and an available talented workforce.  
Now let's move on to a more fulsome discussion about our performance within the quarter. During the quarter, the Modelo brand family posted depletion growth of 17% for the quarter and single-handedly drove total import share gains in IRI channels on a dollar basis. As the #2 beer brand in dollar sales in the entire U.S. beer category, Modelo Especial is the only major beer brand growing household penetration and is leading the way as the #1 share gainer among high-end brands. Modelo Chelada has become the #2 brand family in the Chelada space, posting depletion growth of more than 50% for the second quarter.  
Corona Extra continues its growth trajectory as the second fastest share gainer and the #1 loved brand in the import category driven by a return to growth in the on-premise, which currently represents approximately 11% of our beer business volume.  
In addition to the comments I made earlier about our hard seltzers, I'd like to discuss industry trends and our refreshed approach to this sector of the beer market going forward. In the short to medium term, we believe that there will be consolidation within the hard seltzer/ABA space primarily due to the chaos of SKU and brand proliferation with too many new entrants that don't have the velocity or consumer demand to warrant shelf space. We also believe this subcategory will evolve beyond low-calorie, low-carb offerings and open up to more distinctive consumer value propositions that include things like more flavor, different alcohol bases and functional benefits.  
We've already started to innovate in this way with distinct products like Refresca and Limonada. We've also discovered that consumers are looking for more robust taste and flavor in their seltzers. As a result, we will be altering the flavor and taste profile of our seltzer portfolio to better align with the changing consumer preferences while also introducing single-serve packages to better serve the growing convenience channel, our largest trade channel. And we have a solid lineup of innovation that we have yet to introduce.  
We have several great examples of our innovation strategy at work within our wine and spirits portfolio. This business continues to drive growth from recently launched innovations, including Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate, the Prisoner Cabernet and Chardonnay, all of which are amongst the top 10 innovations across high-end wine in IRI channels during the quarter. And our wine and spirits innovation pipeline is ready to go with further consumer-led new products as we head into our peak selling period, including the expansion of our SVEDKA ready-to-drink platform and the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzers and box wines.  
In addition to driving growth through innovation, we're making progress with our core wine and spirits portfolio despite the previously mentioned challenges. We continue to take price to further premiumize our mainstream portfolio as these steps are critical to maintain brand equity and to improve profitability, which will serve our brands well over the long term.  
We're putting points on the board in a number of areas where we're outperforming the U.S. wine market. Our high-end super premium plus portfolio grew net sales double digits during the quarter. In on-premise channels, our investments are paying off with enhanced wine offerings at major restaurant chains. We're driving in critical emerging channels like 3-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, which continued to drive high-end growth, where we're outpacing category performance at key accounts such as Instacart, Amazon and Albertsons with the resurgence of online shopping due to the COVID pandemic.  
For example, Constellation's fine wine share has expanded significantly in the latest 12 weeks due to the robust growth of the Prisoner on Instacart and Robert Mondavi Winery on wine.com. In fact, e-commerce and DTC sales are up nearly 3 to 4x versus 2019, and they comprise roughly 3% to 5% of our business versus 1% pre-pandemic. Going forward, we will continue to focus on becoming a category leader in e-commerce and DTC as we believe these channels will make up a significant portion of our mix over time and will continue to be an opportunity for high-end growth.  
I'd also like to provide you an update on our U.S. harvest, which is about 70% complete at this point, while our production facilities, wineries and tasting rooms remain untouched by recent wildfire activity. This quarter, our ventures activities included investments in adaptogen-infused HOP WTR and Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston's artisanal Dos Hombres Mezcal. HOP WTR is a nonalcoholic, calorie-free sparkling water, infused with adaptogens and new tropics to provide the perfect balance of function and flavor for health-conscious consumers. The nonalcoholic segment of total beverage alcohol grew almost 40% in 2020 in dollar sales through IRI channels. And according to IWSR research, 60% of consumers are switching between nonalcoholic or low-alcoholic and full strength drinks within the same occasion.  
Dos Hombres is an award-winning handcrafted mezcal brand created by Breaking Bad co-stars who have developed an exceptional liquid that receives frequent praise from both the industry and consumers. The overall U.S. mezcal category grew 14% in 2020 according to IWSR, and super premium mezcal priced above $30 per barrel is projected to be the largest and fastest-growing segment within the category.  
Moving on to Canopy growth. We're encouraged by the recent introduction of the cannabis opportunity in administration draft bill, which was introduced by Senators Booker, Wyden and Schumer in July. More than 90% of Americans are in favor of cannabis legislation for medical purposes, and 2/3 of those are in favor of legalizing for recreational use as well. In fact, nearly 2 out of 3 Americans already have legal cannabis access as 37 states have legalized for medical use and 18 states for adult use.  
While we're optimistic about federal legislation within this congress, Canopy is not waiting for this reality to materialize. Canopy's U.S. business grew 91% year-over-year in their most recent quarter driven by robust consumer demand for their CBD and CPG products, including Martha Stewart-branded products, Quatreau beverages, stores and vape products and BioSteel's new RTDs.  
Over the coming years, revenue for Canopy's U.S. business is expected to grow significantly as it benefits from increasing distribution and new product introductions. Once THC permissibility becomes a reality in the U.S., Canopy expects their U.S. business to make a substantially greater contribution to their results.  
Canopy has scaled a multistate route-to-market plan ready for legalization and has leveraged Constellation's distributor relationships to fuel their U.S. non-THC business with more opportunities in a world post federal permissibility. Overall, we're comfortable with Canopy's progress, and we're looking forward to the growth and legalization prospects for the business.  
In closing, I'd like to reiterate our main takeaways for this quarter. First, continued strong demand for our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers, led by the #1 share gainer in the beer category, Modelo Especial, which we feel has ample runway for growth well into the future, given the steadily increasing household penetration rates among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity. The short-term supply disruption to our imported beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects as we expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4, and we're on track to deliver a better-than-expected year for our beer business.  
Second, we continue to see the hard seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector within the beer market. Going forward, we plan to focus on competing in this space in ways where we can offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers, and we have some upcoming innovation in the space that we're optimistic about.  
Number three, we continue to see benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy take hold. We're performing well in the higher end of the wine segment, and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success, such as e-commerce and DTC.  
Fourth, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, disciplined and consumer-led approach focused on high-growth segments aligned with consumer trends to complement our organic growth while developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business at margin-accretive price points.  
And fifth, and certainly not least, our shareholder value equation continues to be based on outsized growth combined with the return of dollars to shareholders. And let me reiterate, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We remain committed to our goal of returning $5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year '23 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong operational performance and cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in Q2 aligned with our commitment, which contributed to the increase in our EPS guidance for the year. At the same time, we remain committed to continuing to reinvest in our business with an emphasis on our beer business to keep up with the robust demand for our products. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth?"

Q2 certainly reflected yet another strong quarter of marketplace performance for our beer business. Due to continued robust consumer demand for our core beer portfolio, we now expect to exceed our initial top line and operating income targets for our beer business. Additionally, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to continue to repurchase shares during the quarter. And through September, we've repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $1.4 billion. As a result, we've increased our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target, and we now expect to be in the range of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity and earnings impact and reflects the increase in beer operating income guidance and decrease in the average -- in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding based on shares repurchased through September, partially offset by an increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2022. 
Now let's review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of nearly 12% and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 7%, driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on-premise channel. Depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 driven by out-of-stocks due to ongoing robust consumer demand as well as lost shipping days for some of our distributors due to severe weather events, including hurricanes and wildfires. We estimate that these factors hampered Q2 growth by approximately 2 to 3 points. 
As Bill mentioned, on-premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the quarter and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 6% of our depletion volume in Q2 fiscal 2021 as a result of the on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. 
Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will also be flat in Q3. Wholesaler depletions continued to outpace cases shipped during Q2, resulting in a lower-than-normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter. To rectify this gap, shipment case volume is expected to exceed depletion case volume throughout the second half of the fiscal year, resulting in a gradual improvement of distributor inventories during Q3 and Q4 as inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year. 
Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin decreased 530 basis points versus prior year to 37.2%. Benefits from favorable pricing, mix and foreign currency were more than offset by unfavorable COGS, increased marketing investments and higher SG&A. 
The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that include the following: First, a Q2 obsolescence charge of $66 million. As a result of our production constraints earlier in the year, we prebuilt hard seltzer inventory in advance of the key summer selling season based on our best estimates for fiscal year 2022. Due to the overall slowdown in the hard seltzer category in the U.S., some of that growth is not going to materialize in the fiscal year, resulting in excess inventory. Second, increased brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased head count and incremental spend related to capacity expansion. Third, a step-up in depreciation expense, largely due to the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon. And finally, as expected, increased material costs predominantly driven by increased commodity prices and inflationary headwinds on pallets, cartons and aluminum. These COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption. 
Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 150 basis points to 9.9 versus prior year as we returned to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Lastly, the increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $12 million in legal expenses as well as higher compensation and benefits. 
As mentioned earlier, we are increasing full year fiscal 2022 net sales and operating income guidance for our beer business. We are now targeting net sales growth of 9% to 11%, reflecting the strength of our core beer portfolio and pricing actions that are higher than initially planned. Furthermore, we are now targeting operating income growth of 4% to 6%, which implies operating margin in the low to midpoint of our stated 39% to 40% range. Please note that the updated guidance includes all obsolescence charges and legal expenses incurred in the first half of the fiscal year. 
We continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by several cost headwinds. However, the mix and magnitude of these headwinds have changed from our original assumptions presented at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
First, we're still estimating a significant step-up in depreciation expense, which began to accelerate in Q2. However, some of this depreciation started later in the year versus planned. As such, we are now estimating total beer depreciation expense to approximately $250 million, an increase of approximately $55 million versus last year or a $10 million decrease versus our original planned estimate. 
Second, we still expect substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components to continue during the second half of our fiscal year as commodity prices continue to rise, specifically across aluminum, diesel and pallets resulting from a rather volatile inflationary market. 
And third, due to the growth moderation within the hard seltzer market as well as lower ACV levels across the category on new items, we do not expect our hard seltzer SKUs to meet originally planned volume expectations, which results in a positive mix benefit versus our original estimate. 
Conversely, due to the slowdown in the hard seltzer sector, excess inventory resulted in a fiscal year-to-date obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million. Please note that these losses cover our hard seltzer obsolescence exposure. And as such, we do not expect to take any additional obsolete charges in the back half of the fiscal year for hard seltzers. From a marketing perspective, we continue to expect full year spend as a percentage of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range, which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. 
Looking ahead to Q3. I'd like to remind everyone of the difficult buying overlaps we will encounter as we're facing a 28% and 12% growth comparison for shipment volume and depletion volume, respectively. Additionally, we expect to perform our normal annual brewery maintenance during Q3, which will result in less throughput versus Q2 as we have to shut down production for a few days. As such, we are estimating low single-digit shipment volume growth for Q3. 
Moving to wine and spirits. Q2 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 18% on shipment volume down to 36%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 15% driven by organic shipment volume growth of nearly 6%, favorable mix and price and smoke-tainted bulk wine sales. Robust mix driven by the Prisoner brand family, Meiomi and Kim Crawford accounted for approximately 9 points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth. Shipments were negatively impacted by port delays for our international brands and route-to-market changes, which also impacted depletions. Depletion volume declined 2% during the quarter and was additionally impacted by the challenging overlap to consumer pantry loading behavior, especially for our mainstream brands that experienced robust growth during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we feel as though most of these challenges are behind us and expect shipment volume and depletion volume to generally align in the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 620 basis points to 19.7% as mix benefits from the existing portfolio and divestitures combined with favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend, higher COGS and margin-dilutive smoke-tainted bulk wine sales. Higher COGS were driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and increased transportation costs. The unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulted from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a frost during their harvest season earlier this year as well as decreased production levels at our wineries in California due to the 2020 U.S. wildfires. These headwinds were partially offset by lower great raw materials and other cost savings initiatives. 
Keep in mind that we're lapping lower SG&A spend in Q2 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and heavy smaller business post-divestitures, resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging, impacting operating margins. For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25%, respectively. This implies operating margin to approximately 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine experience divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. 
From a Q3 perspective, keep in mind that we are lapping unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million in the prior year resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires. We expect this favorable overlap to be partially offset by a continued increase in transportation costs and incremental unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the New Zealand frost. Also, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result of the wine and spirits divestitures. As such, we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q3 fiscal 2022. 
Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $117 million, up 7% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $245 million driven by increase in compensation and benefits. 
Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 4% to approximately $96 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We now expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. The slight decrease versus our previous guidance reflects early redemption of higher interest rate debt as well as $1 billion of senior notes issued in July at attractive rates. 
Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 21.8% versus 16.9% in Q2 of last year primarily driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits and a higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 19%. This increase is primarily due to a higher effective tax rate on our foreign earnings than originally estimated. I would also note that we expect stock-based compensation tax benefits to be weighted towards Q4. As a result, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year estimate at approximately 21%. We also now expect our 2022 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 192 million, reflecting the impact of our September year-to-date share repurchases previously discussed. 
Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal 2022, which is flat to prior year, reflecting strong operating cash flows offset by an increase in CapEx. CapEx totaled $353 million, which included approximately $295 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million targeted for Mexican beer operation expansions, remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. 
In closing, I want to iterate that while we had our fair share of challenges during the first half of our fiscal year resulting in several puts and takes impacting our results, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and consumer demand for our products, particularly our imported beer portfolio, remains robust, providing us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

I just -- in thinking through it and thinking about the midpoint of your new beer guidance for the full year, this does imply a pretty big step down in the second half. For instance, your new guidance implies around 4%, 4.5% beer shipment volume growth, 3% of income growth and then beer margins of 39% for the second half, and that compares to your beer margins of 40% in the first half, which did include the $80 million obsolescence charge that you called out. 
So I guess I'm trying to understand your level of conservatism with your new FY guidance, especially with margins given -- you mentioned there's going to be no more charges in the second half. You highlighted you plan to take incremental pricing, and then there are a few other net positive starts that you called out. So just want to make sure I'm not missing anything or maybe what's changed here."

And as you noted, we've got some headwinds and we've got some tailwinds, right? And so just on the tailwinds. Obviously, as we said in my opening remarks, we've got a bit of a benefit on depreciation just starting later than expected in the year, and so that's a net positive. As Bill just articulated, we're taking more -- we're taking increased pricing across more SKUs than we originally planned. So we'll be above our range there. So that's a net positive. We also have the mix benefit of seltzers and, again, a net positive there. And then the increase in core beer outlook is a net positive. So those are all the headwinds. 
But we still have -- those are all the tailwinds, but we still have the headwinds that we've been talking about all year long, right? So even though depreciation is coming in less than expected, we still have an uptick in depreciation in the second half of the year. We still are facing increase in commodity prices, including aluminum, diesel, natural gas, wood. Those will continue in the second half of the year. Now we think that the guidance we provided takes into account all of those cost increases. So we feel we have those covered. But again, I mean, we just continue to have these puts and takes, and we feel confident that -- in the margin outlook that we provided. 
Keep in mind, too, that even though we're going to have a mixed benefit from seltzers, we still are going to sell seltzers, and those are margin-dilutive as we've noted previously."

Bill, I know you probably don't want to provide too many details until it's in the market, but will this change the calorie or the sugar levels? So just curious on that. And then my broader question is, Modelo is clearly doing very well. We see that in the data with non-Hispanic consumers. But as we look at some of the numerator data and we look at different cohorts, what we noticed is that Corona's kind of leveraged to some of these demographics that Modelo's doing much better with. You're seeing some of those numbers deteriorate. So just wanted to get a sense on incrementality of Modelo when you think about Modelo and Corona together. And do you ever think that maybe there's a different merchandising scheme you can use instead of putting both brands right next to one another to kind of reduce some of that cannibalization?"

So relative to your first quick point, there won't be a radical change in the current formulation of our seltzer layout. Relative to Modelo and Corona, obviously, there's interaction between those 2 brands as you would expect. However, as we've said before, Nik, and I'm sure you're quite familiar, our household penetration on Modelo is still significantly below where Corona is to say nothing of it's below other brands that are -- that it competes against. 
So while it is a true statement that as Modelo grows or as corona grows, it does into some of our brands. We still see it as largely positive as we see that growth profile. And as we've talked before, Modelo, it continues to grow velocity. There's a lot -- still a lot of runway to expand distribution. The household penetration, which I touched on just a second ago remains a massive opportunity for that. And we only started advertising to the non-Hispanic community about 3.5 years ago. So we're really just getting started on Modelo and the opportunity that presents itself there. 
So while you continue to see some interaction, and clearly, I think the idea of separating those at retail to some degree has some opportunity, I think, overall, we're still focused on expanding our presence of both of those brands. As you probably saw, Corona Extra had a very good quarter. And it just shows the ongoing strength of the core Corona franchise in addition to exceptional performance by Modelo."

So probably 50%, give or take, of the growth profile that we saw in Corona Extra is the reopening of the on-premise. As we've said in prior calls, we were down as low as 3% of our business a few quarters ago during the sort of the peak of the initial COVID pandemic issue. That's now up to 11%. And clearly, with the Corona being one of the most loved brands that exist in the category, the increase that you would expect to see as on-premise opens has been important. But don't underestimate. Corona Extra has done very well at retail as well. 
Relative to Pacifico, we continue to feel like Pacifico is another great opportunity. It's like a baby Modelo. It's developing in a very similar way to what Modelo did, say, 20 years ago with extensive growth profile on the West Coast and as it's starting to filter East. As you know, we're investing more against Pacifico than we have historically. We had a little bit of challenge in this quarter with brown glass, which had some impact on Pacifico during the quarter as it did with Modelo Negra as well. But those are ongoing supply chain challenges that we're working our way through. It does nothing, nothing, just slowed down what we expect to be another superb brand for us as time goes forward in Pacifico."

That's still an important initiative for us because, as Bill outlined in his prepared remarks, while the seltzer category has slowed, the ABA segment within beer continues to be a dynamic and meaningful part of the high end and it's one that we need to compete in. And by having dedicated ABA capacity, that frees up capacity for our core Mexican beer portfolio. So that goes on as planned. 
And then furthermore, on the investment that you referenced in the first part of your -- in your question, we did indicate that we were going to spend $60 million this fiscal year behind Corona Hard Seltzer.

And at the risk of saying yes, no, yes, no and yes, no, it's largely dependent on where you were geographically and what was going on in particular markets. So while we would sit here and say state X is coming up and we're seeing more on-premise, if you saw a wave of COVID challenges in another market, you saw stuff go the other way. So what that basically -- I think there wasn't an overarching answer to that question. It was really on a localized basis that you saw many of the movements within the quarter. 
Again, in the aggregate, on-premise was better than it was in the prior year, and it continues to be increasing as a percentage of our business, but it's still not quite where it was before the pandemic. So hopefully, that helps. It's very hard to give a real aggregate of the thing because it's really made up of a lot of individual answers rather than something being an overarching trend across the marketplace. 
I think relative to your question about cross-category, you can -- I think the overarching thing that you see there is the premiumization trends continue. Whether you think about it in  ready-to-drink and our ABAs, you continue to see people premiumizing. You see it in the wine business, where the higher end of the wine business continues to outperform the mainstream sector of the business and you continue to see that in spirit. So I think that is an overarching trend that you see. 
You also see what we found for many years now, which is consumers are more interested in having an array of beverages depending on the exact occasion in which they are consuming product and are less likely than they used to be to consume only one type of product at any one occasion than what was perhaps the case historically. So I hope that helps."

Bill, just picking up on the last question, but really kind of lasering in, I guess, a little bit on wine and broadly for the industry because there's been some discussion in the marketplace about the recent slowdown, and it's not limited to the on-premise and we've seen the Nielsen data. So your point is extremely well taken. The premiumization trends are still in place, obviously, broad-based across total beverage alcohol. But even on a 2-year average basis, this is -- we're seeing the trend slow down here. 
So I'm not sure how much more you can add to your comment previously. Do you view this as transient at this point, some of this deceleration we're seeing in the category? Is there a bigger, maybe a bit more difficult to quantify dynamic going on around ready-to-drink beverages in a way there hasn't been with wine before, if you could comment on that? 
And Garth, just sort of a cleanup, but I think important. The 30% operating margin target in the wine segment, is that still the target? And is fiscal '24, so over the next couple of years, is that sort of enough of a time line to take out the stranded overhead? So your comments there would be helpful."

So some of what you're seeing in that is a difference in the way the consumer actually acquires, and it may or may not be reflective of some of the IRI/Nielsen data because it's not picked up in those channels. Some of it is with 3-tier e-commerce. But certainly, the direct-to-consumer channel is not. 
So you've got some of that dynamic in play. And of course, almost all of that tends to the higher end. That's where that consumer purchasing behavior occurs. So I do think there's ebbs and flows on all of those things. I think you saw probably more consumption behavior at home during COVID. So you're probably seeing a little bit of more challenging comparable versus prior year. So I think as we get hopefully back to a bit more normalcy, I think you'll continue to see what the long-term trend is, which is that the higher end of the business continues to outperform and then it's a strong growth play for that sector.

When you combine that with the fact that we pre-produced which, again, at the time was about production scheduling and, in our judgment, was the right thing to do at the time, that in hindsight did not work out for us as well either. But you got to keep in mind, despite all that, if it's a relatively small percentage of our overall growth profile, it is additive to our growth. It is not the majority of our growth. The majority of our growth continues to be the robust demand against our core beer portfolio, and that's where we expect it to continue to be. 
So now relative to the formulation, we've just -- we obviously do a lot of consumer research, and we track consumer perspectives.

You said depletion should outpace the low single-digit shipments you guided in the 3Q, which would imply a sequential acceleration in 3Q from the 12% on a 2-year stack that you achieved in the second quarter. So given that you're facing tougher comparisons, if you grew depletion the same amount about 12% in the third quarter of last year, is that acceleration on the 2-year coming mostly from on-premise and at-home decelerating but still growing? Is that the way we should be thinking? In other words, should we think about the depletion growing around mid-single digit when you said -- I think you said it emphatically that the third quarter depletions would outpace shipments as well? 
And then related to -- and just a clarification on the pricing front, should we think that you will have about 2% price/mix realization already in the 3Q. And what are you seeing elasticities playing out so far?"

So just on Q3 shipments and depletions, what we said in terms of -- from a growth perspective, shipments will grow in the low single digits and depletions will grow higher than that. We furthermore said that on a volume basis, depletions -- shipments would outpace depletions and, therefore, we've made progress in returning inventory to more normal levels by the end of our fiscal year. 
On the pricing question, what we said on that was that our typical pricing algorithm has us gaining 1 to 2 percentage points per year. Given the pricing environment that we're in this year, we're able to be a little bit more aggressive on products that we wouldn't otherwise take pricing on. And so we're going to take pricing on those SKUs. And as a result, we'll be slightly above our 2% this year."

So first, what is the growth you are envisaging for the category? And really I'm interested in the rationale behind it and thinking about the next, let's say, a year or so. 
And then as you mentioned, there will be a consolidation with the elimination of lower velocity SKU. Do you see a risk potentially for the Corona seltzer -- I mean the white can as you -- as that SKU has been significantly underperforming the category? So do you see a risk here that you could lose ACV? And finally, how are you planning to gain the fair share of the seltzer category, especially as Mexican brand, I mean Topo Chico is really becoming more national beginning of next year and also launching a margarita-flavored, more flavor than the SKU? So I'd like to understand how you play that."

If I understood the first part of your question correctly, I mean keep in mind that the beer category has been roughly flat at a time when we are up roughly 8%. So there is a significant delta between what the overall category is performing and what we are performing. We're radically outperforming the category. 
Relative to our desire in the seltzer/ABA space, there's a number of things. First of all, we're going to focus our attention on where we think we bring differentiated products that are distinct. Given what we have today, I would use Refresca and Limonada as 2 examples of that, that meet specific needs and are not what I would describe as need-to products. 
We also have, as we noted in our scripts, some innovation agenda items that we think are going to be distinctive and will bring unique value to the table as well. So we continue to believe this is going to be an additive portion of our growth but certainly not the largest portion of our growth. That will continue to be our core beer portfolio."

I mean 2 quarters ago, like you said, we have a lot of market research. You and everybody else was very bold up about the market, and it seems like it was a soft summer, but it didn't seem like the category was a fad or it's over. But in kind of redirecting marketing and advertising and moving to kind of focused SKUs, it seems that is what you're kind of seeing. So I guess is that what you're seeing? I mean do you see this as kind of a small niche permanently? Or do you -- and everybody was kind of wrong, that it was going to be a bigger place? Or is this just a pause for the category? 
And then the second question is with you redirecting kind of advertising marketing towards your core beer portfolio, does that result in the -- I know it's small but seltzers falling off a cliff over the next 2 quarters and creating kind of headwinds for your growth on beer?"

Relative to the category, our view of it is this. We still think that the overall ABA space is going to be a growth category.

We still think that the overall ABA space is going to be a growth category. Whether or not the seltzer subsegment of the beer category is going -- how much of that is going to be driven by the seltzer subsegment remains to be seen. Quite frankly, it clearly is going to be a lot less than what everyone anticipated coming into this year. But again, for us, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall play. So we are not entirely reliant on success in the seltzer category. In fact, we expect to achieve our algorithm through our core beer business. 
Relative to the question of will this put a damper on our growth in the beer business if Seltzer is challenging, not really. I mean the fact that we were able to raise our guidance is largely driven by the fact that we're able to make more beer. And we're able to make more beer because we're making a little less seltzer, and that is margin-accretive and it's a very high-growth category. 
So I realize there's a bad side and a good side to that answer, but the reality is it's not inconsistent with what we've always seen, which is our core business portfolio of beer from Mexico continues to radically outperform the industry, and we continue to be the leader in the high end and the high-end growth. 
So is it going to be any different going forward? I think a little bit remains to be seen. We're going to have a little bit more of a watch-and-see effort than we had before. I think everyone got a little bit excited about seltzer. And frankly, the category has slowed significantly. So I think we will probably do a much better job of being guarded in terms of our expectation around that while continuing to leverage our outstanding portfolio of core beer brands."
