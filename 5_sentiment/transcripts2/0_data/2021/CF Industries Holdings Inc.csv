Before I jump into our financial results, I want to highlight the entire CF team for amazing execution across all areas of our business. We set all-time company best records for safety, ammonia production and sales volumes despite the challenges the 2020 hurl at us. There was no playbook for how to manage through a global pandemic. Yet this team developed and implemented plans to keep our people safe, along with everyone who came on to our sites. 
To date, we have no known transmissions of COVID-19 within any of our facilities. On the safety front, we ended the year with only 4 recordable injuries and 0 lost time injuries across the entire network for the whole year. As is typically the case, safe operations are also more productive. And we proved that again with an all-time ammonia production record of 10.4 million tons. 
Our sales and logistics team rose to the challenge and set all-time sales and shipping records of over 20 million product tons. Truly a remarkable performance by all. Thank you for the great work and keep it up. Turning now to our 2020 financial results, which we posted yesterday afternoon. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.35 billion, also terrific performance. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about 2021. 
As Bert will describe in a moment, the global nitrogen pricing outlook is much more positive than a year ago, with strong commodity crop prices and significantly higher energy prices in Asia and Europe, we are seeing a robust demand environment, coupled with a steeper global cost curve. The current conditions in the Southern Plains in Midwest have thrown another crisis at us but as usual, the team has done a fantastic job responding to and navigating through these new challenges. We have been able to quickly adjust our plant operations based on close communications with our gas suppliers. 
Disruptions have been widespread across the U.S. nitrogen industry, and this should result in further tightening of nitrogen supply for the spring planting season in North America. Additional support for an already strong 2021. Longer term, we're pleased with the progress we are making on our commitment to the clean energy economy. We continue to advance discussions with technology providers and partners, and we have seen new opportunities developed since our announcement. 
These underscore help broad the demand for green and low-carbon ammonia will be and also the value of our unique capabilities. With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

Global nitrogen dynamics today with low-cost producers like CF are the most positive they've been since 2014. Strong demand driven by high commodity crop prices and a steeper global cost curve are creating a tighter nitrogen supply and demand balance. As a result, prices have risen significantly in recent months and are well above 2020 values. Global demand is robust and broad based. Farmers in North America have seen nitrogen consuming course grains reach multiyear highs for both near-term and futures contracts. For corn, we have seen lower-than-expected supply and high global demand led by China. As a result, the USDA is projecting that the corn stocks use ratio for the marketing year will be at its lowest level since 2013. 
This supports our projection of 90 million to 92 million planting corn acres in the U.S. this year with upside potential. Through the balance of the year, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil. We expect urea tender volumes in India this year will be well above the 5-year average and close to the 10 million metric tons of last year. 
For Brazil, we project 2021 imports of urea to be approximately 6.5 million to 7 million metric tons, similar to last year. As demand was increasing, the cost curve steepen significantly. From July 2020 to July -- to December 2020, the Dutch TTF natural gas price and the Asian JKM LNG price both increased about 5x greater than the U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price. This had a number of impacts. First, margin opportunities increased for low cost producers; second, the significant increase in energy prices for producers in Europe and Asia pressured their margins, not only leading to lower operating rates but creating demand for import ammonia into those regions. 
This contributed an even tighter global market. Over time, we expect our global nitrogen market to tighten further and faster, driven by several factors. In the near term, the need to rebuild the stock of commodity crops will underpin demand growth. Longer term, a key driver will be emerging demand for ammonia for clean energy applications. 
We believe this level of global demand will require more production from the highest cost plants until prices rise enough to incent greenfield construction in other parts of the world. We are well positioned as we approach the spring application season and have the flexibility necessary to address any challenges that arise. We believe that the recent weather conditions in the U.S. are a disruption that we built our system to overcome. We're looking forward to working with our customers and leveraging our optionality to ensure that these requirements are met as they make -- as our customers make their final preparations for spring. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share. EBITDA $1.32 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion.

For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share. EBITDA $1.32 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was approximately $750 million. These results reflect year-over-year global nitrogen, lower lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower natural gas and SG&A costs compared to the year before. 
The results also demonstrate our continued efficient conversion of EBITDA into free cash. As you can see on Slide 9, we converted more than 55% of our adjusted EBITDA into free cash in 2020, which is the highest rate among our peers. Our pre-cash conversion continues to support our capital structure and allocation priorities. As we noted in the press release, we have decided to repay early the $250 million remaining on our senior secured notes that are due in December. This will lower our gross debt to $3.75 billion as we remain focused on investment grade, and positioning the company to execute our clean energy growth strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce gross debt over time. 
We remain excited to invest in the clean energy growth opportunities given the expected return profile. We will also continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic repurchases at attractive levels. As we look ahead to 2021, I want to share some of our expectations for the year ahead. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2021 will be in the range of $450 million. 
This reflects a return to a normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities in the year ahead and the first expenses associated with the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville. We also expect SG&A levels to return to a level closer to 2019 than 2020. Our annual cash interest expense will fall to $175 million with the repayment of the 2021 notes. With our planned maintenance schedule and recent gas-driven curtailments, we expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million to 10 million tons. 
This, along with lower inventories for the start of the year, will likely result in lower product tons sold than in 2020. As we indicated in the press release, we believe overall sales volume will be between 19 million and 19.5 million product tons. Additionally, based on forward curves, we project our natural gas costs will be somewhat higher in 2021 than in 2020. However, we expect margins to improve this year, given the positive nitrogen pricing outlook that Bert described. 
As you can see on Slide 12, increases in our realized urea price have a much greater impact on EBITDA than higher realized natural gas costs. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

We feel very positive about the year ahead. As Bert described, nitrogen industry dynamics for producers in North America are the most favorable we have seen in nearly a decade. And longer term, the developing demand for ammonia in clean energy applications provides exciting growth prospects for us, where we are uniquely positioned to be a global leader, providing clean energy for a better world. 
Economies will continue to focus on decarbonization and hydrogen will be a key solution with ammonia a critical enabler of hydrogen as a clean fuel.

But this year, it does seem like a lot of the suppliers are indicating they're sold out through at least mid-April and longer, in some cases, due to global demand elsewhere, which should present, let's say, looking more stability, if not an opportunity for U.S. inland prices throughout spring. So just what are your broad thoughts on the different dynamics emerging in '21 versus, let's say, the past few seasons?"

And good question because that has been an issue in the past with overwhelming, sometimes a positive market. And then we see a correction in April, May or June, and some of those corrections can be pretty wicked like we saw last year, which I would say was more COVID related than a risk-off timing, not necessarily as much of a supply situation but that has been and has happened. 
But today, I think we're in a different market. I don't see those extra cargoes coming. Our imports are running below last year's levels. You also have to look at supply. There's been a number of turnarounds that have taken place in that region and others that have taken tons off-line. And then when you look at the gas costs that have increased as related to North America and Europe and Asia and other places, that incremental ton that may have come online or may have been operating probably is not. So those 3 factors plus increased demand in India and Brazil with Brazil taking additional cargoes in January and February has soaked up a lot of that supply. 
And we still have Turkey and Thailand and a few other countries that are short and will need supply as well as Europe. So as we approach spring planting, which were only probably 6 weeks away, the likelihood of getting that extra cargo in line, offloaded. And depending on river froze -- the rivers that are frozen today, falling and the snow that we're experiencing today on the speed of that thaw and river levels and the ability to get those tons into the Midwest, that window is closing very quickly. 
That is why we are so focused right now with this situation on gas and production of making sure we have adequate supply for our customers, positioned in the right place at the right time to make sure that the supply is there."

So we're actually working with and trying to support and rally others to develop similar kinds of programs and solutions because I think it will benefit us in the long term.

In terms of our interest and willingness to participate in projects outside of kind of the 4 walls of what our current network is. 
I think we're always evaluating opportunities for growing the business as long as the return profile looks attractive.

I think the much larger impact is that given the COVID situation last year, we were trying to minimize exposure to our folks by reducing the number of contractors that we had come on our sites. And so anything that we could defer in the way of turnaround activity or scheduled maintenance, we tried to push. 
And so we ended up with higher utilization of our assets because we we did have a couple of very significant turnarounds that we either dramatically reduce the scope of or pushed entirely into 2021. And so that was part of what helps at an all-time ammonia production record. So as we look at 2021, we not only have the normal slate of turnaround activity, but also the things that were deferred from last year. So that is by far the largest contributing factor to the reduction in tons available for sale this year. As you're aware, we run the plants 24/7/365. And so if you're -- we, over the course of the year, pretty much produce what we -- or sell what we produce and sell in a year that has more turnaround activity, there's just less production available. 
There's a little bit of impact in terms of starting the year at a lower inventory position than we were last year, but that's the small end of the stick, not the large."

And what we're projecting now or today for acreage amongst the nitrogen consuming crops, it's going to be high, and I would say, higher with probably additional applications for yield just due to the price -- the attractive price structure that is available to farmers today. So we're anticipating a very healthy spring. I think also you have to remember, we have been in a COVID environment, and our focus has been on the safety well-being of our employees, but also making sure our customers receive their product on time as well as making sure we can move that product. And so as we were looking to the spring into Q1, with the projected polar vortex, which was projected to come, we took the prudent action of moving additional tones out in December.

And then we got to this week where our own gas situations. And so we did gather as a group. We did the benefit of our team, I think, is we're small, and we've been together for a number of years, and we worked very well together. 
And we could ascertain and communicate very quickly what was going on and make some decisions around the plants and around what we were going to do with our gas positions, but it's still an evolving situation with what plants are down, what plants are operating and when they will come up. But I think you hit the nail on the head is the impact. And so we've been trying to run those numbers, both internal and external, and that's not too difficult to do. 
And there have been a number of plants that have been on turnaround that have extended those turnarounds unrelated to gas. And so the lost production tonnage on an ammonia basis is probably several hundred thousand tons. And then when you take that to upgrades, you're probably at many several hundred thousand tons. But we're still in this situation. It is still very cold and Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. And these plants, if they were not shut down appropriately, will not come up appropriately. 
And I think that's where you have -- can have some confidence with CF and our production team and a shout out to them of how we manage that process and communicate and do it safely.

We've got a huge kind of operational flexibility and the plants for us, anyway, that we're impacted by this weather have been our Oklahoma plants principally, which are -- which tend to be more UAN driven. 
So the purchases of of urea that Bert talked about not only provide cover there, but gives us a lot of flexibility to think about running diesel at a higher UAN mix maybe than we have in the past in order to backfill for us anyway, any kind of disruptions. But I agree with Bert. I think none of the plan to now in that area will have steam tracing or other kinds of cold weather protections in place. And you could see disruptions from some of those plants that could extend weeks or months. So the tightening of North American supply could be noticeable in terms of outages as a result of the weather."

And would be curious to hear your view on which of those various end markets would you see as likely having the most potential, whether it's ammonia as a fuel blend for ships or as a fuel blend in power production? Curious how those discussions with prospective customers are going. And given your electrolyzers won't be on stream for a couple more years, do you see it as likely that you will have sales of either gray or blue ammonia to those customers in the interim?"

So I actually think that we will likely be producing what we're calling blue ammonia, which is ammonia that we produce by conventional means where then the result in CO2 is captured and sequestered before we produce our first ton of green ammo",367,"Yes, Steve. So I actually think that we will likely be producing what we're calling blue ammonia, which is ammonia that we produce by conventional means where then the result in CO2 is captured and sequestered before we produce our first ton of green ammonia because I think we're not that far away from being able to produce blue ammonia through carbon sequestration. And I do think -- one of the things that we've talked a lot about, both at the Hydrogen Council and also within hydrogen forward is the notion of transition and improvement and so using gray ammonia or conventional ammonia as a way to get momentum toward reducing overall carbon emissions is significant. 
And then as you transition gray ammonia to blue and green, you get further benefits. So I absolutely believe that some of these applications, including use in power plants, we'll begin with conventionally produced ammonia or gray ammonia transition quickly to blue and then ultimately end up in green. But I don't really think that there is kind of one sector where we're putting all of our chips. I firmly believe that hydrogen is going to represent a significant portion of the energy deck across many, many industries, including some very hard to abate industries like transportation and heavy industry. 
And in those applications, in particular, ammonia plays a really, I think, a starring role. But you've seen announcements just this week from Maersk and others. So initial applications are very much going to be, I think, utility and energy use, shipping and transportation fuel. And we're also getting a lot of interest in terms of low-carbon inputs into the farm because we are a big believer as are many people that carbon sequestration and the soil is going to be available to growers. 
And if you have a lower carbon input, there is significant value there for the farmers. And so when we can produce blue ammonia for basically the same cost structure is conventional, that provides real value to a farmer. So I think we're going to see demand for these products, not only in industrial and transportation, utility areas, but also in our traditional core market of agriculture."

So we would expect there to be further support and helping to develop and augment this industry. And frankly, the other piece that will really, I think, be strong support for development and implementation of hydrogen and as a fuel is going to be if we put in place a cap and trade or a carbon tax more of the stick side of the equation as opposed to the carrot side. 
Because I think the minute you start providing not only economic incentives for people to shift, but real pain, if they don't, you'll see a much quicker migration. So we're very hopeful with the new administration that there can be a firm commitment around putting in place a real cost of carbon because I think that, that just accelerates the adoption and movement towards hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia."

What we see, again, with high cost gas, Asia peaked probably in the low 20s, has since fallen back to $6 to $7. One, they're going -- if they're going to operate those gas and coal plants and coal is also at a higher level, it needs to be at these levels. So we have seen them position but small amounts right now. We don't see them aggressively pursuing export tonnage, where if you go back several years, when they were overwhelming the market, they were exporting over 1 million tons, December, January, February, that's going to be denim this year. 
And so that further supports what we've been saying about the supply demand balance. We're projecting that China will be in that similar range around 5 million tons. And it will be interesting for this -- in the tender that we expect in the next few weeks to see what level of participation they will have, but they're bidding [ 4 ] exports today at a fairly aggressively high level."

So I think what I would attribute it to is there's a couple of things, one of which is culture so we have very much a culture in our facilities of not only as I talked about during my prepared remarks, safe operations, but that also translates into very productive and efficient operations. And part of that means at the first sign of any issues, we go ahead and take plants down. And do preventative maintenance or maintenance on them as opposed to run until they break and then try to fix them, which break-fix is a poor operating model in these kind of plants. 
We've also deployed a lot of predictive technology and algorithms to help us identify issues well before they begin, whether it's bearing vibrations or small changes in heat profiles. And so what we'll end up doing is, for instance, taking the back end of a plant down going it off a bit, keeping the front end hot, making some minor maintenance fixes and then getting back into the loop without losing significant production, but it allows us to hit the kind of numbers that you see here on Page 6 of our materials. 
I think the other thing that plays into it is the scale, given the number of ammonia plants that we have that are of similar vintage, we're able to maintain a very efficient spare parts pool that we can move back and forth very quickly between our facilities and get terrific leverage out of. And I think, honestly, we can attract terrific talent and have some expertise, whether it's in rotating equipment or in other kinds of areas that is pretty unique to us. 
So I think it's a combination of all of those things that ultimately drive the significant difference in capacity utilization and asset utilization. You see on Page 6. And I think those things absolutely are leverageable and can be transferable to other assets. One of the things we've seen with the Terra plants that were acquired back in 2010 is that they did take a while to -- for us to invest in maintenance procedures, change culture, get the right approach from an operations standpoint, but they're producing every bit as efficiently now as the historical Medicine Hat and Donaldsonville CF plants were so I think it absolutely is transferable, scalable and a real value prop that we bring. 
It's not overnight. There's a fair bit of investment in order to change culture and so forth. But I do think that that's one of the things that we look at when we're evaluating synergy potential, which is what kind of asset utilization could we ultimately expect to get out of some new equipment as opposed to how it has historically been running."

And while I wouldn't a priority take anything off the table, if it's something we can do and do well and bring value to, we'll consider it. One of the first things that we're really focused on today is helping to develop a set of standards worldwide that I think allow for the adoption and migration into hydrogen and clean ammonia because they've done poorly or improperly that could really be a deterrent for the development of these technologies. 
And so we're working very hard with a number of different organizations to make sure that the right kind of standards and approaches are adopted."

And now we're seeing them stepping in and buying incremental ethanol, which just is helping the system, at least our system operate more efficiently and move product around. 
So with the trebling of the hog herd that needed to take place after the Asian swine flu, swept through China and decimated the production of pork. You're seeing a rebuilding take place, and they drew down there in the probably last several years, drew down that stockpile that was there, we weren't never sure, but we believe that, that was drawn down to a very low level. So that -- those 2 coupled together, accelerated demand for U.S. corn, which was just kind of fuel to the fire for the U.S. system. 
And we do see that continuing into and through 2021 and beyond it. The corn yields in China are not as healthy as United States or other places in the world. And the price level of being able to import corn from the U.S. or Brazil is still very profitable for the Chinese trading houses and processing groups. So on an economic basis, it will continue.

I think it's low-cost from the standpoint of variable or operating costs from a gas supply standpoint. But there are significant capital cost challenges with constructing new facilities in North America. And at some levels of capital, it doesn't matter whether the gas is free or better off building the plant someplace else. 
So the place where new capacity is currently being added are the regions that I would expect kind of the next round to continue to see additions. So you're talking Nigeria, Iran, Russia, those are places both with plenty of supply of natural gas, where you can do contracted LSTK, kind of construction and if you can bite off the political risk, I think that's where you will likely see the new construction happening. 
But we would expect pricing needs to be kind of $300-plus for a full year to really provide that sort of incentive and depending upon leverage rates and so forth, maybe a little bit lower than that. But at $300 ammonia based on what construction costs are in North America, you just can't make that math work. So again, I think you're going to see additions, other places before you see it here."

That, coupled with what's happening in Trinidad and some places in Asia, building a plant and operating it these are long-lived assets and they should be able like ours operate 30, 40, 50 years.

Before I jump into our financial results, I want to highlight the entire CF team for amazing execution across all areas of our business. We set all-time company best records for safety, ammonia production and sales volumes despite the challenges the 2020 hurled at us. 
There was no playbook for how to manage through a global pandemic. Yet this team developed and implemented plans to keep our people safe, along with everyone who came on to our sites.
To date, we have no known transmissions of COVID-19 within any of our facilities. On the safety front, we ended the year with only 4 recordable injuries and 0 lost time injuries across the entire network for the whole year. As is typically the case, safe operations are also more productive. And we proved that again with an all-time ammonia production record of 10.4 million tons.
Our sales and logistics team rose to the challenge and set all-time sales and shipping records of over 20 million product tons. Truly a remarkable performance by all. Thank you for the great work and keep it up. 
Turning now to our 2020 financial results, which we posted yesterday afternoon. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.35 billion, also terrific performance. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about 2021.
As Bert will describe in a moment, the global nitrogen pricing outlook is much more positive than a year ago, with strong commodity crop prices and significantly higher energy prices in Asia and Europe, we are seeing a robust demand environment, coupled with a steeper global cost curve. 
The current conditions in the Southern Plains and Midwest have thrown another crisis at us, but as usual, the team has done a fantastic job responding to and navigating through these new challenges. We have been able to quickly adjust our plant operations based on close communications with our gas suppliers.
Disruptions have been widespread across the U.S. nitrogen industry, and this should result in further tightening of nitrogen supply for the spring planting season in North America. Additional support for an already strong 2021. 
Longer term, we're pleased with the progress we are making on our Commitment to the Clean Energy Economy. We continue to advance discussions with technology providers and partners, and we have seen new opportunities developed since our announcement.
These underscore help broad the demand for green and low-carbon ammonia will be, and also the value of our unique capabilities. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

Global nitrogen dynamics today with low-cost producers like CF are the most positive they've been since 2014. Strong demand, driven by high commodity crop prices and a steeper global cost curve are creating a tighter nitrogen supply and demand balance. As a result, prices have risen significantly in recent months and are well above 2020 values. Global demand is robust and broad-based. Farmers in North America have seen nitrogen consuming course grains reach multiyear highs for both near-term and future's contracts. For corn, we have seen lower-than-expected supply and high global demand led by China. As a result, the USDA is projecting that the corn stocks use ratio for the marketing year will be at its lowest level since 2013.
This supports our projection of 90 million to 92 million planting corn acres in the U.S. this year with upside potential. Through the balance of the year, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil. We expect urea tender volumes in India, this year, will be well above the 5-year average and close to the 10 million metric tons of last year.
For Brazil, we project 2021 imports of urea to be approximately 6.5 million to 7 million metric tons, similar to last year. 
As demand was increasing, the cost curve steepened significantly. From July 2020 to July -- to December 2020, the Dutch TTF natural gas price and the Asian JKM LNG price both increased about 5x greater than the U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price. 
This had a number of impacts: first, margin opportunities increased for low cost producers; second, the significant increase in energy prices for producers in Europe and Asia pressured their margins, not only leading to lower operating rates but creating demand for import ammonia into those regions. This contributed an even tighter global market. 
Over time, we expect our global nitrogen market to tighten further and faster, driven by several factors. In the near term, the need to rebuild the stock of commodity crops will underpin demand growth. Longer term, a key driver will be emerging demand for ammonia for clean energy applications.
We believe this level of global demand will require more production from the highest cost plants until prices rise enough to incent greenfield construction in other parts of the world. We are well positioned as we approach the spring application season and have the flexibility necessary to address any challenges that arise. 
We believe that the recent weather conditions in the U.S. are a disruption that we built our system to overcome. We're looking forward to working with our customers and leveraging our optionality to ensure that these requirements are met as they make -- as our customers make their final preparations for spring.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.32 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 b",473,"Thanks, Bert. For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.32 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was approximately $750 million. These results reflect year-over-year global nitrogen -- lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower natural gas and SG&A cost compared to the year before.
The results also demonstrate our continued efficient conversion of EBITDA into free cash. As you can see on Slide 9, we converted more than 55% of our adjusted EBITDA into free cash in 2020, which is the highest rate among our peers. Our pre-cash conversion continues to support our capital structure and allocation priorities. 
As we noted in the press release, we have decided to repay early, the $250 million remaining on our senior secured notes that are due in December. This will lower our gross debt to $3.75 billion as we remain focused on investment grade, and positioning the company to execute our clean energy growth strategy. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce gross debt, overtime.
We remain excited to invest in the clean energy growth opportunity, given the expected return profile. We will also continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic repurchases at attractive levels. As we look ahead to 2021, I want to share some of our expectations for the year ahead. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2021 will be in the range of $450 million.
This reflects a return to a normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities in the year ahead and the first expenses associated with the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville. We also expect SG&A levels to return to a level closer to 2019 than 2020. Our annual cash interest expense will fall to $175 million with the repayment of the 2021 notes. With our planned maintenance schedule and recent gas-driven curtailments, we expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million to 10 million tons.
This, along with lower inventories to start the year, will likely result in lower product tons sold than in 2020. As we indicated in the press release, we believe overall sales volume will be between 19 million and 19.5 million product tons. 
Additionally, based on forward curves, we project our natural gas cost will be somewhat higher in 2021 than in 2020. However, we expect margins to improve this year, given the positive nitrogen pricing outlook that Bert described.
As you can see on Slide 12, increases in our realized urea price have a much greater impact on EBITDA than higher realized natural gas cost. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to, again, thank everyone at CF for a tremendous 2020.

We feel very positive about the year ahead. As Bert described, nitrogen industry dynamics for producers in North America are the most favorable we have seen in nearly a decade. And longer term, the developing demand for ammonia in clean energy applications provides exciting growth prospects for us, where we are uniquely positioned to be a global leader, providing clean energy for a better world.
Economies will continue to focus on decarbonization and hydrogen will be a key solution with ammonia, a critical enabler of hydrogen as a clean fuel.

But over the past few seasons, especially in '16 and '19, there's was a tendency of ammonia producers to send a few extra cargoes to NOLA, which at times is a bit disruptive to U.S. prices even mid-planting.

suppliers are indicating they're sold out through, at least, mid-April and longer, in some cases, due to global demand elsewhere, which should present, let's say, a -- let's say more stability, if not an opportunity for U.S. inland prices throughout spring. 
So just what are your broad thoughts on the different dynamics emerging in '21 versus, let's say, the past few seasons?"

And good question because that has been an issue in the past with overwhelming, sometimes a positive market. And then we see a correction in April, May or June, and some of those corrections can be pretty wicked like we saw last year, which I would say was more COVID-related than a risk-off timing, not necessarily as much of a supply situation, but that has been and has happened.
But today, I think we're in a different market. I don't see those extra cargos coming. Our imports are running below last year's levels. You also have to look at supply. There's been a number of turnarounds that have taken place in that region and in others that have taken tons offline. 
And then when you look at the gas costs that have increased as related to North America and Europe and Asia and other places, that incremental ton that may have come online or may have been operating probably is not. So those 3 factors plus increased demand in India and Brazil, with Brazil taking additional cargoes in January, February has soaked up a lot of that supply.
And we still have Turkey and Thailand and a few other countries that are short and will need supply as well as Europe. 
So as we approach spring planting, which we're only probably 6 weeks away, the likelihood of getting that extra cargo in line, offloaded, and depending on river froze -- the rivers that are frozen today, falling and the snow that we're experiencing today on the speed of that thaw and river levels and the ability to get those tons into the Midwest, that window is closing very quickly.
That is why we are so focused right now with this situation on gas and production of making sure we have adequate supply for our customers, positioned in the right place at the right time to make sure that the supply is there."

So we're actually working with and trying to support and rally others to develop similar kinds of programs and solutions because I think it will benefit us in the long term. 
And we're really focused on developing standards and trying to get some movement across policy decisions that are being made, all of which can support demand for hydrogen going forward. In terms of our interest and willingness to participate in projects outside of kind of the 4 walls of what our current network is, I think we're always evaluating opportunities for growing the business as long as the return profile looks attractive.

I think the much larger impact is that given the COVID situation last year, we were trying to minimize exposure to our folks by reducing the number of contractors that we had come on our sites. And so anything that we could defer in the way of turnaround activity or scheduled maintenance, we tried to push.
And so we ended up with higher utilization of our assets because we did have a couple of very significant turnarounds that we either dramatically reduce the scope of, or pushed entirely into 2021. And so that was part of what helps at an all-time ammonia production record. 
So as we look at 2021, we not only have the normal slate of turnaround activity, but also the things that were deferred from last year. So that is, by far, the largest contributing factor to the reduction in tons available for sale this year. As you're aware, we run the plants 24/7, 365. And so if you're -- we, over the course of the year, pretty much produce what we -- or sell what we produce and sell in a year that has more turnaround activity, there's just less production available.
There's a little bit of impact in terms of starting the year at a lower inventory position than we were last year, but that's the small end of the stick, not the large."

And what we're projecting now or today for acreage amongst the nitrogen consuming crops, it's going to be high, and I would say, higher with probably additional application for yield just due to the price -- the attractive price structure that is available to farmers today. 
So we're anticipating a very healthy spring. I think also you have to remember, we have been in a COVID environment, and our focus has been on the safety, well-being of our employees, but also making sure our customers receive their product on time as well as making sure we can move that product. 
And so as we were looking to the spring into Q1, with the projected polar vortex, which was projected to come, we took the prudent action of moving additional tones out in December. But as Tony said, we'll be well prepared for spring and have that supply available and anticipate a pretty healthy spring."

And then we got to this week where our own gas situations. And so we did gather as a group. We did -- the benefit of our team, I think, is we're small, and we've been together for a number of years, and we worked very well together.
And we could ascertain and communicate very quickly what was going on and make some decisions around the plants and around what we were going to do with our gas positions, but it's still an evolving situation with what plants are down, what plants are operating and when they will come up. But I think you hit the nail on the head is the impact. And so we've been trying to run those numbers, both internal and external, and that's not too difficult to do.
And there have been a number of plants that have been on turnaround, that have extended those turnarounds, unrelated to gas. And so the lost production tonnage on an ammonia basis is probably several hundred thousand tons. And then when you take that to upgrades, you're probably at many several hundred thousand tons. But we're still in this situation. It is still very cold in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. And these plants, if they were not shut down appropriately, will not come up appropriately.
And I think that's where you have -- can have some confidence with CF and our production team and a shout out to them of how we manage that process and communicate and do it safely. But we have been also purchased urea. So when all this came together, there was, again, back to taking care of our customers and meeting our commitments. We have been active in the market and buying an appropriate amount of tonnage to make sure we're ready once things open up again."

So the purchases of of urea, that Bert talked about, not only provide cover there, but gives us a lot of flexibility to think about running diesel at a higher UAN mix maybe than we have in the past in order to backfill for us anyway, any kind of disruptions. 
But I agree with Bert. I think none of the plants in that area will have steam tracing or other kinds of cold weather protections in place. And you could see disruptions from some of those plants that could extend weeks or months. So the tightening of North American supply could be noticeable in terms of outages as a result of the weather."

Curious how those discussions with prospective customers are going. And given your electrolyzers won't be on stream for a couple more years, do you see it as likely that you will have sales of either gray or blue ammonia to those customers in the interim?"

So I actually think that we will likely be producing what we're calling blue ammonia, which is ammonia that we produce by conventional means where then the result in CO2 is captured and sequestered before we produce our first ton of green ammo",367,"Yes, Steve. So I actually think that we will likely be producing what we're calling blue ammonia, which is ammonia that we produce by conventional means where then the result in CO2 is captured and sequestered before we produce our first ton of green ammonia because I think we're not that far away from being able to produce blue ammonia through carbon sequestration. 
And I do think -- one of the things that we've talked a lot about, both at the Hydrogen Council and also within Hydrogen Forward is the notion of transition and improvement. And so using gray ammonia or conventional ammonia as a way to get momentum toward reducing overall carbon emissions is significant.
And then as you transition gray ammonia to blue and green, you get further benefits. So I absolutely believe that some of these applications, including use in power plants, will begin with conventionally produced ammonia or gray ammonia transition quickly to blue and then ultimately end up in green. 
But I don't really think that there is kind of one sector where we're putting all of our chips. I firmly believe that hydrogen is going to represent a significant portion of the energy deck across many, many industries, including some very hard to abate industries like transportation and heavy industry.
And in those applications, in particular, ammonia plays a really, I think, a starring role. But you've seen announcements just this week from Maersk and others. So initial applications are very much going to be, I think, utility and energy use, shipping and transportation fuel. And we're also getting a lot of interest in terms of low-carbon inputs into the farm because we are a big believer, as are many people, that carbon sequestration and the soil is going to be available to growers.
And if you have a lower carbon input, there is significant value there for the farmers. And so when we can produce blue ammonia for basically the same cost structure as conventional, that provides real value to a farmer. So I think we're going to see demand for these products, not only in industrial and transportation, utility areas, but also in our traditional core market of agriculture."

There's also some dollars that are being freed up for R&D funds. But a lot of the subsidies that existed for solar and wind are not in place to the same extent yet for hydrogen.
So we would expect there to be further support and helping to develop and augment this industry. And frankly, the other piece that will really, I think, be strong support for development and implementation of hydrogen and as a fuel, is going to be if we put in place a cap and trade or a carbon tax more of the stick side of the equation as opposed to the carrot side.
Because I think the minute you start providing, not only economic incentives for people to shift, but real pain, if they don't, you'll see a much quicker migration. So we're very hopeful with the new administration that there can be a firm commitment around putting in place a real cost of carbon because I think that, that just accelerates the adoption and movement towards hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia."

What we see, again, with high cost gas, Asia peaked to probably in the low 20s, has since fallen back to $6 to $7. One, they're going -- if they're going to operate those gas and coal plants and the coal is also at a higher level, it needs to be at these levels. 
So we have seen them position, but small amounts right now. We don't see them aggressively pursuing export tonnage, where if you go back several years, when they were overwhelming the market, they were exporting over 1 million tons, December, January, February, that's going to be the minimum for this year.
And so that further supports what we've been saying about the supply demand balance. We're projecting that China will be in that similar range around 5 million tons. And it will be interesting for this India tender that we expect in the next few weeks to see what level of participation they will have, but they're bidding for exports today at a fairly aggressively high level."

So I think what I would attribute it to is there's a couple of things, one of which is culture. So we have very much a culture in our facilities of not only as I talked about during my prepared remarks, safe operations, but that also translates into very productive and efficient operations. And part of that means, at the first sign of any issues, we go ahead and take plants down. And do preventative maintenance or maintenance on them as opposed to run till they break and then try to fix them, which break/fix is a poor operating model in these kind of plants.
We've also deployed a lot of predictive technology and algorithms to help us identify issues well before they begin, whether it's bearing vibrations or small changes in heat profiles. And so what we'll end up doing is, for instance, taking the back end of a plant down cooling it off a bit, keeping the front end hot, making some minor maintenance fixes and then getting back into the loop without losing significant production, but it allows us to hit the kind of numbers that you see here on Page 6 of our materials.
I think the other thing that plays into it is the scale, given the number of ammonia plants that we have that are of similar vintage, we're able to maintain a very efficient spare parts pool that we can move back and forth very quickly between our facilities and get terrific leverage out of. And I think, honestly, we can attract terrific talent and have some expertise, whether it's in rotating equipment or in other kinds of areas that is pretty unique to us.
So I think it's a combination of all of those things that ultimately drive the significant difference in capacity utilization and asset utilization, you see on Page 6. 
And I think those things absolutely are leverageable and can be transferable to other assets. One of the things we've seen with the Terra plants that were acquired back in 2010 is that they did take a while to -- for us to invest in maintenance procedures, change culture, get the right approach from an operations standpoint, but they're producing every bit as efficiently now as the historical Medicine Hat and Donaldsonville CF plants were. So I think it absolutely is transferable, scalable and a real value prop that we bring.
It's not overnight. There's a fair bit of investment in order to change culture and so forth. But I do think that, that's one of the things that we look at when we're evaluating synergy potential, which is what kind of asset utilization could we ultimately expect to get out of some new equipment as opposed to how it has historically been running."

But I think the sort of the production, transportation, wholesale, which is the sweet spot of how we operate our business from an ag perspective, certainly fits within that framework. 
And while -- I wouldn't pay priority to take anything off the table, if it's something we can do and do well and bring value to, we'll consider it. One of the first things that we're really focused on today is helping to develop a set of standards worldwide that I think allow for the adoption and migration into hydrogen and clean ammonia because they've done poorly or improperly that could really be a deterrent for the development of these technologies.
And so we're working very hard with a number of different organizations to make sure that the right kind of standards and approaches are adopted."

And now we're seeing them stepping in and buying incremental ethanol, which just is helping the system, at least our system operate more efficiently and move product around.
So with the trebling of the hog herd that needed to take place after the Asian swine flu, swept through China and decimated the production of pork. You're seeing a rebuilding take place, and they drew down there in the, probably last several years, drew down that stockpile that was there, we weren't never sure, but we believe that, that has -- it was drawn down to a very low level. 
So that -- those 2 coupled together, accelerated demand for U.S. corn, which was just kind of fuel to the fire for the U.S. system.
And we do see that continuing into and through 2021 and beyond it. The corn yields in China are not as healthy as United States or other places in the world. And the price level of being able to import corn from the U.S. or Brazil is still very profitable for the Chinese trading houses and processing groups. So on an economic basis, it will continue.

I think it's low-cost from the standpoint of variable or operating costs from a gas supply standpoint. But there are significant capital cost challenges with constructing new facilities in North America. And at some levels of capital, it doesn't matter whether the gas is free or better off building the plant someplace else.
So the place where new capacity is currently being added are the regions that I would expect to kind of the next round to continue to see additions. 
So you're talking Nigeria, Iran, Russia, those are places, both with plenty of supply of natural gas, where you can do contracted LSTK, kind of construction. And if you can bite off the political risk, I think that's where you will likely see the new construction happening.
But we would expect pricing needs to be kind of $300-plus for a full year to really provide that sort of incentive and depending upon leverage rates and so forth, maybe a little bit lower than that. But at $300 ammonia, based on what construction costs are in North America, you just can't make that math work.

Before I jump into our financial results, I want to highlight the entire CF team for amazing execution across all areas of our business. We set all-time company best records for safety, ammonia production and sales volumes despite the challenges the 2020 hurled at us. 
There was no playbook for how to manage through a global pandemic. Yet this team developed and implemented plans to keep our people safe, along with everyone who came on to our sites.
To date, we have no known transmissions of COVID-19 within any of our facilities. On the safety front, we ended the year with only 4 recordable injuries and 0 lost time injuries across the entire network for the whole year. As is typically the case, safe operations are also more productive. And we proved that again with an all-time ammonia production record of 10.4 million tons.
Our sales and logistics team rose to the challenge and set all-time sales and shipping records of over 20 million product tons. Truly a remarkable performance by all. Thank you for the great work and keep it up. 
Turning now to our 2020 financial results, which we posted yesterday afternoon. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.35 billion, also terrific performance. Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about 2021.
As Bert will describe in a moment, the global nitrogen pricing outlook is much more positive than a year ago, with strong commodity crop prices and significantly higher energy prices in Asia and Europe, we are seeing a robust demand environment, coupled with a steeper global cost curve. 
The current conditions in the Southern Plains and Midwest have thrown another crisis at us, but as usual, the team has done a fantastic job responding to and navigating through these new challenges. We have been able to quickly adjust our plant operations based on close communications with our gas suppliers.
Disruptions have been widespread across the U.S. nitrogen industry, and this should result in further tightening of nitrogen supply for the spring planting season in North America. Additional support for an already strong 2021. 
Longer term, we're pleased with the progress we are making on our Commitment to the Clean Energy Economy. We continue to advance discussions with technology providers and partners, and we have seen new opportunities developed since our announcement.
These underscore help broad the demand for green and low-carbon ammonia will be, and also the value of our unique capabilities. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

Global nitrogen dynamics today with low-cost producers like CF are the most positive they've been since 2014. Strong demand, driven by high commodity crop prices and a steeper global cost curve are creating a tighter nitrogen supply and demand balance. As a result, prices have risen significantly in recent months and are well above 2020 values. Global demand is robust and broad-based. Farmers in North America have seen nitrogen consuming course grains reach multiyear highs for both near-term and future's contracts. For corn, we have seen lower-than-expected supply and high global demand led by China. As a result, the USDA is projecting that the corn stocks use ratio for the marketing year will be at its lowest level since 2013.
This supports our projection of 90 million to 92 million planting corn acres in the U.S. this year with upside potential. Through the balance of the year, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil. We expect urea tender volumes in India, this year, will be well above the 5-year average and close to the 10 million metric tons of last year.
For Brazil, we project 2021 imports of urea to be approximately 6.5 million to 7 million metric tons, similar to last year. 
As demand was increasing, the cost curve steepened significantly. From July 2020 to July -- to December 2020, the Dutch TTF natural gas price and the Asian JKM LNG price both increased about 5x greater than the U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price. 
This had a number of impacts: first, margin opportunities increased for low cost producers; second, the significant increase in energy prices for producers in Europe and Asia pressured their margins, not only leading to lower operating rates but creating demand for import ammonia into those regions. This contributed an even tighter global market. 
Over time, we expect our global nitrogen market to tighten further and faster, driven by several factors. In the near term, the need to rebuild the stock of commodity crops will underpin demand growth. Longer term, a key driver will be emerging demand for ammonia for clean energy applications.
We believe this level of global demand will require more production from the highest cost plants until prices rise enough to incent greenfield construction in other parts of the world. We are well positioned as we approach the spring application season and have the flexibility necessary to address any challenges that arise. 
We believe that the recent weather conditions in the U.S. are a disruption that we built our system to overcome. We're looking forward to working with our customers and leveraging our optionality to ensure that these requirements are met as they make -- as our customers make their final preparations for spring.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.32 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 b",473,"Thanks, Bert. For 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $317 million or $1.47 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.32 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was approximately $750 million. These results reflect year-over-year global nitrogen -- lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower natural gas and SG&A cost compared to the year before.
The results also demonstrate our continued efficient conversion of EBITDA into free cash. As you can see on Slide 9, we converted more than 55% of our adjusted EBITDA into free cash in 2020, which is the highest rate among our peers. Our pre-cash conversion continues to support our capital structure and allocation priorities. 
As we noted in the press release, we have decided to repay early, the $250 million remaining on our senior secured notes that are due in December. This will lower our gross debt to $3.75 billion as we remain focused on investment grade, and positioning the company to execute our clean energy growth strategy. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce gross debt, overtime.
We remain excited to invest in the clean energy growth opportunity, given the expected return profile. We will also continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic repurchases at attractive levels. As we look ahead to 2021, I want to share some of our expectations for the year ahead. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2021 will be in the range of $450 million.
This reflects a return to a normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities in the year ahead and the first expenses associated with the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville. We also expect SG&A levels to return to a level closer to 2019 than 2020. Our annual cash interest expense will fall to $175 million with the repayment of the 2021 notes. With our planned maintenance schedule and recent gas-driven curtailments, we expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million to 10 million tons.
This, along with lower inventories to start the year, will likely result in lower product tons sold than in 2020. As we indicated in the press release, we believe overall sales volume will be between 19 million and 19.5 million product tons. 
Additionally, based on forward curves, we project our natural gas cost will be somewhat higher in 2021 than in 2020. However, we expect margins to improve this year, given the positive nitrogen pricing outlook that Bert described.
As you can see on Slide 12, increases in our realized urea price have a much greater impact on EBITDA than higher realized natural gas cost. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to, again, thank everyone at CF for a tremendous 2020. Their commitment to our values and unwavering focus on safety and execution are truly the foundation of our success.
We feel very positive about the year ahead. As Bert described, nitrogen industry dynamics for producers in North America are the most favorable we have seen in nearly a decade. And longer term, the developing demand for ammonia in clean energy applications provides exciting growth prospects for us, where we are uniquely positioned to be a global leader, providing clean energy for a better world.
Economies will continue to focus on decarbonization and hydrogen will be a key solution with ammonia, a critical enabler of hydrogen as a clean fuel. 
We have seen tremendous interest in our strategic direction since our announcement last fall and see substantial opportunities ahead for clean and low-carbon ammonia.

suppliers are indicating they're sold out through, at least, mid-April and longer, in some cases, due to global demand elsewhere, which should present, let's say, a -- let's say more stability, if not an opportunity for U.S. inland prices throughout spring.

And good question because that has been an issue in the past with overwhelming, sometimes a positive market. And then we see a correction in April, May or June, and some of those corrections can be pretty wicked like we saw last year, which I would say was more COVID-related than a risk-off timing, not necessarily as much of a supply situation, but that has been and has happened.
But today, I think we're in a different market. I don't see those extra cargos coming. Our imports are running below last year's levels. You also have to look at supply. There's been a number of turnarounds that have taken place in that region and in others that have taken tons offline. 
And then when you look at the gas costs that have increased as related to North America and Europe and Asia and other places, that incremental ton that may have come online or may have been operating probably is not. So those 3 factors plus increased demand in India and Brazil, with Brazil taking additional cargoes in January, February has soaked up a lot of that supply.
And we still have Turkey and Thailand and a few other countries that are short and will need supply as well as Europe. 
So as we approach spring planting, which we're only probably 6 weeks away, the likelihood of getting that extra cargo in line, offloaded, and depending on river froze -- the rivers that are frozen today, falling and the snow that we're experiencing today on the speed of that thaw and river levels and the ability to get those tons into the Midwest, that window is closing very quickly.
That is why we are so focused right now with this situation on gas and production of making sure we have adequate supply for our customers, positioned in the right place at the right time to make sure that the supply is there."

I think the much larger impact is that given the COVID situation last year, we were trying to minimize exposure to our folks by reducing the number of contractors that we had come on our sites. And so anything that we could defer in the way of turnaround activity or scheduled maintenance, we tried to push.
And so we ended up with higher utilization of our assets because we did have a couple of very significant turnarounds that we either dramatically reduce the scope of, or pushed entirely into 2021. And so that was part of what helps at an all-time ammonia production record. 
So as we look at 2021, we not only have the normal slate of turnaround activity, but also the things that were deferred from last year. So that is, by far, the largest contributing factor to the reduction in tons available for sale this year. As you're aware, we run the plants 24/7, 365. And so if you're -- we, over the course of the year, pretty much produce what we -- or sell what we produce and sell in a year that has more turnaround activity, there's just less production available.
There's a little bit of impact in terms of starting the year at a lower inventory position than we were last year, but that's the small end of the stick, not the large."

And what we're projecting now or today for acreage amongst the nitrogen consuming crops, it's going to be high, and I would say, higher with probably additional application for yield just due to the price -- the attractive price structure that is available to farmers today. 
So we're anticipating a very healthy spring. I think also you have to remember, we have been in a COVID environment, and our focus has been on the safety, well-being of our employees, but also making sure our customers receive their product on time as well as making sure we can move that product. 
And so as we were looking to the spring into Q1, with the projected polar vortex, which was projected to come, we took the prudent action of moving additional tones out in December. But as Tony said, we'll be well prepared for spring and have that supply available and anticipate a pretty healthy spring."

And then we got to this week where our own gas situations. And so we did gather as a group. We did -- the benefit of our team, I think, is we're small, and we've been together for a number of years, and we worked very well together.
And we could ascertain and communicate very quickly what was going on and make some decisions around the plants and around what we were going to do with our gas positions, but it's still an evolving situation with what plants are down, what plants are operating and when they will come up. But I think you hit the nail on the head is the impact. And so we've been trying to run those numbers, both internal and external, and that's not too difficult to do.
And there have been a number of plants that have been on turnaround, that have extended those turnarounds, unrelated to gas. And so the lost production tonnage on an ammonia basis is probably several hundred thousand tons. And then when you take that to upgrades, you're probably at many several hundred thousand tons. But we're still in this situation. It is still very cold in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. And these plants, if they were not shut down appropriately, will not come up appropriately.
And I think that's where you have -- can have some confidence with CF and our production team and a shout out to them of how we manage that process and communicate and do it safely. But we have been also purchased urea. So when all this came together, there was, again, back to taking care of our customers and meeting our commitments. We have been active in the market and buying an appropriate amount of tonnage to make sure we're ready once things open up again."

So the purchases of of urea, that Bert talked about, not only provide cover there, but gives us a lot of flexibility to think about running diesel at a higher UAN mix maybe than we have in the past in order to backfill for us anyway, any kind of disruptions. 
But I agree with Bert. I think none of the plants in that area will have steam tracing or other kinds of cold weather protections in place. And you could see disruptions from some of those plants that could extend weeks or months. So the tightening of North American supply could be noticeable in terms of outages as a result of the weather."

Curious how those discussions with prospective customers are going.

So I actually think that we will likely be producing what we're calling blue ammonia, which is ammonia that we produce by conventional means where then the result in CO2 is captured and sequestered before we produce our first ton of green ammo",367,"Yes, Steve. So I actually think that we will likely be producing what we're calling blue ammonia, which is ammonia that we produce by conventional means where then the result in CO2 is captured and sequestered before we produce our first ton of green ammonia because I think we're not that far away from being able to produce blue ammonia through carbon sequestration. 
And I do think -- one of the things that we've talked a lot about, both at the Hydrogen Council and also within Hydrogen Forward is the notion of transition and improvement. And so using gray ammonia or conventional ammonia as a way to get momentum toward reducing overall carbon emissions is significant.
And then as you transition gray ammonia to blue and green, you get further benefits. So I absolutely believe that some of these applications, including use in power plants, will begin with conventionally produced ammonia or gray ammonia transition quickly to blue and then ultimately end up in green. 
But I don't really think that there is kind of one sector where we're putting all of our chips. I firmly believe that hydrogen is going to represent a significant portion of the energy deck across many, many industries, including some very hard to abate industries like transportation and heavy industry.
And in those applications, in particular, ammonia plays a really, I think, a starring role. But you've seen announcements just this week from Maersk and others. So initial applications are very much going to be, I think, utility and energy use, shipping and transportation fuel. And we're also getting a lot of interest in terms of low-carbon inputs into the farm because we are a big believer, as are many people, that carbon sequestration and the soil is going to be available to growers.
And if you have a lower carbon input, there is significant value there for the farmers. And so when we can produce blue ammonia for basically the same cost structure as conventional, that provides real value to a farmer. So I think we're going to see demand for these products, not only in industrial and transportation, utility areas, but also in our traditional core market of agriculture."

There's also some dollars that are being freed up for R&D funds. But a lot of the subsidies that existed for solar and wind are not in place to the same extent yet for hydrogen.
So we would expect there to be further support and helping to develop and augment this industry. And frankly, the other piece that will really, I think, be strong support for development and implementation of hydrogen and as a fuel, is going to be if we put in place a cap and trade or a carbon tax more of the stick side of the equation as opposed to the carrot side.
Because I think the minute you start providing, not only economic incentives for people to shift, but real pain, if they don't, you'll see a much quicker migration. So we're very hopeful with the new administration that there can be a firm commitment around putting in place a real cost of carbon because I think that, that just accelerates the adoption and movement towards hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia."

What we see, again, with high cost gas, Asia peaked to probably in the low 20s, has since fallen back to $6 to $7. One, they're going -- if they're going to operate those gas and coal plants and the coal is also at a higher level, it needs to be at these levels. 
So we have seen them position, but small amounts right now. We don't see them aggressively pursuing export tonnage, where if you go back several years, when they were overwhelming the market, they were exporting over 1 million tons, December, January, February, that's going to be the minimum for this year.
And so that further supports what we've been saying about the supply demand balance. We're projecting that China will be in that similar range around 5 million tons. And it will be interesting for this India tender that we expect in the next few weeks to see what level of participation they will have, but they're bidding for exports today at a fairly aggressively high level."

So I think what I would attribute it to is there's a couple of things, one of which is culture. So we have very much a culture in our facilities of not only as I talked about during my prepared remarks, safe operations, but that also translates into very productive and efficient operations. And part of that means, at the first sign of any issues, we go ahead and take plants down. And do preventative maintenance or maintenance on them as opposed to run till they break and then try to fix them, which break/fix is a poor operating model in these kind of plants.
We've also deployed a lot of predictive technology and algorithms to help us identify issues well before they begin, whether it's bearing vibrations or small changes in heat profiles. And so what we'll end up doing is, for instance, taking the back end of a plant down cooling it off a bit, keeping the front end hot, making some minor maintenance fixes and then getting back into the loop without losing significant production, but it allows us to hit the kind of numbers that you see here on Page 6 of our materials.
I think the other thing that plays into it is the scale, given the number of ammonia plants that we have that are of similar vintage, we're able to maintain a very efficient spare parts pool that we can move back and forth very quickly between our facilities and get terrific leverage out of. And I think, honestly, we can attract terrific talent and have some expertise, whether it's in rotating equipment or in other kinds of areas that is pretty unique to us.
So I think it's a combination of all of those things that ultimately drive the significant difference in capacity utilization and asset utilization, you see on Page 6. 
And I think those things absolutely are leverageable and can be transferable to other assets. One of the things we've seen with the Terra plants that were acquired back in 2010 is that they did take a while to -- for us to invest in maintenance procedures, change culture, get the right approach from an operations standpoint, but they're producing every bit as efficiently now as the historical Medicine Hat and Donaldsonville CF plants were. So I think it absolutely is transferable, scalable and a real value prop that we bring.
It's not overnight. There's a fair bit of investment in order to change culture and so forth. But I do think that, that's one of the things that we look at when we're evaluating synergy potential, which is what kind of asset utilization could we ultimately expect to get out of some new equipment as opposed to how it has historically been running."

But I think the sort of the production, transportation, wholesale, which is the sweet spot of how we operate our business from an ag perspective, certainly fits within that framework. 
And while -- I wouldn't pay priority to take anything off the table, if it's something we can do and do well and bring value to, we'll consider it. One of the first things that we're really focused on today is helping to develop a set of standards worldwide that I think allow for the adoption and migration into hydrogen and clean ammonia because they've done poorly or improperly that could really be a deterrent for the development of these technologies.
And so we're working very hard with a number of different organizations to make sure that the right kind of standards and approaches are adopted."

And now we're seeing them stepping in and buying incremental ethanol, which just is helping the system, at least our system operate more efficiently and move product around.
So with the trebling of the hog herd that needed to take place after the Asian swine flu, swept through China and decimated the production of pork. You're seeing a rebuilding take place, and they drew down there in the, probably last several years, drew down that stockpile that was there, we weren't never sure, but we believe that, that has -- it was drawn down to a very low level. 
So that -- those 2 coupled together, accelerated demand for U.S. corn, which was just kind of fuel to the fire for the U.S. system.
And we do see that continuing into and through 2021 and beyond it. The corn yields in China are not as healthy as United States or other places in the world. And the price level of being able to import corn from the U.S. or Brazil is still very profitable for the Chinese trading houses and processing groups. So on an economic basis, it will continue.

I think it's low-cost from the standpoint of variable or operating costs from a gas supply standpoint. But there are significant capital cost challenges with constructing new facilities in North America. And at some levels of capital, it doesn't matter whether the gas is free or better off building the plant someplace else.
So the place where new capacity is currently being added are the regions that I would expect to kind of the next round to continue to see additions. 
So you're talking Nigeria, Iran, Russia, those are places, both with plenty of supply of natural gas, where you can do contracted LSTK, kind of construction. And if you can bite off the political risk, I think that's where you will likely see the new construction happening.
But we would expect pricing needs to be kind of $300-plus for a full year to really provide that sort of incentive and depending upon leverage rates and so forth, maybe a little bit lower than that. But at $300 ammonia, based on what construction costs are in North America, you just can't make that math work.

That, coupled with what's happening in Trinidad and some places in Asia, building a plant and operating it, these are long-lived assets and they should be able like ours operate 30, 40, 50 years.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $398 million. These results are really the story of nitrogen prices that increased throughout the quarter, somewhat offset due to lower production and corresponding sales volumes. 
There were a lot of other things happening during the quarter, such as winter weather driving up LNG demand and corresponding gas prices, and one very large winter storm event in the U.S. But if you take all of these impacts together, they roughly offset each other. 
Let me provide a bit of color on our response to these events, but I'd like to refer you to Slide 6 and 7 in our posted materials. 
Back in February, leading into Presidents Day weekend, an extreme winter storm hit the U.S. Gas suppliers into several of our locations curtailed gas deliveries, and we were informed that we would likely force majeure hard shutdowns. Our team mobilized quickly, discussed various options and decided on the following course of action. Given we are facing the loss of gas delivery into our plants and would be shut down anyway, we opted to effectively sell the gas we had contracted for back to our suppliers by net settling our gas delivery contracts at prevailing market prices. We also reduced operating rates to minimum levels at some plants that were still receiving gas and sold the excess gas above those minimum levels back to suppliers. The result was a gain on sale of gas of $112 million. 
Slide 6 provides some details of how we mitigate gas price risk and how the February storm affected gas prices. 
However, there were pretty significant impacts to our operations as a result of the shutdowns and freeze-offs. We experienced some prolonged outages and increased maintenance expense, including fixed cost write-offs as a result of the abrupt disruption and extreme cold. And of course, gas price rose for that portion of our gas that was not hedged. Because we lost a fair bit of production, we chose to go into the market and purchase urea barges so that we could meet existing customer commitments, which also cost us a small amount. 
The net result of all of this is shown on Slide 7 of our materials. 
Net-net, our sale of gas mitigated our increased costs so we came out of it basically even. Now we did lose production and the corresponding positive margins we would have received. So the full picture was a net loss for us, but at least we recovered our out-of-pocket costs. 
Hopefully, that provides some context for the big unusual moving pieces. 
Even with all the challenges we faced in the quarter, we feel very positive about where we are at at this point of the year. We had solid results, and Bert is now going to take you through the 2 main factors of why we are so bullish. First, course grain stocks-to-use ratios are extremely low. Meaning we expect grain prices to remain strong through several growing cycles and farmers are incented to maximize yield, driving increased demand for nitrogen. Second, global energy spreads have continued to widen, such that production costs for Eastern European plants are actually higher than China now. Meaning the nitrogen cost curve is not only steeper, but substantially wider for fourth quartile producers. Therefore, nitrogen pricing is expected to remain quite strong. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert."

As we look at the first quarter and into the foreseeable future, we believe that the positive conditions in the global nitrogen market are likely to prove resilient for some time. 
Since late 2020, global commodity crop prices have been rising steadily, driving strong nitrogen demand. Global urea prices rose alongside this demand, and prices for other nitrogen products followed. Our team did a good job of capturing these opportunities in the first quarter, especially as they dealt with the impact of the severe winter weather on our production volumes. 
I will note however that our UAN segment results do not fully reflect the positive environment at hand. We continued to face challenges there from subsidized Russian UAN imports that have depressed prices in North America. 
Coming out of the first quarter, the spring application season in North America has progressed very well. Nitrogen prices have remained high, demand is strong, and supply is tighter than the market expected. 
As we look further out, positive agricultural fundamentals are setting up an extended period of strong margins across the entire value chain. Strong global demand for all major commodity crops has resulted in low stock-to-use ratios and higher commodity crop prices. Given where those ratios are as well as the continued robust demand for commodity crops, we do not believe stocks will be replenished in just one growing season. In fact, if you look back to the last time we had stocks to use ratios this low, it took several growing seasons to recover, as you can see on Slide 9. 
As global stocks recover slowly, commodity crop prices should remain higher for some time, supporting strong financial conditions for all aspects of the channel, from producers, to wholesalers, to retailers, to farmers, to green originators, to grain processors and protein. We believe this will underpin heightened demand for nitrogen into next year and likely beyond. 
CF is well positioned for this opportunity due to an increasingly favorable global energy pricing environment. As you can see on Slide 10, energy costs in Europe and Asia have both dramatically increased from the lows of last year and returned to sizable differentials compared to Henry Hub prices. This is steep in the global cost curve significantly. Additionally, with European natural gas at around $9 per MMBtu today and the outlook from the forward curves, we expect that Eastern European producers will act as a marginal producer in the near term. 
These conditions have created a very positive environment for the company. The steeper global cost curve increases margin opportunities for low-cost producers such as CF. We also expect the traditional nitrogen price reset in the third quarter will be at levels well above the last few years. 
We are operating in the most favorable environment we have seen in many years, and we believe this will have a relatively long tail. We expect that the need to rebuild global stocks will persist at least through next year, resulting in strong economics across the agricultural value chain and robust global nitrogen demand. At the same time, forward curve suggests CF will benefit from favorable energy differentials for the foreseeable future. As a result, we believe this will have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we leverage our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to deliver for our customers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,707725659,2272625,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert.

For the first quarter of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $151 million or $0.70 per diluted share. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were $398 million. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion. 
These results reflect generally higher year-over-year prices, partially offset by lower year-over-year volumes and higher realized natural gas prices. They also reflect how we offset the challenges we faced in the first quarter through management actions. 
As Bert described, the nitrogen pricing outlook through the rest of the year is very favorable in comparison to last year. Partially offsetting this benefit will be a number of factors. We expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million tons to 10 million tons compared to 10.4 million tons last year. This reflects the impact of the planned turnaround activities and the production we lost due to the weather. This level of production, along with lower inventories to start the year, will likely result in the company selling between 19 million and 19.5 million product tons this year compared to over 20 million product tons last year. 
We also expect our natural gas costs will be higher compared to last year. Based on forward curves, we would expect our average MMBtu price at the end of the year to be similar to 2018 or 2019. 
Finally, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for this year will be in the range of $450 million. This will be much closer to our capital expenditures in 2018 and 2019, reflecting a return to normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities. 
That said, the positive nitrogen industry conditions we have described should support expanded margins for the company compared to 2020, driving significant free cash flow this year. 
We will continue to invest in growth in line with our clean energy strategy. The recent announcement of our partnership with ThyssenKrupp on our Donaldsonville green ammonia project was an important step forward in our efforts. The cost of this project fits within our typical annual capital expenditure budget. We also continue to advance discussions with other potential partners for green and blue ammonia, validating the broad opportunities we believe will be available in the future. 
In March, we repaid the $250 million remaining on our senior secured notes that were due in December. As we remain focused on investment grade and positioning the company to execute our Clean Energy's growth strategy, we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce growth debt over time. 
We will continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases at attractive levels. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Gas prices behaving itself in North America, so our cost structure is kind of where we expect it to be. And gas prices internationally have really grown out. So the TTF price in Europe, JKM price in Asia, it's very high. So to bid production into the marketplace in those regions require strong nitrogen pricing. And that not only sets up really well for Q2, but I would anticipate that that's going to be -- and Bert's going to get into this I'm sure later. That's going to mean that the reset in terms of what our fill program is, our expectation is that it will be quite a bit higher than it's been in recent years. So I don't think this ends at Q2. I think we've got a really strong rest of the year in front of us.

And then I think you have to remember, we're coming out of a pandemic. And when we were in 2020, it was a risk-off market for -- globally. And so you saw low prices in different regions and an inability or not a desire to maybe to purchase at first. And so we had a low-priced environment in Q3, Q4 and into Q1. And in our situation, I think, as well as others, you have logistical assets that move as well as plant production even with the disruptions that you have to keep moving. And so we always have a forward book on. The prices started moving up for UAN mid-Q1, and so you're not going to have an immediate price realization anyway. And so we expect to see more of that in Q2. And then as Tony mentioned, the reset will be at a different level than it has been, and we expect that to be very positive.

And I think that's going to reflect well for the fall. Fall application takes place in November. And we would project today, based on corn prices and availability, that that price will be very attractive. 
On the industrial side, that's a reflection of globally, and really for all the products, urea, UAN, ammonium nitrate and ammonia, we have a very tight market. And as Tony articulated, driven by energy cost differentials, high-cost producers has been attractive to import and buy and decrease or even stop that production of ammonia. That quickly tightened up the global ammonia market in the Baltic, Black as well as in Tampa. And you've seen prices move up to above $500. It's been many, many years since we've been at that level. You have healthy margins on the phosphate side. So the phosphate producers are trying to acquire enough ammonia for their operations. And then you've had a recovery economically, which has driven the industrial demand for synthetic fibers in different areas along the Gulf Coast. As well as globally, you're going to see a tight ammonia market through this year and probably into next. And I think you're right. The competition for that [ ton, ] there's a portion of our book that's consistent with industrial demand. And then we normally get a better margin uplift from ag, but we'll be watching that and moving appropriately or as necessary to capture that opportunity."

So your question on setting a floor, NOLA, I would kind of take it to a global. It sets a global floor. And you're going to see that in the -- we've already seen in the India tender that was opened this morning or yesterday. and the prices that reflect probably an ag number of 3 20 to 3 30 a metric ton FOB. And you have significant amount of demand that needs to be covered without heavy inventories globally. So coupled with expensive or high-cost producers now having an inability to export or participate in the export market, low inventory levels globally, a need for Brazil and India to consistently be in the market and purchase from now -- from this point forward, and then you'll get into a -- our season will pick up later on in the year. You have a very good platform for a very healthy floor level, probably higher than what people are anticipating. And then if you're an end user in this kind of -- whether it's industrial or ag in this economic market, you're going to be making sure that you have sufficient supply on hand. So that will be the pull on demand. At $7 corn, $7 wheat, $88 on cotton, we just go product by product, there will be that healthy incremental demand that will soak up supply. So we would say, today looking for the floors, that they will be positive. 
And you're right, the ammonia and UAN values are pulling closer to urea. And I think we'll see an interesting dynamic play out this year in the farm sector with how much of ammonia is actually put down and then the move to upgraded products. And then especially on the pivot runs and race run, which extend this tail, that's why I talked about in my prepared remarks the extended tail. We have a cool weather right now, so emergence is okay. Planting is going very well. But when you're fertilizing for yield at $7 corn and the opportunity that's out there, you're going to see that incremental demand. That will probably be in urea and UAN. And then looking to next year at $6 corn and even into 2023, we've got a very positive price environment that's going to, again, be the demand pull that we haven't seen in years for the nitrogen products."

When you look at it today, and talking with some of the different participants in the grain markets, you're probably going to be leaning -- or at least me personally leaning more towards 94 million acres. And then as I talked about earlier, additional applications for yield, you're going to have a very robust demand coming probably starting -- it already has started, and pulling contracts early. 
So I don't see big inventories. And you're going to need to fill those inventories because, on the back of this year, and the back of this yield, if it's even average or good, we're going to have to repeat that in 2022. And so when you're looking at the fill programs as well as the fall application of ammonia, I'm not going to give a price today. We've had several customers asking us for that. But we expect it to be at a higher level. One, because it's worth it. Nitrogen is what's going to give you yield. It's a good value. And as I said earlier, every one of the value chain, even at whatever levels we come out with, is at a healthy profitability level and balance sheet position. So this is a very good time for our industry. And we're going to be excited to launch our fill program and work with our customers to make it a success for them as well as us."

For Q2, as I said earlier, we always have a book going into the quarter. And we have been active every day in the market. If you do your channel checks, we're selling. We still have products to sell for Q2. So there are different products, move at different times. And ammonia is generally first. And so those programs are -- part of our program was sold in December and part of it was left open for this period. And then you move into urea and UAN, for wheat. And then as you move further north. And we're just starting those applications in the north as well as Canada, that's for ammonia. And it will move then to urea and UAN. The bulk of the UAN market will be in the latter part of May and early June. And we think we're well positioned for that also and have tons available for the pivot run, which is your irrigated runs as well as the rice run. So more to come, but we like where we are."

So from a Chinese perspective, we've continued to see them be the marginal producer. But as Bert mentioned in his remarks, what we started to see here is with the expansion of the energy differentials is that you're actually seeing Eastern European and Asian be equivalent to those marginal producers and a widening of the cost curve in that fourth quartile, along with the steepening of the slope. So I'll let Bert talk maybe about what type of exports he's expecting for this year from China."

The specifics to China, and obviously, we're following it because they do represent roughly 10% of the export market and are the more -- have been the marginal producer that expand and contract as pricing allows and have been active participants in the India tenders. 
So on a percent of capacity, we estimate, just like some of the publications, they've been in the 70, 71, 72. And that would be laying out for the year about 56 million to 57 million tons of production. Exports, we're estimating around 5 million tons. 
But the thing we have to remember and pay attention to is consumption in China. Consumption in China over the last 4 years has risen from 48 million tons, we estimate, to 52 million tons. So an additional 4 million tons, what is happening? Well, guess what? They need to also fertilize for yield. And the tremendous imports that have taken place in China corn and soybeans this year is a reflection of their inability to produce that. One, it's a shortage of water and soil. But it seems to me that they are now trying to take care of some of that, at least for the next growing season. So positive dynamics out of China that has a 5 million-ton exporter, and I think the majority of that will go to India. We're expecting India this year to be a 10 million ton importer. So the swings and the ability to move the market out of China is not the same than it was, let's say, 6 or 7, 8 years ago."

And therefore, based on consumption, there are going to be larger importers, which likely China is going to take a big piece of that. So again, we're very constructive not only in terms of the overall S&D balance, but with energy differentials where they are and the cost of the high end, where it is, that suggests a very favorable nitrogen pricing deck for North American producers."

And particularly with where LNG is trading right now, our expectation is that, in most cases, it's going to be cheaper based on the efficiencies or the inefficiencies of some of those older plants to import domestically trade -- or globally traded urea as opposed to try to run those. There's also, as we understand, it's been because of the impact of COVID and what's going on over there right now, real challenges on supply chain and labor issues.

And there was a lot more downgrades or negative watches than there was anything positive. And although our results were down a little bit sequentially in 2020 over 2019, demand for our products remained really strong, and it was really a pricing environment. And as Chris said, based on the pricing environment that we're seeing now, and this is a prolonged period, along with continued reduction in debt, I think we have a very strong argument, even without taking down incremental debt, that we're an investment-grade company at this point. But we're continuing to have those conversations. I wouldn't say they're quick to respond. And they tend to be fairly risk-averse.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $398 million. These results are really the story of nitrogen prices that increased throughout the quarter, somewhat offset due to lower production and corresponding sales volumes. 
There were a lot of other things happening during the quarter, such as winter weather driving up LNG demand and corresponding gas prices, and one very large winter storm event in the U.S. But if you take all of these impacts together, they roughly offset each other. 
Let me provide a bit of color on our response to these events, but I'd like to refer you to Slide 6 and 7 in our posted materials. 
Back in February, leading into Presidents' Day weekend, an extreme winter storm hit the U.S. Gas suppliers into several of our locations curtailed gas deliveries, and we were informed that we would likely force majeure hard shutdowns. Our team mobilized quickly, discussed various options and decided on the following course of action. Given we are facing the loss of gas delivery into our plants and would be shut down anyway, we opted to effectively sell the gas we had contracted for back to our suppliers by net settling our gas delivery contracts at prevailing market prices. We also reduced operating rates to minimum levels at some plants that were still receiving gas and sold the excess gas above those minimum levels back to suppliers. The result was a gain on sale of gas of $112 million. 
Slide 6 provides some details of how we mitigate gas price risk and how the February storm affected gas prices. 
However, there were pretty significant impacts to our operations as a result of the shutdowns and freeze-offs. We experienced some prolonged outages and increased maintenance expense, including fixed cost write-offs as a result of the abrupt disruption and extreme cold. And of course, gas price rose for that portion of our gas that was not hedged. Because we lost a fair bit of production, we chose to go into the market and purchased urea barges so that we could meet existing customer commitments, which also cost us a small amount. 
The net result of all of this is shown on Slide 7 of our materials. 
Net-net, our sale of gas mitigated our increased costs so we came out of it basically even. Now we did lose production and the corresponding positive margins we would have received. So the full picture was a net loss for us, but at least we recovered our out-of-pocket costs. 
Hopefully, that provides some context for the big unusual moving pieces. 
Even with all the challenges we faced in the quarter, we feel very positive about where we are at, at this point of the year. We had solid results, and Bert is now going to take you through the 2 main factors of why we are so bullish. First, coarse grains stocks-to-use ratios are extremely low. Meaning we expect grain prices to remain strong through several growing cycles and farmers are incented to maximize yield, driving increased demand for nitrogen. Second, global energy spreads have continued to widen, such that production costs for Eastern European plants are actually higher than China now. Meaning the nitrogen cost curve is not only steeper, but substantially wider for fourth quartile producers. Therefore, nitrogen pricing is expected to remain quite strong. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert."

As we look at the first quarter and into the foreseeable future, we believe that the positive conditions in the global nitrogen market are likely to prove resilient for some time. 
Since late 2020, global commodity crop prices have been rising steadily, driving strong nitrogen demand. Global urea prices rose alongside this demand and prices for other nitrogen products followed. Our team did a good job of capturing these opportunities in the first quarter, especially as they dealt with the impact of the severe winter weather on our production volumes. 
I will note, however, that our UAN segment results do not fully reflect the positive environment at hand. We continue to face challenges there from subsidized Russian UAN imports that have depressed prices in North America. 
Coming out of the first quarter, the spring application season in North America has progressed very well. Nitrogen prices have remained high, demand is strong and supply is tighter than the market expected. 
As we look further out, positive agricultural fundamentals are setting up an extended period of strong margins across the entire value chain. Strong global demand for all major commodity crops has resulted in low stocks-to-use ratios and higher commodity crop prices. Given where those ratios are, as well as the continued robust demand for commodity crops, we do not believe stocks will be replenished in just one growing season. In fact, if you look back to the last time we had stocks-to-use ratios this low, it took several growing seasons to recover, as you can see on Slide 9. 
As global stocks recover slowly, commodity crop prices should remain higher for some time, supporting strong financial conditions for all aspects of the channel, from producers, to wholesalers, to retailers, to farmers, to grain originators, to grain processors and protein. We believe this will underpin heightened demand for nitrogen into next year and likely beyond. 
CF is well positioned for this opportunity due to an increasingly favorable global energy pricing environment. As you can see on Slide 10, energy costs in Europe and Asia have both dramatically increased from the lows of last year and returned to sizable differentials compared to Henry Hub prices. This is steep in the global cost curve significantly. Additionally, with European natural gas at around $9 per MMBtu today and the outlook from the forward curves, we expect that Eastern European producers will act as a marginal producer in the near term. 
These conditions have created a very positive environment for the company. The steeper global cost curve increases margin opportunities for low-cost producers such as CF. We also expect the traditional nitrogen price reset in the third quarter will be at levels well above the last few years. 
We are operating in the most favorable environment we have seen in many years, and we believe this will have a relatively long tail. We expect that the need to rebuild global stocks will persist at least through next year, resulting in strong economics across the agricultural value chain and robust global nitrogen demand. At the same time, forward curve suggests CF will benefit from favorable energy differentials for the foreseeable future. As a result, we believe this will have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we leverage our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to deliver for our customers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,707725659,2273476,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert.

For the first quarter of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $151 million or $0.70 per diluted share. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were $398 million. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion. 
These results reflect generally higher year-over-year prices, partially offset by lower year-over-year volumes and higher realized natural gas prices. They also reflect how we offset the challenges we faced in the first quarter through management actions. 
As Bert described, the nitrogen pricing outlook through the rest of the year is very favorable in comparison to last year. Partially offsetting this benefit will be a number of factors. We expect gross ammonia production to be around 9.5 million to 10 million tons compared to 10.4 million tons last year. This reflects the impact of the planned turnaround activities and the production we lost due to the weather. This level of production, along with lower inventories to start the year, will likely result in the company selling between 19 million and 19.5 million product tons this year compared to over 20 million product tons last year. 
We also expect our natural gas costs will be higher compared to last year. Based on forward curves, we would expect our average MMBtu price at the end of the year to be similar to 2018 or 2019. 
Finally, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for this year will be in the range of $450 million. This will be much closer to our capital expenditures in 2018 and 2019, reflecting a return to normal level of planned maintenance and turnaround activities. 
That said, the positive nitrogen industry conditions we have described should support expanded margins for the company compared to 2020, driving significant free cash flow this year. 
We will continue to invest in growth in line with our clean energy strategy. The recent announcement of our partnership with ThyssenKrupp on our Donaldsonville green ammonia project was an important step forward in our efforts. The cost of this project fits within our typical annual capital expenditure budget. We also continue to advance discussions with other potential partners for green and blue ammonia, validating the broad opportunities we believe will be available in the future. 
In March, we repaid the $250 million remaining on our senior secured notes that were due in December. As we remain focused on investment grade and positioning the company to execute our clean energy's growth strategy, we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce gross debt over time. 
We will continue to return cash to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases at attractive levels. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Gas prices behaving itself in North America, so our cost structure is kind of where we expect it to be. And gas prices internationally have really blown out. So the TTF price in Europe, the JKM price in Asia, it's very high. So to bid production into the marketplace in those regions requires strong nitrogen pricing. And that not only sets up really well for Q2, but I would anticipate that that's going to be -- and Bert's going to get into this, I'm sure, later. That's going to mean that the reset in terms of what our fill program is, our expectation is that will be quite a bit higher than it's been in recent years. So I don't think this ends at Q2. I think we've got a really strong rest of the year in front of us. And in fact, based on, as Bert talked about, the stocks-to-use ratio and it taking more than one growing season to recover, we think this is at least into 2022, if not beyond.

And so you saw low prices in different regions and an inability or not a desire to maybe to purchase at first. And so we had a low-priced environment in Q3, Q4 and into Q1. And in our situation, I think, as well as others, you have logistical assets that move as well as plant production, even with the disruptions that you have to keep moving. And so we always have a forward book on. The prices started moving up for UAN mid-Q1 and so you're not going to have an immediate price realization anyway. And so we expect to see more of that in Q2. And then as Tony mentioned, the reset will be at a different level than it has been, and we expect that to be very positive. So more thing are -- better things to come, we think.

And I think that's going to reflect well for the fall. Fall application takes place in November. And we would project today, based on corn prices and availability, that, that price will be very attractive. 
On the industrial side, that's a reflection of globally, and really for all the products, urea, UAN, ammonium nitrate and ammonia, we have a very tight market. And as Tony articulated, driven by energy cost differentials, high-cost producers has been attractive to import and buy and decrease or even stop that production of ammonia. That quickly tightened up the global ammonia market in the Baltics, Black as well as in Tampa. And you've seen prices move up to above $500. It's been many, many years since we've been at that level. You have healthy margins on the phosphate side. So the phosphate producers are trying to acquire enough ammonia for their operations. And then you've had a recovery economically, which has driven the industrial demand for synthetic fibers in different areas along the Gulf Coast. As well as globally, you're going to see a tight ammonia market through this year and probably into next. And I think you're right. The competition for that ton, there's a portion of our book that's consistent with industrial demand. And then we normally get a better margin uplift from ag, but we'll be watching that and moving appropriately or as necessary to capture that opportunity."

And you're going to see that in the -- we've already seen in the India tender that was opened this morning or yesterday. And the prices that reflect probably an ag number of $320 to $330 a metric ton FOB. And you have significant amount of demand that needs to be covered without heavy inventories globally. 
So coupled with expensive or high-cost producers now having an inability to export or participate in the export market, low inventory levels globally, a need for Brazil and India to consistently be in the market and purchase from now -- from this point forward, and then you'll get into a -- our season will pick up later on in the year, you have a very good platform for a very healthy floor level, probably higher than what people are anticipating. And then if you're an end user in this kind of -- whether it's industrial or ag in this economic market, you're going to be making sure that you have sufficient supply on hand. So that will be the pull on demand. At $7 corn, $7 wheat, $88 on cotton, I mean, just go product by product, there will be that healthy incremental demand that will soak up supply. So we would say, today looking for the floors, that they will be positive. 
And you're right, the ammonia and UAN values are pulling closer to urea. And I think we'll see an interesting dynamic play out this year in the farm sector with how much of ammonia is actually put down and then the move to upgraded products. And then especially on the pivot runs and [ rise-run ], which extend this tail, that's why I talked about in my prepared remarks the extended tail, we have a cool weather right now, so emergence is okay. Planting is going very well. But when you're fertilizing for yield at $7 corn and the opportunity that's out there, you're going to see that incremental demand. That will probably be in urea and UAN. And then looking to next year at $6 corn and even into 2023, we've got a very positive price environment that's going to, again, be the demand pull that we haven't seen in years for the nitrogen products."

When you look at summer fill, we've had different programs for different years depending on when demand materializes, what our situation and what the kind of the opportunity is for inventory.

When you look at summer fill, we've had different programs for different years depending on when demand materializes, what our situation and what the kind of the opportunity is for inventory. And we believe this year, because of the tail that's needed to -- for applications, that you're going to have a later season than normal. The latest we've gone is August. The earliest we've gone is June. So I would trend -- tend to be on the latter side of that spread for moving the -- or announcing the fill program. 
Inventories are going to be low for all products. And just looking at the imports to date and the production to date, feathering in what was lost in the winter storm in February amongst the different producers, and again, with -- we're projecting 91 million, 92 million acres. When you look at it today and talking with some of the different participants in the grain markets, you're probably going to be leaning -- or at least me, personally leaning more towards 94 million acres. And then as I talked about earlier, additional applications for yield, you're going to have a very robust demand coming probably starting -- it already has started and pulling contracts early. 
So I don't see big inventories. And you're going to need to fill those inventories because, on the back of this year and the back of this yield, if it's even average or good, we're going to have to repeat that in 2022. And so when you're looking at the fill programs as well as the fall application of ammonia, I'm not going to give a price today. We've had several customers asking us for that. But we expect it to be at a higher level. One, because it's worth it. Nitrogen is what's going to give you yield. It's at a good value. And as I said earlier, every one of the value chain, even at whatever levels we come out with, is at a healthy profitability level and balance sheet position. So this is a very good time for our industry. And we're going to be excited to launch our fill program and work with our customers to make it a success for them as well as us."

For Q2, as I said earlier, we always have a book going into the quarter. And we have been active every day in the market. If you do your channel checks, we're selling. We still have products to sell for Q2. So there are -- different products move at different times. And ammonia is generally first. And so those programs are -- part of our program was sold in December and part of it was left open for this period. And then you move into urea and UAN for wheat, and then as you move further north. And we're just starting those applications in the north as well as Canada, that's for ammonia. And it will move then to urea and UAN. The bulk of the UAN market will be in the latter part of May and early June. And we think we're well positioned for that also and have tons available for the pivot run, which is your irrigated runs as well as the [ rise-run ]. So more to come, but we like where we are."

Chinese coal, there had been a lot of discussion about Chinese coal softening, specifically anthracite, over the past year.

So from a Chinese perspective, we've continued to see them be the marginal producer. But as Bert mentioned in his remarks, what we started to see here is with the expansion of the energy differentials is that you're actually seeing Eastern European and Asian be equivalent to those marginal producers and a widening of the cost curve in that fourth quartile, along with the steepening of the slope. So I'll let Bert talk maybe about what type of exports he's expecting for this year from China."

The specifics to China, and obviously, we're following it because they do represent roughly 10% of the export market and are the -- have been the marginal producer that expand and contract as pricing allows and have been active participants in the India tenders. 
So on a percent of capacity, we estimate, just like some of the publications, they've been in the 70, 71, 72. And that would be laying out for the year about 56 million to 57 million tons of production. Exports, we're estimating around 5 million tons. 
But the thing we have to remember and pay attention to is consumption in China. Consumption in China over the last 4 years has risen from 48 million tons, we estimate, to 52 million tons. So an additional 4 million tons, what is happening? Well, guess what? They need to also fertilize for yield. And the tremendous imports that have taken place in China of corn and soybeans this year is a reflection of their inability to produce that. One, it's a shortage of water and soil. But it seems to me that they are now trying to take care of some of that, at least for the next growing season. So positive dynamics out of China that has a 5 million ton exporter, and I think the majority of that will go to India. We're expecting India this year to be a 10 million ton importer. So the swings and the ability to move the market out of China is not the same than it was, let's say, 6 or 7, 8 years ago."

And the other thing that we're watching very closely, and Bert mentioned this about India, is our expectation is that domestic production in India is going to be down. And therefore, based on consumption, there are going to be larger importers, which likely China is going to take a big piece of that. So again, we're very constructive not only in terms of the overall S&D balance, but with energy differentials where they are and the cost of the high end, where it is, that suggests a very favorable nitrogen pricing deck for North American producers."

And particularly with where LNG is trading right now, our expectation is that, in most cases, it's going to be cheaper based on the efficiencies or the inefficiencies of some of those older plants to import domestically trade -- or globally traded urea as opposed to try to run those. There's also, as we understand, has been because of the impact of COVID and what's going on over there right now, real challenges on supply chain and labor issues.

And as Chris said, based on the pricing environment that we're seeing now, and this is a prolonged period, along with continued reduction in debt, I think we have a very strong argument, even without taking down incremental debt, that we're an investment-grade company at this point. But we're continuing to have those conversations. I wouldn't say they're quick to respond. And they tend to be fairly risk-averse.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion. Strong nitrogen demand and lower overall production have tightened the global supply-demand balance, supporting much higher prices than in recent years. 
At the same time, energy spreads between North America and high-cost regions have expanded considerably, increasing margin opportunities for our cost advantage network. These factors helped drive an increase in adjusted EBITDA of nearly 25% compared to last year, and we produced our strongest first half financial results in 6 years. Additionally, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow, giving us tremendous flexibility as we focus on achieving investment-grade metrics and executing our clean energy initiatives. 
The first half was not without its challenges, including the natural gas-driven production interruptions we described on the first quarter call. The first half also saw a continued demonstration of the harm the UAN industry in the United States faces from subsidized and dumped imports from Russia and Trinidad. Until the last few years, UAN earned a substantial premium to other upgraded nitrogen products due to the higher capital investment required to produce it and the meaningful agronomic and operational benefit it offers to farmers. 
As you can see from our recent results, UAN now trades at a significant discount to all upgraded nitrogen products due to unfair trade practices. We have taken the necessary steps to address this situation by petitioning the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to initiate antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. We look forward to the result of the ITC's preliminary vote later this week. 
Looking forward, we are very bullish about the next 2 years. As Bert will describe in a moment, the need to replenish global course grain stocks driving agricultural demand, along with the impact of increased economic activity driving industrial demand, should support all-time record global nitrogen demand over the next 2 years. Forward energy curves are also very favorable over this time frame. We expect these factors to help keep the global nitrogen supply and demand balance much tighter than we've seen in recent years, supporting an extended period of higher nitrogen pricing and higher margins for our cost advantage network. 
Longer term, we believe increased demand for ammonia and its clean energy attributes will become a significant factor in the tighter supply and demand balance, driving further value for our network. We continue to see broad interest in clean hydrogen and ammonia to help meet the world's clean energy needs. As we continue to have discussions with market participants, our focus remains on being at the forefront of this significant opportunity from positioning our network to be the world's leader for blue and green ammonia production to collaborating with other global leaders where our unique capabilities can provide value. We are pleased with the progress we've made and look forward to additional developments in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position, before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

The global nitrogen supply and demand balance remains far tighter than we have seen in recent years, underpinned by strong agricultural and industrial demand, plus higher energy prices in Europe and Asia. This has created a highly favorable pricing environment that has persisted into the second half of this year. Based on the agriculture and energy outlook we see today, we believe a positive pricing environment for fertilizer will remain in place, at least into 2023. 
Strong global nitrogen demand is being led by the world's need to replenish course grain stocks. The global course grain stock-to-use ratio was the lowest since 2012, entering this year's spring planting season. Commodity prices have risen significantly in response, and farmers are incentivized to maximize yield with fertilizer applications. 
Given this, we expect to see sustained demand in the second half, led by India and Brazil. We expect similar strength from North America and Europe leading into the 2022 application season. We had a positive start to meeting this demand a few weeks ago when we launched our UAN fill program. We have built a solid order book for the third quarter at a NOLA equivalent price of $285 per ton, though prices remain at a significant discount to urea for the reasons Tony mentioned. 
Further out, we expect that high demand for course grains, especially from China, will contribute to persistent low global stocks into next year. As a result, we believe that stocks will still need to be replenished, at least into 2023, supporting continued strong nitrogen demand. 
Increased economic activity is also driving higher global industrial demand for nitrogen. In North America, we have seen diesel exhaust fluid sales rise above pre-pandemic levels. Our first half DES sales were a company record, and we expect overall demand will continue to grow. We've also seen higher demand for ammonia and nitric acid from our industrial customers. Globally, industrial-related demand in China and from phosphate producers has also increased. While we expect demand to remain strong for some time, we believe that global fertilizer inventory in the channel today is low and will need to be rebuilt. So far in 2021, high energy costs in Europe and Asia have lowered operating rates and reduced supply availability, particularly for ammonia and urea, further supporting global pricing. 
As you can see on Slide 9, energy costs in these regions have increased to over $14 per MMBtu, and Eastern European producers have become the global marginal producer for the time being. The higher energy costs has steepened the global nitrogen cost curve substantially, increasing margin opportunities for low-cost producers such as CF. Forward curve suggests CF will benefit from favorable energy differentials for the foreseeable future. As a result, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we leverage our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to deliver for our customers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $397 million or $1.83 per diluted share.

For the first half of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $397 million or $1.83 per diluted share. EBITDA was $994 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $997 million. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $700 million. Based on the outlook Tony and Bert have shared, we are well positioned to build on these results and continue to generate significant free cash flow. 
I want to provide additional context to 2 items we covered in our press release. First, we raised our estimate for capital expenditures for 2021 from around $450 million to approximately $500 million. The increase is driven primarily by our decision to pull a significant maintenance events scheduled for next year into this year. We believe that performing this activity in 2021 is best for the asset and reduces the risk of an unplanned outage during the 2022 spring application season. Going forward, we expect capital expenditures to return to the range of $450 million per year. 
With this additional maintenance project, the high level of previously planned maintenance and the additional maintenance from severe weather in February, we estimate that gross ammonia production and sales volume will be around 9.5 million tons and 19 million product tons, respectively, both at the low end of our forecast earlier this year. Looking into 2022, we have a more typical maintenance schedule and would expect to return to approximately 10 million tons of ammonia production and sales volume of 19.5 million to 20 million product tons. 
Second, we are taking additional steps in line with our focus on achieving investment-grade ratings and positioning the company to execute our clean energy initiatives. We have announced that we will redeem $250 million of our senior notes due June 2023, which will reduce our gross debt to $3.5 billion. We expect to lower our gross debt to $3 billion by or before the maturity of the 2023 notes. We also continue to return cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases at attractive levels. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize everyone at CF for their strong work during the first half.

Most importantly, we did this safely with our recordable incident rate at the end of June at just 0.28 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. 
As we look ahead, we expect strong agricultural and industrial demand to create all-time record global nitrogen demand. Forward curves show very favorable energy spreads to Europe and Asia over the same time frame, which should support robust margins and cash generation. We see good progress on our core synergy initiatives. Taken together, we are well positioned to create significant shareholder value in the near and longer term.

And then subsequently, we've been able to get a little bit of further appreciation off of the $285 number. So we're really pleased with how the order book is set up right now and what the back half of the year looks like. We've seen strong interest in ammonia for the fall already.

So by getting investment grade, that senior secured drops off of that allows us a little bit more activity. But I think really where your question is going is with return of capital and different things like that. I think what we see over the next several years here with free cash flow generation is we're really going to be able to reduce our debt to that gross target of $3 billion, invest in our clean energy initiatives specifically those that we've announced already and then additionally return cash to shareholders.

Based on the amount of turnaround activity and other maintenance work that was going on, we ended up with almost $60 million of sort of incremental maintenance and fixed cost write-off associated with the plants in Q2 versus last year. And then on top of that, we ended up with about $100 million that hits the cost of goods sold line through the first half of the year. That's based on purchased product for resale. And part of it was based on the commitments we have made to customers with the plant outages and the turnarounds. We needed to cover those positions and make sure we could provide reliable supply on our commitments. And so we went out and purchased both urea and ammonia to cover some of those requirements. And so in an average or in an otherwise kind of normalized year, you wouldn't see that $100 million hit the COGS line in that kind of way. And so those are sort of 2 big pieces that I'm thinking we won't have to the same magnitude second half.

P.J., on the cost of gas, what I'd say is more important than the absolute cost that we face is what the energy spread differential is. And so while last year, you saw very low gas costs, both in the U.S. and also in the U.K. You also saw global energy costs that were dramatically reduced, partly COVID-driven. And as a result, although our costs were low, our margin opportunity was also compressed because you saw really high operating rates. Right now, what you see is energy cost differentials between the U.S. and Europe and Asia is like $10 or $11 per MMBtu. And so you see a huge margin differential between what the high-cost producers are running at and what our network runs at. And so as we think about it, despite the fact that our costs are going up, our margins are expanding much more rapidly than what our costs are going up. This is a great environment for us. In fact, I think -- and this is a chart that we'll likely be producing in the future. We've looked at this analysis that the higher the gas cost is in Henry Hub because the U.S. is such an important contributor into the LNG market, particularly on more of a spot basis, what you tend to see is higher energy differentials in LNG import regions. And as a result of that, there's typically margin expansion when our cost structures is a little bit higher. This is a good thing for us instead of a headwind for us. But as we look forward, we tend to just believe in the forward energy, where the forward curve trades on the NYMEX and some of the other major pricing indices that we don't have a lot of additional insight over kind of where the market puts forward."

Because of COVID last year and us trying to protect our employees and minimize the number of contractors we had on site, we reduced it to just 2 major turnarounds last year, which is one of the reasons we set an all-time ammonia production record last year because we had fewer turnaround activities. This year, we've got 7 instead of 4. So the 2 that we were supposed to do last year that we moved forward, the 4 that were already scheduled for this year. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we're bringing 1 of them from next year backwards into this year to make sure that we've got reliable operation on that asset. In addition to being 7 instead of 4, 2 of the turnarounds were our major expansion plants. So our 2 biggest plants in the network, both the Donaldsonville 6 and Port Neal 2 ammonia plants. And those tend to be a little longer and a little more expensive than the rest of the network or the average-sized plants. This is the first time they've undergone a major turnaround. But our expectation as a result of this is that we're well positioned to be looking at potentially able to set an all-time production record next year for ammonia. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we got Port Neal 2 done this year. Because our view is as good as the pricing opportunity is right now, we think next year looks very strong as well, and we want to make sure we can run flat out. So what we're really doing is setting up for the future here, and I feel very good about where we're positioned."

If anything, it wouldn't shock us to see further restrictions on urea exports or really trying to push that down instead of up. And so I think just kind of lack of substantial availability and also a pretty stable price outlook on that suggests to us that China, while always important, may not be the global price setter going forward. Again, Lucas, as we look at the forward curves, we tend to look at what TTF and JKM are and as well as the NYMEX on Henry Hub. And if you just look at those differentials, that provides a really terrific margin opportunity for our network."

And then we launched the UAN fill program at that $285 NOLA and then stair stepped it up as we go through up through the Midwest, and built a healthy order book for Q3 and now have looked at Q4 pricing. For urea, the market has kind of stayed in the range of $420 to $440 FOB NOLA, and then obviously, stair stepped up through the Midwest and into Canada. And so we have a healthy book on for all 3 products and look forward to, as Tony and Chris have both articulated through their comments and questions, we see just due to the structural nature of the global markets for grains and oilseeds and just some of the climatic difficulties that have taken place, both in the United States up from Midwest and Brazil and just low inventories, all these things coupled together and low inventories of fertilizer, probably see a positive pricing environment for Q4 and into the next year.

Yes, currently, availability of Class 6 permanent geological sequestration is potentially the limiting factor, although there are opportunities to sequester CO2 tomorrow if we had the dehydration and compression in place on -- for EOR applications. And even for EOR, you are provided some level of the 45Q tax benefit from that. So it's not quite the full benefit, but it's available kind of now if we're ready. And that's one of the reasons we're pushing so quickly on dehydration of compression because we want to get that in place and really have that up and running, availing ourselves of the opportunity available now and be able to go immediately into injection wells when those permits are issued and they're ready to go. Relative to us wanting to get into that, that's not really our area of expertise. We're -- that's one of the areas where we look to other market participants and want to rely on their expertise. And there's a lot of subsurface geology and things that we just are not set up to do. And so instead of trying to replicate that, we want to kind of partner and work with other people that that's their bread and butter. I would say there are a number of people that have come to us and said the geology within just a couple of miles of Donaldsonville is well situated for Class 6 permits and they're going after those kinds of things. And so what we're talking about is, generally speaking, a pretty short haul run in order to get to them. And so that's very encouraging just in terms of what the overall time frame and cost structure looks like to do injection."

The dehydration and compression systems that we're looking at for CO2 in Donaldsonville, it's probably in the range of about $200 million. And that should be able to provide us with about 1 million tons of blue ammonia. And I think we can get there in 2 years or by the beginning of 2024. And then we're also looking at potentially a similar dehydration compression unit in Yazoo City, Mississippi, which should be able to provide us another, call it, 300,000, 250,000 to 300,000 tons of blue ammonia. And that would probably be in the $70 million to $80 million range. So the projects that we've announced so far are kind of sub-$400 million spread over the next 2 to 3 years. And based on the increased margin and cash flow that we're seeing from operations that easily account -- taken care of just based on normal spending levels. Plus with the big slug of turnaround activity that we'll have in the rearview mirror here going next year back to more normalized rates, I think we're in a good position to be able to manage all of that. The thing that's exciting though is, as you mentioned, a couple of our announcements, both with the Singapore Port, Itochu consortium looking at ammonia and marine fuel, which we think there's real legs to that and probably happening sooner than we initially thought, along with our Mitsui announcement around evaluating blue ammonia opportunities, is there's a very likely a chance for us to potentially accelerate some of those opportunities and help this market develop more quickly. And so we're certainly interested in thinking about additional investments above and beyond. But I think, again, based on our enhanced free cash flow generation right now, we're not worried about being able to fund that. We feel that we're really in a great spot given our ability to leverage our existing asset base and get to blue and green ammonia much more both quickly and much more cheaply than other people can replicate that."

So I think that that's always a good thing. But given where soy prices are, and in fact, given what we view is going to be an increasing movement toward biodiesel and a lot of that coming from oilseeds, I think you'll see ongoing competition between the acre, whether it's soy or corn. And so I think all of this is good because on the one hand, what we don't want to see is a huge oversupply of corn acres driving a high stocks to use ratio and then you end up being depressed. So I think a nice, healthy balance where acres are being competed for is really good, particularly given the fact that now in -- as economic activity is picking back up after COVID, we're seeing all-time demand into the industrial sector for nitrogen products. And so we don't need to see huge increases in corn acres. In fact, that would be a bad thing for us.

And that's going to impact kind of that whole region and it has, especially for shipping on the [indiscernible], the river there coming out of Argentina. And so what we're looking at is some structural changes that are taking place in Brazil with ethanol production, especially in the interior and then combined feeding, which is also consuming more feed grains. So when you look at the whole picture and what they're looking at in terms of it doesn't necessarily require more acres, but just higher yields. Higher yields are driven by more nitrogen.

That's really where it should trade. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's both more capital intensive, and therefore, you need to earn an appropriate rate of return on that incremental capital investment to incent people to make that product and it also has significant economic and operational efficiencies for farmers. And so because it's both good for the grower and its higher cost to produce, it ought to carry a premium, and that's where it was. And that's really where it should be in the absence of dumped tons. So that's where we think it goes to longer term. The U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity is sufficient to serve the U.S. demand -- and so there's really no need for those imported, particularly the subsidized tons to show up over here. And so I think we're well positioned to satisfy U.S. demand. And what it does then is it just means we don't have to export those tons like we used to. In terms of overall timing on kind of when imports would stop showing up, I think that's a little bit TBD, but we're talking about relatively short term on that. In the event that it's not a favorable outcome, I think it's just business as usual because that's the world that we're living in currently. So it's not like there's downside to what today is that we're operating with all of those tons coming in today, and we're finding a way to navigate it despite the fact that it's challenging.

So some of those end up being sort of a natural hedge for us, which isn't a bad thing at all. But it's certainly one of those things that Bert and his team evaluate how much and how high.

And I think that certainly, there has been some challenges in the interim during that period of time. But I also think we've done some things that make the company stronger today than it's ever been in the past. And if you look at how much cash flow we're generating today and how many shares that are outstanding, the ratio is better today than it was even back in the highest-priced days of the stock and/or the highest EBITDA that we were generating in the company's history. And so I think the sector may not be in that much favor right now in the marketplace, but I think the fundamentals of this business are better than they've ever been in the past. And I would also say we've taken out, I think, over 50 million shares out of our share count through repurchases, and it's probably even more than 50 million shares. And that actually has not theme to -- led to any kind of dramatic improvement. And so I'm not sure share repurchase is the answer. I think what really does drive value for investors in the near term, it's the fundamentals that we're looking at, which are better than anything we've seen in the last 7 or 8 years. And in the longer term, it is the fact that ammonia and hydrogen, I think, are really the clear clean energy sources of the future as economies decarbonize, and we're in the best position to capitalize on that. And as demand starts ramping up and exceeding supply, I think what you'll see is asset values will tend toward replacement costs, which is way above where they are today. And so it gives us the opportunity to think about how we want to participate in that marketplace, and it puts growth clearly back on the radar screen, whether that's inorganic or organic. But the fact of the matter is I firmly believe that you move the clock forward several years and ammonia is going to be in tight supply and people are going to be racing to need to build it. And when that happens, you see a dramatic uptick in terms of asset value. So we're very optimistic about the return profile that we offer to our investors."

So it's not easily available to go into the market and purchase UAN. We chose to purchase urea and some ammonia and run UAN at a very high level to meet customer commitments. So across the board, on every product, we were able to deliver on time and even with the substantial disruption that took place in February and March. And so that's why you saw a volume uptick.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion. Strong nitrogen demand and lower overall production have tightened the global supply-demand balance, supporting much higher prices than in recent years. At the same time, energy spreads between North America and high-cost regions have expanded considerably, increasing margin opportunities for our cost advantage network. These factors helped drive an increase in adjusted EBITDA of nearly 25% compared to last year, and we produced our strongest first half financial results in 6 years. Additionally, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow, giving us tremendous flexibility as we focus on achieving investment-grade metrics and executing our clean energy initiatives.  
The first half was not without its challenges, including the natural gas-driven production interruptions we described on the first quarter call. The first half also saw a continued demonstration of the harm the UAN industry in the United States faces from subsidized and dumped imports from Russia and Trinidad. Until the last few years, UAN earned a substantial premium to other upgraded nitrogen products due to the higher capital investment required to produce it and the meaningful agronomic and operational benefit it offers to farmers. As you can see from our recent results, UAN now trades at a significant discount to all upgraded nitrogen products due to unfair trade practices. We have taken the necessary steps to address this situation by petitioning the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to initiate antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. We look forward to the result of the ITC's preliminary vote later this week.  
Looking forward, we are very bullish about the next 2 years. As Bert will describe in a moment, the need to replenish global course grain stocks driving agricultural demand, along with the impact of increased economic activity driving industrial demand, should support all-time record global nitrogen demand over the next 2 years. Forward energy curves are also very favorable over this time frame. We expect these factors to help keep the global nitrogen supply and demand balance much tighter than we've seen in recent years, supporting an extended period of higher nitrogen pricing and higher margins for our cost advantage network.  
Longer term, we believe increased demand for ammonia and its clean energy attributes will become a significant factor in the tighter supply and demand balance, driving further value for our network. We continue to see broad interest in clean hydrogen and ammonia to help meet the world's clean energy needs. As we continue to have discussions with market participants, our focus remains on being at the forefront of this significant opportunity from positioning our network to be the world's leader for blue and green ammonia production, to collaborating with other global leaders where our unique capabilities can provide value. We are pleased with the progress we've made and look forward to additional developments in the coming months.  
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

The global nitrogen supply and demand balance remains far tighter than we have seen in recent years, underpinned by strong agricultural and industrial demand, plus higher energy prices in Europe and Asia. This has created a highly favorable",490,"Thanks, Tony. The global nitrogen supply and demand balance remains far tighter than we have seen in recent years, underpinned by strong agricultural and industrial demand, plus higher energy prices in Europe and Asia. This has created a highly favorable pricing environment that has persisted into the second half of this year. Based on the agriculture and energy outlook we see today, we believe a positive pricing environment for fertilizer will remain in place, at least into 2023.  
Strong global nitrogen demand is being led by the world's need to replenish course green stocks. The global course grain stock-to-use ratio was the lowest since 2012, entering this year's spring planting season. Commodity prices have risen significantly in response, and farmers are incentivized to maximize yield with fertilizer applications.  
Given this, we expect to see sustained demand in the second half, led by India and Brazil. We expect similar strengths from North America and Europe leading into the 2022 application season. We had a positive start to meeting this demand a few weeks ago when we launched our UAN fill program. We have built a solid order book for the third quarter at a NOL equivalent price of $285 per ton, though prices remain at a significant discount to urea for the reasons Tony mentioned. 
Further out, we expect that high demand for course grains, especially from China, will contribute to persistent low global stocks into next year. As a result, we believe that stocks will still need to be replenished, at least into 2023, supporting continued strong nitrogen demand.  
Increased economic activity is also driving higher global industrial demand for nitrogen. In North America, we have seen diesel exhaust fluid sales rise above pre-pandemic levels. Our first half DES sales were a company record, and we expect overall demand will continue to grow. We've also seen higher demand for ammonia and nitric acid from our industrial customers. Globally, industrial-related demand in China and from phosphate producers has also increased.  
While we expect demand to remain strong for some time, we believe that global fertilizer inventory in the channel today is low and will need to be rebuilt. So far, in 2021, high energy costs in Europe and Asia have lowered operating rates and reduced supply availability, particularly for ammonia and urea, further supporting global pricing.  
As you can see on Slide 9, energy costs in these regions have increased to over $14 per MMBtu, and Eastern European producers have become the global marginal producer for the time being. The higher energy costs has steepened the global nitrogen cost curve substantially, increasing margin opportunities for low-cost producers such as CF. Forward curve suggests CF will benefit from favorable energy differentials for the foreseeable future. As a result, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us as we leverage our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to deliver for our customers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $397 million or $1.83 per diluted share. EBITDA was $994 million, and adjusted EBITDA with $997 million. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $700 million. Based on the outlook Tony and Bert have shared, we are well positioned to build on these results and continue to generate significant free cash flow.  
I want to provide additional context to 2 items we covered in our press release. First, we raised our estimate for capital expenditures for 2021 from around $450 million to approximately $500 million. The increase is driven primarily by our decision to pull a significant maintenance event scheduled for next year into this year. We believe that performing this activity in 2021 is best for the asset and reduces the risk of an unplanned outage during the 2022 spring application season. Going forward, we expect capital expenditures to return to the range of $450 million per year.  
With this additional maintenance project, the high level of previously planned maintenance and the additional maintenance from severe weather in February, we estimate that gross ammonia production and sales volume will be around 9.5 million tons and 19 million product tons, respectively, both at the low end of our forecast earlier this year. Looking into 2022, we have a more typical maintenance schedule and would expect to return to approximately 10 million tons of ammonia production and sales volume of 19.5 million to 20 million product tons.  
Second, we are taking additional steps in line with our focus on achieving investment-grade ratings and positioning the company to execute our clean energy initiatives. We have announced that we will redeem $250 million of our senior notes due June 2023, which will reduce our gross debt to $3.5 billion. We expect to lower our gross debt to $3 billion by or before the maturity of the 2023 notes. We also continue to return cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases at attractive levels.  
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize everyone at CF for their strong work during the first half. They successfully managed many challenges in the first 6 months of the year, setting us up well for the second half. Most importantly, we did this safely with our recordable incident rate at the end of June at just 0.28 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages.  
As we look ahead, we expect strong agricultural and industrial demand to create all-time record global nitrogen demand. Forward curves show very favorable energy spreads to Europe and Asia over the same time frame, which should support robust margins and cash generation. We see good progress on our core synergy initiatives. Taken together, we are well positioned to create significant shareholder value in the near and longer term.  
With that, operator, we will now open the call to questions."

Obviously, we were disappointed with where UAN values were as a result of Russian and Trinidad dumped imports in the first half of the year.

And when we launched fill at $2.85 NOLA per UAN, that's a substantial uptick. And that's really the price environment that we're looking at in the third quarter and for the order book going forward. 
And then subsequently, we've been able to get a little bit of further appreciation off of the $285 number. So we're really pleased with how the order book is set up right now and what the back half of the year looks like. We've seen strong interest in ammonia for the fall already. Urea continues to trade in a reasonable spot. And as I said, UAN looks very good. So we're really excited about the second half.

So by getting investment grade, that senior secured drops off of that and allows us a little bit more activity. 
But I think really where your question is going is with return of capital and different things like that. I think what we see over the next several years here with free cash flow generation is we're really going to be able to reduce our debt to that gross target of $3 billion, invest in our clean energy initiatives specifically those that we've announced already and then additionally return cash to shareholders. So I think what we're seeing over the next couple of years will allow us to do all 3 of those."

And so even though it's taken out something that looks nominally like a fairly low interest rate is still better than what we're generating on the cash. 
And while you're certainly correct that the equity trades at a higher effective sort of overall cost to the business from a cash flow yield perspective, I think that by getting rid of some of this residual just sort of cost and drag on the business, having the flexibility that Chris talked about in terms of internal structuring of assets to optimize the tax consideration, all of those things are pretty important things for us to be able to do.

Based on the amount of turnaround activity and other maintenance work that was going on, we ended up with almost $60 million of sort of incremental maintenance and fixed cost write-off associated with the plants in Q2 versus last year. And then on top of that, we ended up with about $100 million that hits the cost of goods sold line through the first half of the year. That's based on purchased product for resale. And part of it was based on the commitments we have made to customers with the plant outages and the turnarounds. We needed to cover those positions and make sure we could provide reliable supply on our commitments. And so we went out and purchased both urea and ammonia to cover some of those requirements. 
And so in an average or in an otherwise kind of normalized year, you wouldn't see that $100 million hit the COGS line in that kind of way. And so those are sort of 2 big pieces that I'm thinking we won't have to the same magnitude second half.

P.J., on the cost of gas, what I'd say is more important than the absolute cost that we face is what the energy spread differential is. And so while last year, you saw very low gas costs, both in the U.S. and also in the U.K. You also saw global energy costs that were dramatically reduced, partly COVID-driven. And as a result, although our costs were low, our margin opportunity was also compressed because you saw really high operating rates. Right now what you see is energy cost differentials between the U.S. and Europe and Asia is like $10 or $11 per MMBtu. And so you see a huge margin differential between what the high-cost producers are running at and what our network runs at. 
And so as we think about it, despite the fact that our costs are going up, our margins are expanding much more rapidly than what our costs are going up, this is a great environment for us. In fact, I think -- and this is a chart that we'll likely be producing in the future. We've looked at this analysis that the higher the gas cost is in Henry Hub because the U.S. is such an important contributor into the LNG market, particularly on more of a spot basis, what you tend to see is higher energy differentials in LNG import regions. And as a result of that, there's typically margin expansion when our cost structures are -- is a little bit higher. This is a good thing for us instead of a headwind for us. But as we look forward, we tend to just believe in the forward energy, where the forward curve trades on the NYMEX and some of the other major pricing indices that we don't have a lot of additional insight over kind of where the market puts forward."

Yes, PJ, I agree with everything Tony just said. And maybe instead of looking at the overall COGS in total, it's the controllable COGS side that was really hit by maintenance because, as Tony mentioned, when we see expanded gas, sometimes that helps us even more from a pricing. So the controllable cost per ton, which generally runs in the mid-80s and is significantly higher than that over the first half of the year, we expect that to get back closer to the mid-80s when next year, as we mentioned, we'll be back to normalized operating rates of around 20 million product tons."

Because of COVID last year and us trying to protect our employees and minimize the number of contractors we had on site, we reduced it to just 2 major turnarounds last year, which is one of the reasons we set an all-time ammonia production record last year because we had fewer turnaround activities. This year, we've got 7 instead of 4. So the 2 that we were supposed to do last year that we moved forward, the 4 that were already scheduled for this year. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we're bringing 1 of them from next year backwards into this year to make sure that we've got reliable operation on that asset. 
In addition to being 7 instead of 4, 2 of the turnarounds were our major expansion plants. So our 2 biggest plants in the network, both the Donaldsonville 6 and Port Neal 2 ammonia plants. And those tend to be a little longer and a little more expensive than the rest of the network or the average-sized plants. This is the first time they've undergone a major turnaround. But our expectation as a result of this is that we're well positioned to be looking at potentially able to set an all-time production record next year for ammonia. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we got Port Neal 2 done this year. Because our view is as good as the pricing opportunity is right now, we think next year looks very strong as well, and we want to make sure we can run flat out.

And we're pleased with our -- I'd say very pleased with our order book going into Q3. As we exited Q2, and you can see from our information, that we had worked through our order book from the first half and entered into Q3 with very little orders on the books. We built a nice ammonia book for fall and the pricing -- the public pricing in there is the $600 to $640 at the terminal level. And then we launched the UAN fill program at that $285 NOLA and then stair stepped it up as we go through up through the Midwest and built a healthy order book for Q3 and now have looked at Q4 pricing. 
For urea, the market has kind of stayed in the range of $420 to $440 FOB NOLA, and then obviously, stair stepped up through the Midwest and into Canada. And so we have a healthy book on for all 3 products and look forward to, as Tony and Chris have both articulated through their comments and questions, we see just due to the structural nature of the global markets for grains and oilseeds and just some of the climatic difficulties that have taken place, both in the United States up from Midwest and Brazil and just low inventories, all these things coupled together, and low inventories of fertilizer, probably see a positive pricing environment for Q4 and into the next year. So we're anticipating a nice year."

It sounds like the engineering to capture and treat that carbon is pretty well understood and underway.

An",285,"Steve. Yes, currently, availability of Class 6 permanent geological sequestration is potentially the limiting factor, although there are opportunities to sequester CO2 tomorrow if we had the dehydration and compression in place on for EOR applications. And even for EOR, you are provided some level of the 45Q tax benefit from that. So it's not quite the full benefit, but it's available kind of now if we're ready. And that's one of the reasons we're pushing so quickly on dehydration of compression because we want to get that in place and really have that up and running, availing ourselves of the opportunity available now and be able to go immediately into injection wells when those permits are issued and they're ready to go. 
Relative to us wanting to get into that, that's not really our area of expertise. We're -- that's one of the areas where we look to other market participants and want to rely on their expertise. And there's a lot of subsurface geology and things that we just are not set up to do. And so instead of trying to replicate that, we want to kind of partner and work with other people that, that's their bread and butter. 
I would say there are a number of people that have come to us and said the geology within just a couple of miles of Donaldsonville is well situated for Class 6 permits, and they're going after those kinds of things. And so what we're talking about is, generally speaking, a pretty short haul run in order to get to them. And so that's very encouraging just in terms of what the overall time frame and cost structure looks like to do injection."

So the ones that we've announced, the green hydrogen/ammonia project, the Donaldsonville is in the range of $100 million. The dehydration and compression systems that we're looking at for CO2 in Donaldsonville, it's probably in the range of about $200 million. And that should be able to provide us with about 1 million tons of blue ammonia. And I think we can get there in 2 years or by the beginning of 2024. 
And then we're also looking at potentially a similar dehydration compression unit in Yazoo City, Mississippi, which should be able to provide us another, call it, 300,000, 250,000 to 300,000 tons of blue ammonia. And that would probably be in the $70 million to $80 million range. So the projects that we've announced so far are kind of sub-$400 million spread over the next 2 to 3 years. And based on the increased margin and cash flow that we're seeing from operations that's easily account -- taken care of just based on normal spending levels. Plus with the big slug of turnaround activity that we'll have in the rearview mirror here going next year back to more normalized rates, I think we're in a good position to be able to manage all of that. 
The thing that's exciting though is, as you mentioned, a couple of our announcements, both with the Singapore Port, Itochu consortium looking at ammonia as a marine fuel, which we think there's real legs to that and probably happening sooner than we initially thought, along with our Mitsui announcement around evaluating blue ammonia opportunities is there's a very likely a chance for us to potentially accelerate some of those opportunities and help this market develop more quickly. And so we're certainly interested in thinking about additional investments above and beyond. But I think, again, based on our enhanced free cash flow generation right now, we're not worried about being able to fund that. We feel that we're really in a great spot given our ability to leverage our existing asset base and get to blue and green ammonia much more both quickly and much more cheaply than other people can replicate that."

It's really, really strong. That helps take a little bit of the relief valve pressure off of the U.S. Gulf in terms of product trying to find liquidity out there. So I think that that's always a good thing. But given where soy prices are, and in fact, given what we view is going to be an increasing movement toward biodiesel and a lot of that coming from oilseeds, I think you'll see ongoing competition between the acre, whether it's soy or corn. And so I think all of this is good because on the one hand, what we don't want to see is a huge oversupply of corn acres driving a high stocks-to-use ratio and then you end up being depressed. So I think a nice, healthy balance where acres are being competed for is really good, particularly given the fact that now in -- as economic activity is picking back up after COVID, we're seeing all-time demand into the industrial sector for nitrogen products. And so we don't need to see huge increases in corn acres. In fact, that would be a bad thing for us.

And that's going to impact kind of that whole region. And it has, especially for shipping on the Paraná, the river there coming out of Argentina. And so what we're looking at is some structural changes that are taking place in Brazil with ethanol production, especially in the interior and then combined feeding, which is also consuming more feed grains. 
So when you look at the whole picture and what they're looking at in terms of it, it doesn't necessarily require more acres but just higher yields. Higher yields are driven by more nitrogen. So the combination of looking at what they're doing structurally in the interior and for exports, for higher-end protein production, all combined for a positive nitrogen environment for Brazil."

Our expectation is that if we get a favorable outcome, we would expect UAN to go back to the historical practice of trading at a premium to other upgraded nitrogen products. That's really where it should trade. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's both more capital intensive, and therefore, you need to earn an appropriate rate of return on that incremental capital investment to incent people to make that product. And it also has significant economic and operational efficiencies for farmers. And so because it's both good for the grower and its higher cost to produce, it ought to carry a premium, and that's where it was. And that's really where it should be in the absence of dumped tons. 
So that's where we think it goes to longer term. The U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity is sufficient to serve the U.S. demand. And so there's really no need for those imported, particularly the subsidized tons to show up over here. And so I think we're well positioned to satisfy U.S. demand. And what it does then is it just means we don't have to export those tons like we used to. In terms of overall timing on kind of when imports would stop showing up, I think that's a little bit TBD, but we're talking about relatively short term on that. In the event that it's not a favorable outcome, I think it's just business as usual because that's the world that we're living in currently. So it's not like there's downside to what today is that we're operating with all of those dumpy tons coming in today, and we're finding a way to navigate it despite the fact that it's challenging.

We have long-term relationships that are obviously decades-long but also kind of contractually laid out and some soft contractual commitments that we work very closely with our customers on supply. And so those who have been with us or against us in this case, we've been talking to and we'll continue to work with. And that's why we did a fill program in anticipation, just to  -- as a good faith that was appropriately priced based on the constraints of today, which, again, are high levels of imported subsidized product. But going forward, we will still work with our customers and be aligned with what is an appropriate price in the market and continue to communicate and support and help them grow their business, which in the long term, helps the American farmer and the American economy."

And so there certainly is some level of our business that is on a cost-plus basis. A lot of those contracts either come up every year, every couple of years for reevaluation. Then we think about what the market dynamics are from an S&D balance in terms of how much of that business we want to look at and what the -- how big the plus is in terms of the ad. Some of those contracts at various points in time were pretty attractive to us. Obviously, right now, the ammonia supply agreement with Mosaic is far in their favor. But for a number of years, it was a way in our favor. And that was a very helpful kind of contract when the rest of the business was under pressure to have enhanced margin coming out of that. 
So some of those end up being sort of a natural hedge for us, which isn't a bad thing at all. But it's certainly one of those things that Bert and his team evaluate how much and how high. And those are the things that will come probably under a little bit of pressure more than anything else as we see ammonia applications in clean energy beginning to expand. And so when we're able to make the blue ammonia that we're talking about earlier and are able to service the demand that will pay appropriate premiums for it, the place that's going to come out of is the relatively lower value industrial business that we serve today."

And I think that certainly, there has been some challenges in the interim during that period of time. But I also think we've done some things that make the company stronger today than it's ever been in the past. And if you look at how much cash flow we're generating today and how many shares that are outstanding, the ratio is better today than it was even back in the highest-priced days of the stock and/or the highest EBITDA that we were generating in the company's history. And so I think the sector may not be in that much favor right now in the marketplace, but I think the fundamentals of this business are better than they've ever been in the past. 
And I would also say we've taken out, I think, over 50 million shares out of our share count through repurchases, and it's probably even more than 50 million shares. And that actually has not theme to -- led to any kind of dramatic improvement. And so I'm not sure share repurchase is the answer. I think what really does drive value for investors in the near term, it's the fundamentals that we're looking at, which are better than anything we've seen in the last 7 or 8 years. And in the longer term, it is the fact that ammonia and hydrogen, I think, are really the clear clean energy sources of the future as economies decarbonize, and we're in the best position to capitalize on that. And as demand starts ramping up and exceeding supply, I think what you'll see is asset values will tend toward replacement costs, which is way above where they are today. And so it gives us the opportunity to think about how we want to participate in that marketplace, and it puts growth clearly back on the radar screen, whether that's inorganic or organic. 
But the fact of the matter is I firmly believe that you move the clock forward several years and ammonia is going to be in tight supply and people are going to be racing the need to build it. And when that happens, you see a dramatic uptick in terms of asset value. So we're very optimistic about the return profile that we offer to our investors."

So it's not easily available to go into the market and purchase UAN, so we chose to purchase urea and some ammonia and run UAN at a very high level to meet customer commitments. So across the board, on every product, we were able to deliver on time and even with the substantial disruption that took place in February and March. And so that's why you saw a volume uptick.

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first 9 months of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. These results reflect the drastically improving industry fundamentals that we experienced over the course of the year. 
Nitrogen prices are at their highest levels in over a decade as strong demand and lower worldwide production have tightened the global supply-demand balance considerably. At the same time, energy spreads between North America and high-cost regions have widened dramatically, supporting margin expansion for our cost advantage network. 
The CF team also continues to perform exceptionally well, navigating a couple of severe weather events in the U.S., our highest levels of turnaround and maintenance activity ever, and a challenging natural gas situation in the U.K. Most importantly, they did so safely. Our recordable incident rate at the end of September was just 0.24 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. These factors have driven substantial cash generation over the last year. Our trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $1 billion. As we look ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to build on this performance. 
We have good visibility into the fourth quarter of 2021. We have priced virtually all of our product shipments through the end of the year while also hedging our natural gas requirements. While there is always some uncertainty about the volume of ammonia that will be applied in Q4, given the dependency on weather, we would expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to land between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. 
Further out, we believe nitrogen industry conditions will remain positive for an extended period. As Bert will describe in a moment, we see very strong demand, constrained global supply and wide energy spreads between North America and Europe to persist for some time. These factors support our ability to continue to generate significant free cash and to deploy that capital to create shareholder value. 
Our priorities remain the same: invest in growth where opportunities offer returns above our cost of capital and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain focused on disciplined investments and are excited about the 2 new projects supporting our clean energy growth platform. Once completed, these projects will enable us to produce over 1 million tons of blue or carbon-free ammonia. Chris will share more about our announcement yesterday in a moment. 
We are also pleased to have achieved investment-grade credit ratings, which recognizes and underscores all of the work we have done to remove fixed costs in the business, reduce debt and highlights the positive industry fundamentals for a North American producer. 
On the balance sheet, we are quickly closing in on our target of $3 billion of gross debt and expect to repay the remaining $500 million outstanding on our 2023 notes on or before their maturity. However, that still leaves a substantial amount of excess free cash flow we expect to generate. And as such, the Board has authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program to facilitate the return of capital to shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and clean energy initiatives, before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

The last 6 to 9 months have seen a dramatic tightening of the global nitrogen supply and demand balance. High crop prices and increased economic activity continue to drive demand. Meanwhile, lower global production and government actions have created a supply constrained global market. The impact of this can be seen on Slides 11 and 12, where both our spot cost curve and 2022 cost curve are much higher and steeper than in recent years. As you can see, the margin opportunities available to our network have expanded greatly due to a widened energy spread between North America and marginal production in Europe. 
We expect strong global fertilizer demand to last into at least 2023. As you can see on Slide 8, global stocks-to-use ratios for both grains and oilseeds are at their lowest levels in nearly a decade, supporting high crop prices. These prices will support farm profitability in North America, even with higher input prices, incentivizing farmers to plant acres and maximize yield. Based on our order book, we expect the fall ammonia application season will be the largest since 2012, demonstrating farmer commitment to planting corn and applying fertilizer. 
We believe farmers around the world will make similar decisions, with import demand continuing to be led by India and Brazil. We believe global supply will remain constrained in the near term, with relief unlikely to appear anytime soon. We believe inventory in the channel is very low. Global production has been lower in 2021 due to severe weather in North America, higher maintenance worldwide, and ongoing European shutdowns and curtailments. Further, the Russian and Chinese governments are discouraging nitrogen fertilizer exports through the spring. These factors suggest the potential for strong fertilizer demand to last beyond 2023 even as some regions are unable to secure enough product in this supply-constrained environment, resulting in lower yields. If this were to happen, demand would be deferred into future years as it would take more than 2 growing seasons to replenish global grain and oilseed stocks. 
As we prepare for the spring application season, we continue to receive substantial interest for any product we offer into the marketplace. We are building a solid order book for the first quarter of 2022 at the prices you see in the market today. Similar to what we did for the fourth quarter, we are adding natural gas hedges as we make first quarter product commitments in order to lock in margin and protect against significant energy price spikes. 
As a result, we believe we're in a strong position heading into 2022. In this dynamic market, we remain focused on leveraging our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to serve our customers and look forward to the opportunities before us. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first 9 months of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $212 million or $0.98 per diluted share. EBITDA was $984 million and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.5 billion. Net earnings and EBITDA reflect the recognition of a noncash impairment charges related to our U.K. operations. As discussed in the earnings release, our results for the first 9 months and third quarter are preliminary pending the completion of the impairment analysis and finalization of the noncash impairment charges. 
We continue to monitor market conditions for the U.K. assets, which accounted for 2% of our gross margin in 2020. The Billingham complex is operating due to recently improved carbon dioxide contracts and industrial contracts that pass through natural gas costs. Operations at Ince remain halted. 
Free cash flow -- free cash generation remains strong. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $1 billion. We believe we have a good opportunity in 2022 to build on these results based not only on our positive outlook, but also on increased production from our network. 
In 2021, we completed a record level of maintenance activity that included turnarounds at 7 of our 17 ammonia plants. We will return to a more normal level of turnaround activity in 2022. As a result, we expect to return to our typical high ammonia utilization rates, with gross ammonia production between 9.5 million and 10 million tons. We expect to sell everything we produce and achieve sales volume between 19 million and 20 million tons in 2022. 
As we sell these product volumes into a favorable market environment, we expect to continue to generate substantial free cash flow and create shareholder value. As Tony said, our Board authorized the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which becomes effective January 1, 2022. We continue to operate under our existing program, which has enabled us to acquire more than 11 million shares to be repurchased since 2019. This program expires at the end of the year. 
At the same time, we'll continue to evaluate clean energy initiatives to meet the demand for ammonia's clean energy capabilities that we expect to emerge in the second half of the decade. This includes positioning our network for the production of blue and green ammonia to support the development of a market for low-carbon ammonia. Constructing carbon dioxide dehydration and compression units at Donaldsonville and Yard of the City are a necessary step to enable blue ammonia production through carbon capture and sequestration. These projects leverage our existing asset base and represented an efficient use of capital, with a return profile we expect to be above our cost of capital. Once sequestration is initiated, we'll be able to produce more than 1 million tons of blue ammonia annually while reducing our carbon emissions in a meaningful way. 
With our strong balance sheet, we also have the flexibility to evaluate additional opportunities in the years ahead. We continue to collaborate with global leaders where we can provide value, including jointly exploring with Mitsui the development of blue ammonia projects in the United States. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

We are excited about what lies ahead for CF Industries. In fact, I think the company is better positioned today than we have ever been in our history. We are again an investment-grade credit issuer. We have the fewest shares outstanding ever. We expect the business to produce between $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year. And as we look forward to next year, we should have significantly more tons to sell at overall average higher prices than this year. So the business should generate all-time records for free cash flow per share. We see demand for low-carbon ammonia developing that should provide a long-term growth platform for the company.

So this is more of a supply-constrained market. The demand is definitely there. You're seeing India desperately trying to pull in tons and will continue to do so through -- I expect into their next fertilizer year, which begins in April. Brazil is ahead 10% year-on-year and probably will continue at that pace through importing urea at least through February for their safrina. And then we hit our spring in the northern hemisphere. 
With what's going on in Europe with gas prices and the level of shutdown, there's over 11 million tons of ammonia that is currently not being upgraded into ammonia nitrate, urea or CAN. And so tons need to flow, which were not planned in the supply and demand scenario to Europe. So we were in a supply limited market, and that's what's going to keep prices elevated. 
The demand side of the equation is still very strong. And you're correct, what we sold for fall and we're applying today was sold at levels much lower than the current market, which is probably over $1,000 for ammonia. That being said, we're selling 1,000 ammonia for fall application on our incremental tons that are available, where, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're selling urea. And there is significant demand at that $730, $750 a short ton NOLA. It's even higher in the interior at over $800, which we've transacted at Port Neal. And you've seen in the publications the UAN reaction and the demand pulling. And I just looked at the analysis of where we are to date with order books and demand, and again, in a very good place at $550 UAN, calculating all that forward with current trend yield at 177 bushels per acre on the trend yield, that's not considering the I states, where you'll be 200 to 275 bushels. Even with rented land at today's economics, you're cash positive. You're actually profitable at a pretty healthy level. If you own your land, even more so. There are ways to economize. And so if you're a farmer, you can look at different options. But that's not going to come at the expense of nitrogen and probably even at fertilizer. It's going to come at some other issues. 
So we're constructively, as I said, positive. I would say, very positive. And the customer advances continue to come in. And so we're working with our retail partners to make sure that, that supply is available and our retail partners are buying that and moving -- there's going to be a substantial amount of cash coming into our retail friends through year-end as farmers prepare for 2022."

If you look at our customer advances, our order book is strong, you can continue to sell forward. And it looks like pharma economics are positive. But given the supply shortfall, particularly now with both Russia and China withholding tons from the export marketplace, there is a real shortage of nitrogen. And price has got to basically arbitrate. Who's going to get the scarce tons that are out there? And so it's not so much that you're going to destroy demand. There's going to be a lot of unmet demand that's going to be pent up. And so we do think yield is going to be on a global basis off next year. Again, not because demand destruction, just because there's not enough tons available. And what that means is it's going to promote favorable supply-demand dynamics in course grains as we get out into 2023 and probably beyond. So our view is that this is a very, very healthy dynamic that leads to a much longer period of positive fundamentals for our business."

So when you look at the Russia announcement, I would say in -- contextually, the Chinese announcement is much more significant, because of what has come out traditionally from China, the 4 million to 5 million tons of urea exports and also phosphates, that is going to have a -- because that's the incremental ton that is continually bid in. So in a world of 50 million tons of world traded urea, to take out up to 10% is going to be felt, on top of the demand, as I mentioned earlier, from Europe that needs to move. So you're going to see North African tons moving into Europe. And there's going to be a hole. Like Tony said, somebody is going to have to struggle or pay up. 
The Russia announcement was a little bit of a surprise. The Russian demand for nitrogen fertilizers has been fairly consistent in that 5.5 million to 6.5 million tons demand per year. And they've exported the remainder. And so when you look at from year-on-year what Russia has consumed and what Russia has exported, on the margin, there's probably going to be a shortage of up to 0.5 million tons. So Brazil will be able to get their ammonium nitrate. And I believe the suppliers from Russia, Eurocaron and the others will do that, as well as supply -- some of the portion that's needed in Europe. So it's going to come again on the margin. And every month, there'll be less tons available from an expected source, which further exacerbates this supply-demand imbalance that we've been discussing."

I think when you look at the economics, Steve, both at D ville and Yazoo City, given what's been proposed from the 45Q tax incentive, it allows us to not only more than fund those particular capital expenditures, but also see a return above our cost of capital. And the reason for that is you know better than a lot of people do is because we're already capturing the CO2 off of our ammonia process today. So that equipment is already in place, and that's limited the amount of CapEx that we had need, and therefore, increases our return profile on that."

And so at a minimum, I would say, you're able to get whatever prevailing value of carbon is on top of a regular sort of traded ton. 
And as Chris highlighted, if you think about the total variable cost required to produce a ton of blue ammonia, we probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 to $10 a ton of electricity cost on plant site. And then we're in pretty advanced discussions with a number of potential parties on the transport and injection, and believe that, that is a very manageable number from an overall cost standpoint. And so the all-in -- the variable cost that we incur is less than the value of the 45Q credit. And so the differential will go toward paying back the capital even before you put any premium on blue ammonia. So just on the value of the 45Q, we feel comfortable that we'll get returns above our cost of capital.

We did lose some tons, but we are moving our tons into the market. We have a record number of UAN tows in service since I've been here.

And I think as you point out, there are a lot of competing priorities out there that have second order and tertiary kind of knock-on effects that not everyone understands well. 
So the push to reduce availability and affordability of fossil fuels because of a focus on climate change and move towards renewable, I think, is directly part of what's going on in Europe right now with extremely high natural gas costs. And that means that all of those plants that Bert talked about earlier curtailed or off-line. At the same time, you've got a number of governments around the world that are very focused on trying to limit rate of nitrogen fertilizer in particular because they're concerned about nutrient loss to the environment and runoff. And whether it's nitrous oxide produced on the field that -- it's pretty potent greenhouse gas or whether it's other kinds of runoff into waterways and so forth, there's a real push in some areas, Canada notably, and other places as well to reduce application rate. And if you do that, you're going to have a year 1 impact on yield. 
So there are a number of, I would say, competing priorities out there. All of which, generally speaking, I would say, benefit North American producers because we do have ready access to low-cost gas. We're on the very low end of the supply curve. And as yields continue to struggle due to either lack of availability of nutrients or are these programs designed to reduce nutrient application, that's just going to keep grain prices higher for longer. 
I mean, ultimately, I think where this goes is governments are going to have to capitulate to the requirements of their people and provide affordable food, which means some of those priorities that they have heretofore held out as being these holy grails are going to probably have to take a back seat for a while just to make sure that we can feed the people of the world. But I think that you will see people backing off. 
I mean, again, Germany has decommissioned their nukes, and they've brought on coal-fired power plants. That's not exactly what I would call a green initiative. You've seen the same thing in China as well. And the U.K. and Continental Europe are struggling with high gas costs. So I do think there is going to have to be a reassessment of what is required to -- for the planet to be able to eat and fuel itself."

So as Chris mentioned, and we've highlighted earlier, we do have this MOU in place with Mitsui. We're having very productive conversations with them. I think there is a real emphasis, particularly in Japan, but in some other regions as well to go into co-combustion of ammonia with coal to reduce the CO2 emissions out of those plants. And we think that, that is something that will develop into a pretty sizable market. Estimates can be as much as 5 million tons by the time you get to 2030 or possibly even before. And that's a huge increase in terms of the total amount of ammonia being consumed, particularly when you've got curtailments and outages in -- across broad swaths of the production universe here in Europe and the U.K. 
And so we're excited about the clean energy attributes that blue ammonia has. We think that that's probably where the majority of value sits at least in the near term. While I think there is certainly the possibility to get some incremental value off of carbon sequestration in the soils from an agricultural application, given that most of that is going into the voluntary marketplace today where values trade at a pretty small discount to where structured carbon trades in the rest of the world, I think that's probably the last place just because of lower values that we would go. 
Now if the U.S. develops a more structured approach to the cost of carbon, and you can get a scientific valuation placed on carbon capture and sequestration in the soil, then that may change the math. But I think in the near term, what we're really looking at is more of a clean energy source. And we're working very closely with Mitsui to help develop that and bring that about. 
The other point though that I would say is, we believe these projects are attractive just based on the 45Q credit, that we ought to be able to generate a return on these projects without any embedded premium on blue. Now our expectation is there's going to be a sizable premium on blue. But to be clear, we're able to make the math work pretty easily just with the 45Q credit."

And that was an inappropriate response to a more -- a valued product, an expensive invested product and an asset base, we've invested several billion dollars to maintain and construct. So we're entering probably a normalized market now where UAN, again, is trading at a premium to urea for the reasons I just articulated, and it should. 
So through spring, most definitely, it will trade at a premium. We'll reset in July as we always do. We believe at a higher level. For the reasons we have articulated, we are in a different -- or a differentiated global market, driven by a lack of supply, with high levels of demand that is not going to correct itself probably for a couple more years. And so in that context, we see UAN trading at a advantaged position to urea as well as ammonia and ammonium nitrate. And that market, we don't see demand destruction. We just see differences of supply availability."

So where you're looking at export trends, I would look at the Chinese economy holistically. And looking at what they're trying to do with energy and where they are, you've got the risk of entering winter, and ground may not be able to have heat in some of these big cities. Are you going to value the urea production? Or are you going to value the population and the ability to heat homes and to produce value-added products or a commodity product? I would bet on the latter than the former. And so -- or the former rather than the latter. There you go. 
And so what we're seeing in China is a result of several factors coming to play, whether that's pollution, economically-driven decisions, higher -- polluting level product -- or production taken offline and then this restriction to have products available. You've seen their production capacity -- full status capacity fall from 90 million tons at its peak to probably 75 million tons today. And then you take an operating rate that's ranged from 55% to 75%. In China, you only have available probably 53 million to 55 million tons of urea per year. Domestic consumption has rebounded and is over 50 million tons. So there is not that substantial amount of tonnage to export. And why export a value-destructive product? That's where we see the future of China. And other production is going to have to come on stream in other locales. So you have Nigeria coming up, Russia coming up. We need more. And so more construction will probably take place, but it's long dated. So you're not going to see this market correct for the arrival of new production, even though we need it."

And so our expectation is that there's going to be availability of product here in North America. And honestly, I don't see a scenario where industrial demand starts backing off based on ag demand. I see a situation where you end up with inflation in terms of the industrial goods as opposed to some reduction in economic output. 
But I think ultimately, as Bert talked about, you see some new projects on the drawing board, but not very many, and particularly not enough with respect to some of the closures and shutdowns or even curtailments that you see out there right now. So ultimately, I think what's going to have to happen is you end up seeing more capacity added because the world just needs more than what's available. That's before you even get to clean energy applications for ammonia going forward. 
So I think the net of all of that suggests that there are new plants that the world is going to need to construct in order to be able to feed itself and utilize ammonia and these kind of new alternative applications versus what we've seen in the past."

We have the capability to construct and move with the infrastructure that's in place, whether that be rail, barge, truck, pipe. And we are set up to do that very efficiently. 
So what I can see over time is these other economies progress into lower carbon output -- or lower carbon consumption using natural gas or renewables. You're going to see the natural gas spreads continue to expand or stay expanded. Maybe not at its current level today of $20 per MMBtu, but maybe it's $10 rather than $6. And that maintains North America as a low-cost, high-margin region in the world. And I think you'll see maybe some industrial production in other areas compromised, that would be Europe, and maybe some even in China over time as we move to a new market. 
On the corn to soybean competition, today, it's favoring corn, and it has been. And this is the time when it makes sense. And when it's very good for us to have that favorability because that's when today or in this period is when farmers are making that spring planting decision and allocating their resources accordingly, and therefore, booking fertilizer, which is positive for us. We're seeing very strong industrial demand in our book. And we balance both of those, we think, well as well as our industry. So I think it's a net positive."

So remember, $20 to $30, that might be in the range or it might be a little high relative to our expectations. But that's not a crazy number. Remember, the 45Q tax credit, the way that it was originally constructed was going to be sort of $45-ish to $50. In the current regs, it's substantially above that, right? So although it's a little bit more expensive for us to make, if you net against it the 45Q tax credit, it's actually a discount relative to conventional ammonia from a producer side. 
But the reason why a grower would pay for it is, if they want to be able to make carbon labeling claims that go into consumer products companies, because they're going to care about that, or if you're trying to produce low-carbon ethanol that might be qualified for California's clean fuel standards, that might be a reason for it. Or even in the voluntary market, if you can get $5 to $10 a ton for sequestering carbon in the soil. Being a grower, there were a couple of high-profile transactions that happened along those lines a couple of months ago. I think there's a lot of value there potentially for growers to try to differentiate what they're doing versus just a commodity, bushel or corn. And so based on kind of where some of those pockets of value are, we would expect there to be some margin opportunity for us or at least some incremental demand for that product. And again, to the extent that the U.S. actually adopts a more regulated and structured cost of carbon, then there's real economics available to the farmer if they can demonstrate the sequestration and sell those credits into a structured marketplace, so."

So the first thing that I want to just highlight is the relative importance of the U.K. in terms of the overall portfolio. As Chris mentioned, if you look back to our results in 2020, it represented 2% of our total gross margin. So from an aggregate profitability standpoint, it's on the small end of the scale. Now it does provide a little bit of a natural hedge for us. When global energy costs are low and relatively flat, then we earn a better return there. When energy costs are high, we earn a much better return in the U.S. on a larger production base. So it's a little bit of a kind of a natural hedge in that regard. 
But as you mentioned, because of a huge spike in gas cost in September, we took the plants off-line. We worked, I would say, very constructively with the U.K. government to restart the facility at Billingham and be able to provide CO2 into the U.K. marketplace. That's pretty critical for the normal functioning of a number of different industries over there. And during that period of time, the U.K. government also is very helpful in us, working with us, and the CO2 offtake companies, the industrial gas companies from Billingham to restructure those contracts in a way that makes that plant viable. 
So we're really pleased with how that whole process developed. And the Billingham implant is up and operational, and we expect that to be viable in the long term. The Ince plant in the Northwest is not yet back online. We're evaluating a number of different options and scenarios. They are including being able to secure a vessel to bring ammonia into the facility so we can at a minimum run the upgrade plants. Given, again, the high cost of natural gas through the winter, it doesn't look like ammonia production there is going to make a lot of sense. But being able to bring in ammonia will allow us to run the upgrades and make an appropriate return on those products. 
So we're kind of in a little bit of a wait-and-see mode in terms of what the longer range situation develops in the U.K. But I think for now, Billingham is up and operational. We expect that to happen. And again, we expect to be able to turn the back end of the fertilizer portion of the plant up and running. And Ince, hopefully, soon, within the next couple of weeks once we get the ammonia vessel squared away."

Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the first 9 months of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. These results reflect the drastically improving industry fundamentals that we experienced over the course of the year.
Nitrogen prices are at their highest levels in over a decade as strong demand and lower worldwide production have tightened the global supply-demand balance considerably. At the same time, energy spreads between North America and high-cost regions have widened dramatically, supporting margin expansion for our cost advantage network.
The CF team also continues to perform exceptionally well, navigating a couple of severe weather events in the U.S., our highest levels of turnaround and maintenance activity ever, and a challenging natural gas situation in the U.K. Most importantly, they did so safely. Our recordable incident rate at the end of September was just 0.24 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. These factors have driven substantial cash generation over the last year. Our trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $1 billion. As we look ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to build on this performance.
We have good visibility into the fourth quarter of 2021. We have priced virtually all of our product shipments through the end of the year while also hedging our natural gas requirements. While there is always some uncertainty about the volume of ammonia that will be applied in Q4, given the dependency on weather, we would expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to land between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion.
Further out, we believe nitrogen industry conditions will remain positive for an extended period. As Bert will describe in a moment, we see very strong demand, constrained global supply and wide energy spreads between North America and Europe to persist for some time. These factors support our ability to continue to generate significant free cash and to deploy that capital to create shareholder value.
Our priorities remain the same: invest in growth where opportunities offer returns above our cost of capital and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain focused on disciplined investments and are excited about the 2 new projects supporting our clean energy growth platform. Once completed, these projects will enable us to produce over 1 million tons of blue or carbon-free ammonia. Chris will share more about our announcement yesterday in a moment.
We are also pleased to have achieved investment-grade credit ratings, which recognizes and underscores all of the work we have done to remove fixed costs in the business, reduce debt and highlights the positive industry fundamentals for a North American producer.
On the balance sheet, we are quickly closing in on our target of $3 billion of gross debt and expect to repay the remaining $500 million outstanding on our 2023 notes on or before their maturity. However, that still leaves a substantial amount of excess free cash flow we expect to generate. And as such, the Board has authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program to facilitate the return of capital to shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and clean energy initiatives, before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

The last 6 to 9 months have seen a dramatic tightening of the global nitrogen supply and demand balance. High crop prices and increased economic activity continue to drive demand. Meanwhile, lower global production and government actions have created a supply constrained global market. The impact of this can be seen on Slides 11 and 12, where both our spot cost curve and 2022 cost curve are much higher and steeper than in recent years. As you can see, the margin opportunities available to our network have expanded greatly due to a widened energy spread between North America and marginal production in Europe.
We expect strong global fertilizer demand to last into at least 2023. As you can see on Slide 8, global stocks-to-use ratios for both grains and oilseeds are at their lowest levels in nearly a decade, supporting high crop prices. These prices will support farm profitability in North America, even with higher input prices, incentivizing farmers to plant acres and maximize yield. Based on our order book, we expect the fall ammonia application season will be the largest since 2012, demonstrating farmer commitment to planting corn and applying fertilizer.
We believe farmers around the world will make similar decisions, with import demand continuing to be led by India and Brazil. We believe global supply will remain constrained in the near term, with relief unlikely to appear anytime soon. We believe inventory in the channel is very low.
Global production has been lower in 2021 due to severe weather in North America, higher maintenance worldwide, and ongoing European shutdowns and curtailments. Further, the Russian and Chinese governments are discouraging nitrogen fertilizer exports through the spring. These factors suggest the potential for strong fertilizer demand to last beyond 2023 even as some regions are unable to secure enough product in this supply-constrained environment, resulting in lower yields. If this were to happen, demand would be deferred into future years as it would take more than 2 growing seasons to replenish global grain and oilseed stocks.
As we prepare for the spring application season, we continue to receive substantial interest for any product we offer into the marketplace. We are building a solid order book for the first quarter of 2022 at the prices you see in the market today. Similar to what we did for the fourth quarter, we are adding natural gas hedges as we make first quarter product commitments in order to lock in margin and protect against significant energy price spikes.
As a result, we believe we're in a strong position heading into 2022. In this dynamic market, we remain focused on leveraging our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to serve our customers and look forward to the opportunities before us.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first 9 months of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $212 million or $0.98 per diluted share. EBITDA was $984 million and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.5 billion. Net earnings and EBITDA reflect the recognition of a noncash impairment charges related to our U.K. operations. As discussed in the earnings release, our results for the first 9 months and third quarter are preliminary pending the completion of the impairment analysis and finalization of the noncash impairment charges.
We continue to monitor market conditions for the U.K. assets, which accounted for 2% of our gross margin in 2020. The Billingham complex is operating due to recently improved carbon dioxide contracts and industrial contracts that pass through natural gas costs. Operations at Ince remain halted.
Free cash flow -- free cash generation remains strong. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $1 billion. We believe we have a good opportunity in 2022 to build on these results based not only on our positive outlook, but also on increased production from our network.
In 2021, we completed a record level of maintenance activity that included turnarounds at 7 of our 17 ammonia plants. We will return to a more normal level of turnaround activity in 2022. As a result, we expect to return to our typical high ammonia utilization rates, with gross ammonia production between 9.5 million and 10 million tons. We expect to sell everything we produce and achieve sales volume between 19 million and 20 million tons in 2022.
As we sell these product volumes into a favorable market environment, we expect to continue to generate substantial free cash flow and create shareholder value. As Tony said, our Board authorized the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which becomes effective January 1, 2022. We continue to operate under our existing program, which has enabled us to acquire more than 11 million shares to be repurchased since 2019. This program expires at the end of the year.
At the same time, we'll continue to evaluate clean energy initiatives to meet the demand for ammonia's clean energy capabilities that we expect to emerge in the second half of the decade. This includes positioning our network for the production of blue and green ammonia to support the development of a market for low-carbon ammonia. Constructing carbon dioxide dehydration and compression units at Donaldsonville and Yard of the City are a necessary step to enable blue ammonia production through carbon capture and sequestration. These projects leverage our existing asset base and represented an efficient use of capital, with a return profile we expect to be above our cost of capital. Once sequestration is initiated, we'll be able to produce more than 1 million tons of blue ammonia annually while reducing our carbon emissions in a meaningful way.
With our strong balance sheet, we also have the flexibility to evaluate additional opportunities in the years ahead. We continue to collaborate with global leaders where we can provide value, including jointly exploring with Mitsui the development of blue ammonia projects in the United States.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize our team here at CF for their strong work so far in 2021. Their commitment and dedication continue to be the foundation of our success.
We are excited about what lies ahead for CF Industries. In fact, I think the company is better positioned today than we have ever been in our history. We are again an investment-grade credit issuer. We have the fewest shares outstanding ever. We expect the business to produce between $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year. And as we look forward to next year, we should have significantly more tons to sell at overall average higher prices than this year. So the business should generate all-time records for free cash flow per share. We see demand for low-carbon ammonia developing that should provide a long-term growth platform for the company. And with our investments in both green and blue ammonia production, we will be at the forefront of this exciting opportunity. Taken together, we have never been in a better position to create value for shareholders.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."

I mean you talked about record demand for ammonia in the fall. Those prices were also booked several hundred dollars ago relative to where the spot market is. And so as you think about the order patterns into the first quarter, do you see any risks on farmers and their application rates? And obviously, nitrogen is less discretionary, but do you think that could have any impact on economic yield given where affordability is today?"

So this is more of a supply-constrained market. The demand is definitely there. You're seeing India desperately trying to pull in tons and will continue to do so through -- I expect into their next fertilizer year, which begins in April. Brazil is ahead 10% year-on-year and probably will continue at that pace through importing urea at least through February for their safrina. And then we hit our spring in the northern hemisphere. 
With what's going on in Europe with gas prices and the level of shutdown, there's over 11 million tons of ammonia that is currently not being upgraded into ammonia nitrate, urea or CAN. And so tons need to flow, which were not planned in the supply and demand scenario to Europe. So we were in a supply limited market, and that's what's going to keep prices elevated. 
The demand side of the equation is still very strong. And you're correct, what we sold for fall and we're applying today was sold at levels much lower than the current market, which is probably over $1,000 for ammonia. That being said, we're selling $1,000 ammonia for fall application on our incremental tons that are available, where, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're selling urea. And there is significant demand at that $730, $750 a short ton NOLA. It's even higher in the interior at over $800, which we've transacted at Port Neal. And you've seen in the publications the UAN reaction and the demand pulling. And I just looked at the analysis of where we are to date with order books and demand, and again, in a very good place at $550 UAN, calculating all that forward with current trend yield at 177 bushels per acre on the trend yield, that's not considering the I states, where you'll be 200 to 275 bushels. Even with rented land at today's economics, you're cash positive. You're actually profitable at a pretty healthy level. If you own your land, even more so. There are ways to economize. And so if you're a farmer, you can look at different options. But that's not going to come at the expense of nitrogen and probably even at fertilizer. It's going to come at some other issues. 
So we're constructively, as I said, positive. I would say, very positive. And the customer advances continue to come in. And so we're working with our retail partners to make sure that, that supply is available and our retail partners are buying that and moving -- there's going to be a substantial amount of cash coming into our retail friends through year-end as farmers prepare for 2022."

If you look at our customer advances, our order book is strong, you can continue to sell forward. And it looks like farmer economics are positive. But given the supply shortfall, particularly now with both Russia and China withholding tons from the export marketplace, there is a real shortage of nitrogen. And price has got to basically arbitrate. Who's going to get the scarce tons that are out there? And so it's not so much that you're going to destroy demand. There's going to be a lot of unmet demand that's going to be pent up. And so we do think yield is going to be on a global basis off next year. Again, not because demand destruction, just because there's not enough tons available. And what that means is it's going to promote favorable supply-demand dynamics in course grains as we get out into 2023 and probably beyond.
So our view is that this is a very, very healthy dynamic that leads to a much longer period of positive fundamentals for our business."

So when you look at the Russia announcement, I would say in -- contextually, the Chinese announcement is much more significant, because of what has come out traditionally from China, the 4 million to 5 million tons of urea exports and also phosphates, that is going to have a -- because that's the incremental ton that is continually bid in. So in a world of 50 million tons of world traded urea, to take out up to 10% is going to be felt, on top of the demand, as I mentioned earlier, from Europe that needs to move. So you're going to see North African tons moving into Europe. And there's going to be a hole. Like Tony said, somebody is going to have to struggle or pay up.
The Russia announcement was a little bit of a surprise. The Russian demand for nitrogen fertilizers has been fairly consistent in that 5.5 million to 6.5 million tons demand per year. And they've exported the remainder. And so when you look at from year-on-year what Russia has consumed and what Russia has exported, on the margin, there's probably going to be a shortage of up to 0.5 million tons. So Brazil will be able to get their ammonium nitrate. And I believe the suppliers from Russia, EuroChem, Acron and the others will do that, as well as supply -- some of the portion that's needed in Europe. So it's going to come again on the margin. And every month, there'll be less tons available from an expected source, which further exacerbates this supply-demand imbalance that we've been discussing."

I think when you look at the economics, Steve, both at D'ville and Yazoo City, given what's been proposed from the 45Q tax incentive, it allows us to not only more than fund those particular capital expenditures, but also see a return above our cost of capital. And the reason for that is you know better than a lot of people do is because we're already capturing the CO2 off of our ammonia process today.

The other thing that makes Yazoo attractive, as Chris said, is a lot of excess CO2, it's very close to existing CO2 pipeline capacity with Denbury and there's a lot of options in the area. The geology there is really attractive. So Yazoo was an obvious add-on with the D'ville project."

So in Europe, you're talking about EUR 50 or above a ton. In the U.K., it's more like GBP 50. Other regions are going to have different cost structures from a regulatory environment. And so at a minimum, I would say, you're able to get whatever prevailing value of carbon is on top of a regular sort of traded ton.
And as Chris highlighted, if you think about the total variable cost required to produce a ton of blue ammonia, we probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 to $10 a ton of electricity cost on plant site. And then we're in pretty advanced discussions with a number of potential parties on the transport and injection, and believe that, that is a very manageable number from an overall cost standpoint. And so the all-in -- the variable cost that we incur is less than the value of the 45Q credit. And so the differential will go toward paying back the capital even before you put any premium on blue ammonia. So just on the value of the 45Q, we feel comfortable that we'll get returns above our cost of capital. And then to the extent you're able to realize margins and additional premium on blue, that just further adds to the attractiveness of this investment for us."

They have tons available to sell. We're producing record amounts of UAN. And you can see with some of the disruptions from the hurricane and weather problems. We did lose some tons, but we are moving our tons into the market. We have a record number of UAN tows in service since I've been here. And as well, none of our railcars are in storage, which is the first time since I've been here in 13 years that all of our railcars are occupied.
So product is moving to market. Product is available. Now that being said, CF is not pricing Q2 as of yet, and that's a pricing position. That's not a volume nor a commitment situation. So I believe if retailers wanted to take that out or a farmer wanted to get a quote or an offer, that should be available in the market.

And now we've had this spike in gas and coal prices and so forth. And we're having a lot of food inflation. And Bert laid out a very plausible scenario where we could have lower yields because of the inability of everybody to get nitrogen and so forth.
So what do you think the global response to this is going to be over time in terms of trying to manage the food supply and make sure that we kind of don't get into extreme situations like this into perpetuity? But at the same time, we need to balance our sort of climate goals and our green energy aspirations and so forth. So how does this needle get thread in your view?"

Vince, it's a great question. And I think as you point out, there are a lot of competing priorities out there that have second order and tertiary kind of knock-on effects that not everyone understands well.
So the push to reduce availability and affordability of fossil fuels because of a focus on climate change and move towards renewable, I think, is directly part of what's going on in Europe right now with extremely high natural gas costs. And that means that all of those plants that Bert talked about earlier curtailed or off-line. At the same time, you've got a number of governments around the world that are very focused on trying to limit rate of nitrogen fertilizer in particular because they're concerned about nutrient loss to the environment and runoff. And whether it's nitrous oxide produced on the field that -- it's pretty potent greenhouse gas or whether it's other kinds of runoff into waterways and so forth, there's a real push in some areas, Canada notably, and other places as well to reduce application rate. And if you do that, you're going to have a year 1 impact on yield.
So there are a number of, I would say, competing priorities out there. All of which, generally speaking, I would say, benefit North American producers because we do have ready access to low-cost gas. We're on the very low end of the supply curve. And as yields continue to struggle due to either lack of availability of nutrients or are these programs designed to reduce nutrient application, that's just going to keep grain prices higher for longer.
I mean, ultimately, I think where this goes is governments are going to have to capitulate to the requirements of their people and provide affordable food, which means some of those priorities that they have heretofore held out as being these holy grails are going to probably have to take a back seat for a while just to make sure that we can feed the people of the world. But I think that you will see people backing off.
I mean, again, Germany has decommissioned their nukes, and they've brought on coal-fired power plants. That's not exactly what I would call a green initiative. You've seen the same thing in China as well. And the U.K. and Continental Europe are struggling with high gas costs. So I do think there is going to have to be a reassessment of what is required to -- for the planet to be able to eat and fuel itself."

So as Chris mentioned, and we've highlighted earlier, we do have this MOU in place with Mitsui. We're having very productive conversations with them. I think there is a real emphasis, particularly in Japan, but in some other regions as well to go into co-combustion of ammonia with coal to reduce the CO2 emissions out of those plants. And we think that, that is something that will develop into a pretty sizable market. Estimates can be as much as 5 million tons by the time you get to 2030 or possibly even before. And that's a huge increase in terms of the total amount of ammonia being consumed, particularly when you've got curtailments and outages in -- across broad swaths of the production universe here in Europe and the U.K.
And so we're excited about the clean energy attributes that blue ammonia has. We think that that's probably where the majority of value sits at least in the near term. While I think there is certainly the possibility to get some incremental value off of carbon sequestration in the soils from an agricultural application, given that most of that is going into the voluntary marketplace today where values trade at a pretty small discount to where structured carbon trades in the rest of the world, I think that's probably the last place just because of lower values that we would go.
Now if the U.S. develops a more structured approach to the cost of carbon, and you can get a scientific valuation placed on carbon capture and sequestration in the soil, then that may change the math. But I think in the near term, what we're really looking at is more of a clean energy source. And we're working very closely with Mitsui to help develop that and bring that about.
The other point though that I would say is, we believe these projects are attractive just based on the 45Q credit, that we ought to be able to generate a return on these projects without any embedded premium on blue. Now our expectation is there's going to be a sizable premium on blue. But to be clear, we're able to make the math work pretty easily just with the 45Q credit."

And therefore, we took the case forward to the Department of Commerce and the ITC, and we're successful. We're pleased with that result. And we believe that, that information will come out with what the ruling will be and how that will be applied, step 1.
And so the discount to urea took place for several years. And that was an inappropriate response to a more -- a valued product, an expensive invested product and an asset base, we've invested several billion dollars to maintain and construct. So we're entering probably a normalized market now where UAN, again, is trading at a premium to urea for the reasons I just articulated, and it should. 
So through spring, most definitely, it will trade at a premium. We'll reset in July as we always do. We believe at a higher level. For the reasons we have articulated, we are in a different -- or a differentiated global market, driven by a lack of supply, with high levels of demand that is not going to correct itself probably for a couple more years. And so in that context, we see UAN trading at a advantaged position to urea as well as ammonia and ammonium nitrate. And that market, we don't see demand destruction.

So where you're looking at export trends, I would look at the Chinese economy holistically. And looking at what they're trying to do with energy and where they are, you've got the risk of entering winter, and ground may not be able to have heat in some of these big cities. Are you going to value the urea production? Or are you going to value the population and the ability to heat homes and to produce value-added products or a commodity product? I would bet on the latter than the former. And so -- or the former rather than the latter. There you go.
And so what we're seeing in China is a result of several factors coming to play, whether that's pollution, economically-driven decisions, higher -- polluting level product -- or production taken offline and then this restriction to have products available. You've seen their production capacity -- full status capacity fall from 90 million tons at its peak to probably 75 million tons today. And then you take an operating rate that's ranged from 55% to 75%. In China, you only have available probably 53 million to 55 million tons of urea per year. Domestic consumption has rebounded and is over 50 million tons. So there is not that substantial amount of tonnage to export. And why export a value-destructive product? That's where we see the future of China. And other production is going to have to come on stream in other locales. So you have Nigeria coming up, Russia coming up. We need more. And so more construction will probably take place, but it's long dated. So you're not going to see this market correct for the arrival of new production, even though we need it."

I see a situation where you end up with inflation in terms of the industrial goods as opposed to some reduction in economic output.
But I think ultimately, as Bert talked about, you see some new projects on the drawing board, but not very many, and particularly not enough with respect to some of the closures and shutdowns or even curtailments that you see out there right now. So ultimately, I think what's going to have to happen is you end up seeing more capacity added because the world just needs more than what's available. That's before you even get to clean energy applications for ammonia going forward.
So I think the net of all of that suggests that there are new plants that the world is going to need to construct in order to be able to feed itself and utilize ammonia and these kind of new alternative applications versus what we've seen in the past."

We have the capability to construct and move with the infrastructure that's in place, whether that be rail, barge, truck, pipe. And we are set up to do that very efficiently.
So what I can see over time is these other economies progress into lower carbon output -- or lower carbon consumption using natural gas or renewables. You're going to see the natural gas spreads continue to expand or stay expanded. Maybe not at its current level today of $20 per MMBtu, but maybe it's $10 rather than $6. And that maintains North America as a low-cost, high-margin region in the world. And I think you'll see maybe some industrial production in other areas compromised, that would be Europe, and maybe some even in China over time as we move to a new market.
On the corn to soybean competition, today, it's favoring corn, and it has been. And this is the time when it makes sense. And when it's very good for us to have that favorability because that's when today or in this period is when farmers are making that spring planting decision and allocating their resources accordingly, and therefore, booking fertilizer, which is positive for us. We're seeing very strong industrial demand in our book. And we balance both of those, we think, well as well as our industry. So I think it's a net positive."

Remember, the 45Q tax credit, the way that it was originally constructed was going to be sort of $45-ish to $50. In the current regs, it's substantially above that, right? So although it's a little bit more expensive for us to make, if you net against it the 45Q tax credit, it's actually a discount relative to conventional ammonia from a producer side.
But the reason why a grower would pay for it is, if they want to be able to make carbon labeling claims that go into consumer products companies, because they're going to care about that, or if you're trying to produce low-carbon ethanol that might be qualified for California's clean fuel standards, that might be a reason for it. Or even in the voluntary market, if you can get $5 to $10 a ton for sequestering carbon in the soil. Being a grower, there were a couple of high-profile transactions that happened along those lines a couple of months ago. I think there's a lot of value there potentially for growers to try to differentiate what they're doing versus just a commodity, bushel or corn. And so based on kind of where some of those pockets of value are, we would expect there to be some margin opportunity for us or at least some incremental demand for that product. And again, to the extent that the U.S. actually adopts a more regulated and structured cost of carbon, then there's real economics available to the farmer if they can demonstrate the sequestration and sell those credits into a structured marketplace, so."

And then you guys were -- reached an agreement with the government to restart it. When you talked about getting back to that kind of 19.5 million to 20 million ton, the implication, I assume there is that those plants are going to run full next year. So maybe you could just talk about the status of those plants. And are they going to be profitable? Or what type of returns we're looking out there given the higher gas costs?"

So the first thing that I want to just highlight is the relative importance of the U.K. in terms of the overall portfolio. As Chris mentioned, if you look back to our results in 2020, it represented 2% of our total gross margin. So from an aggregate profitability standpoint, it's on the small end of the scale. Now it does provide a little bit of a natural hedge for us. When global energy costs are low and relatively flat, then we earn a better return there. When energy costs are high, we earn a much better return in the U.S. on a larger production base. So it's a little bit of a kind of a natural hedge in that regard.
But as you mentioned, because of a huge spike in gas cost in September, we took the plants off-line. We worked, I would say, very constructively with the U.K. government to restart the facility at Billingham and be able to provide CO2 into the U.K. marketplace. That's pretty critical for the normal functioning of a number of different industries over there. And during that period of time, the U.K. government also is very helpful in us, working with us, and the CO2 offtake companies, the industrial gas companies from Billingham to restructure those contracts in a way that makes that plant viable.
So we're really pleased with how that whole process developed. And the Billingham plant is up and operational, and we expect that to be viable in the long term. The Ince plant in the Northwest is not yet back online. We're evaluating a number of different options and scenarios. They are including being able to secure a vessel to bring ammonia into the facility so we can at a minimum run the upgrade plants. Given, again, the high cost of natural gas through the winter, it doesn't look like ammonia production there is going to make a lot of sense. But being able to bring in ammonia will allow us to run the upgrades and make an appropriate return on those products.
So we're kind of in a little bit of a wait-and-see mode in terms of what the longer range situation develops in the U.K. But I think for now, Billingham is up and operational. We expect that to happen. And again, we expect to be able to turn the back end of the fertilizer portion of the plant up and running. And Ince, hopefully, soon, within the next couple of weeks once we get the ammonia vessel squared away."

Can you talk about how the blue green ammonia market could impact the dynamics around the gray ammonia market in the future? I mean, we have projects like D'ville and Yazoo, turning some of the volumes from gray to blue. And as those tons are sold into clean ammonia applications like maybe with Mitsui, does that effectively mean a loss of supply for the gray ammonia market? And then on the demand side, like the molecules are the same, could there be a scenario where demand and supply maybe aren't matched up properly? So you have some applications that maybe need blue green ammonia. But if there isn't enough, you use a little bit of gray. Just in general, does the emergence of a blue green ammonia market mean potentially a tighter gray market in the future?"

I also think that's where -- not wanting to interpret things for them, but I think that that's consistent also with where Air Products and others see things headed. Hence, the announcement, both of the Neon project in Saudi Arabia, but also the recent announcement they had in Louisiana around a Blue project. And I think a number of the market participants see this coming. I think ultimately, what that's going to mean is you've got more demand than what current supply is in ammonia. It's going to bid in new production, new capacity, which the world is going to need. And that's pretty attractive relative to valuing existing assets. So we think, overall, this is a terrific set of factors that create a revaluation or rethinking about what the value of our asset base is, being that we're the largest ammonia producer in the world.
And I think the situation is not unlike what we've got today, right, which is -- today, as Bert mentioned, it's more of a supply side constraint given a bunch of curtailments and shutdowns and other disruptions. But in the future, even if those plants are off and running and you see demand continue to exceed where supply is capable of reaching, you see price escalation like we're experiencing right now."

I think our biggest focus area and the thing that we use as a lens to make all of those decisions is ultimately cash flow per share. And if we can find an opportunity that allows us to expand capacity, whether that's a debottleneck, inorganic acquisition or an organic kind of growth, where we believe that that's going to grow our free cash per share, then we'll take a serious run at it.
I think in these kind of context, we would be much more likely to think about partnership structures or other things like that if we were going to move forward on any of those things. But I do think it's a positive sign. When others out there are making announcements about adding capacity, I do believe we're the best operators of ammonia plants in the world. And so if there's opportunities for new capacity additions, we ought to be thinking about that along with other people. And I do think the world is going to need it. It's a question of when, and in the interim, are you better off buying existing assets or debottlenecking what you already have versus building new? But I think those are appropriate questions that anyone in the industry today is kind of mulling over and really thinking about."
