We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $264.8 million, shipped approximately 2.3 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2%,",2399,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2020 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $264.8 million, shipped approximately 2.3 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2%, and generated strong free cash flow of $78.5 million. 
We exited the fourth quarter at approximately 40, 13, 27. This means 40% gross margin, 13% operating expense and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Eric will go into greater details about our finances later in the call.
Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our customer experience personnel in all 4 worldwide locations, the U.S., Europe, India and Australia, are still working from home while supporting installers and homeowners. Our Q4 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 62% compared to 67% in Q3. And our North America Net Promoter Score was 68% compared to 71% in Q3. 
Our average call wait time increased in Q4 to more than 5 minutes as we onboarded new installers and fielded more calls relating to our storage systems. We are not happy about this increase in wait times and are working to bring them back to under a minute. The ramp of our Enphase Storage systems also increased call volumes as our installers are learning how to commission the system and homeowners are learning about the system's new features.
Let's now talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2020 played out. When the pandemic began, we cut manufacturing in Q2 of 2020 and then had to quickly ramp back up to meet the surge in demand in Q3 and Q4. The production in Q4 was more than 2x the level in Q2. I'm very pleased with the ramp of our Mexico factory that met our target of producing more than 1 million units in Q4. 
As part of our supply chain strategy to diversify production to tariff-free and cost-competitive locations globally, we began microinverter production at [Celcom] India in October of 2020 and started shipping to customers during Q4. We have a high-quality, state-of-the-art, automated line with a quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and the space to add a second line with the same capacity. The production drive is going very well, and we expect to produce approximately 400,000 microinverters in India in Q1. 
We have seen a strong increase in demand for our microinverter systems over the past several months as we continue to onboard new installers. At the same time, the uptick in broad economic activity has stressed the global semiconductor supply chain. We are seeing the constraints on a few semiconductor components used in our microinverters. Our existing suppliers are working very hard to increase the availability of components for us which, coupled along with the new suppliers we are qualifying, should help easing the constraints into the second quarter of 2021. To put the supply constraints into perspective, we see this as a more manageable situation than the high-voltage AC FET shortage we experienced in late 2018, early 2019. 
In terms of our battery pack supply, our second supplier began delivering cell packs in Q4 as planned and will be ramping capacity throughout the first half of 2021. We expect to have 120 megawatt hours available to us in the third quarter of 2021. We have adequate supply of cell packs with 2 suppliers, although we are continuing discussions with additional suppliers for geographic diversification.
Let's now move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%, respectively. We saw sequential revenue growth in all regions during the quarter and record sell-through from distributors to installers. 
The U.S. market was quite strong in Q4. U.S. revenue was up 55% sequentially. The sell-through of microinverters from our distributors to installers increased nearly 40% from Q3, which was also a record. As a result, the channel inventory for microinverters at the end of Q4 remains slightly lower than our target range of 8 to 10 weeks. We expect channel inventory to remain at these low levels through the end of Q1 due to strong demand and the semiconductor supply constraints. We continued ramping shipments of our storage systems nicely. We shipped 35% more megawatt hours in Q4 compared to Q3. 
In Europe, we reported record revenue for Q4. Revenue increased 10% sequentially. On an annual basis, the revenue from Europe increased 32% in 2020. Annualizing the Q4 revenue from Europe would have put us close to achieving our pre-pandemic target of doubling the revenue in the region. I am very pleased with our team's performance, and I'm excited about the region's projected growth in 2021 as the new markets we recently entered continue to gain traction. We will also be introducing our Enphase Storage system for the European market later in the third quarter of 2021, adding yet another growth driver. 
In Australia, we built on our strong Q3 results and achieved record quarterly sell-through and record installer count in Q4. The results were fueled by the launch of our Enphase Installer Network or EIN as well as growing demand for our high-power IQ7A microinverters plus a favorable competitive environment as regulations continue to shift towards safer and smarter solar. We expect to introduce our Enphase Storage system for the Australian market during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In Latin America, we reported record quarterly revenue. Puerto Rico showed strength for our microinverter systems as well as our storage systems. 
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss overall bookings for Q1. Our customer demand for Q1 significantly exceeds the high end of our guidance range for Q1. We are constrained by the semiconductor component availability as we discussed earlier. Our top priority is to take care of our installers, and our teams are working hard to minimize customer disruption. We have already factored in expedite costs into our Q1 guidance to ensure we put maximum number of units in customer hands.
Let's cover our storage rollout. We shipped 32 megawatt hours of storage systems in Q4, representing a growth of approximately 35% compared to Q3. Around 360 unique installers had commissioned at least one Enphase Storage system by the end of Q4. We are learning tremendously from the installers and homeowners and are thankful to them for enduring with the earlier mistakes and errors. We have made many updates to our software as well as our release process as a result of their feedback. 
Overall we are very pleased with the market interest in our storage system, although it did fall a little bit short of our internal shipment expectations for Q4. I attribute this to growing pains in ramping a new product as we actively worked with installers on selling, installing and commissioning this new product category that is much more complex and time-consuming than solar-only systems. With the strength of the microinverter system and microinverter system demand being so good, long tail installers naturally default into prioritizing solar-only systems that they know how to service best. Enphase has a responsibility to therefore ensure a best-in-class installer experience and ease of doing business for both solar plus storage installs. 
In addition to the long tail installers, we are working with a number of large installers. We recently announced storage agreements with Sunnova, Solar Optimum and Momentum Solar. These announcements provide confidence in a continued steady ramp in shipment volumes into 2021. We expect storage shipments to grow nicely in Q1 at a similar rate as Q4, despite the negative seasonality of the industries in each Q1. 
Coming back once again to long tail installers, they are our top priority. And we have made major modifications to our commissioning process to reduce installation and commissioning times for storage to sub-24 hours. This helps crew scheduling be more predictable and helps the installers profit on storage installs. With the installers facing labor constraints, the improved commissioning times should help them -- should help incentivize them to sell solar plus storage than just focusing on solar only.
Let's talk about more new products that we are coming out with. We recently announced that our storage systems are now compatible with existing M215 and M250-based solar systems. The expanded compatibility provides approximately 300,000 additional Enphase system owners in the U.S., with the possibility of achieving energy resilience through the Enphase upgrade program. 
We're also working on additional features to our Enphase Storage system to make it a lot more powerful. These include generator compatibility, load control, power control and 200% overload. We expect to release these features shortly. 
Let me cover them quickly one by one. Homeowners can add generators to their Enphase system. With our system, a generator ATS, an automatic transfer switch, is not necessary, thereby driving down cost and simplifying the install. Homeowners can configure the generators' behaviors from the Enphase app. The system can turn the generator on when the grid fails, either immediately or when the battery charge is below certain levels.
Next is load control. With this new feature, a homeowner will be able to control up to 4 critical loads by connecting them up to the Enphase system. The homeowner can then reconfigure the behavior of the system via the Enphase app. He can -- he or she can identify noncritical loads such as old pump to automatically turn off when the grid fails, or based on the state of charge of the battery. This ensures that the home does not black out during a grid outage, thereby providing a good customer experience. 
The next feature is card PCS. Power control system is a software capability in our system to regulate its output in a manner which does not increase the amount of current on the homeowner's main load center. This avoids an expensive upgrade of the main load center when a homeowner wants to add both solar and storage. 
The last feature, and an important one, is the 200% overload. Motor nodes such as ACs and well pumps have a significant power needs during startup, which if not met will black out a home. One way to solve the problem is to throw more dollars at it, which is to oversize a storage system, which is expensive. We solved this problem with an intelligent hardware- and software-based function card power start. In addition, we have increased the capability in our microinverters to supply up to 200% of the rated power of short duration in order to start motors, ensuring that the home does not black out. An Enphase storage system with this feature will help the homeowner optimize his system size and maximize value.
Next, we are making progress on our IQ 8 grid-independent solar microinverter. We already have IQ 8 alpha systems with and without Enphase storage running at various sites. We expect to complete beta installations and expect to begin shipping production in Q2. 
Our small commercial solution based on IQ 8 640-watt AC microinverter is making similar progress. Similar to residential solution, we expect to provide a complete solution that includes the microinverter system and a comprehensive digital platform to capture the entire journey of the installer and the system owner. The platform will provide a sophisticated design and proposal to permit package development service, commissioning, activation software tools were operations and maintenance, performance tracking and fleet management. We have begun also installations here and expect to start shipping production in Q2. 
Let me next talk about our portable power station, previously referred to as Ensemble in a Box. We are a little bit behind here, but have a good plan going forward. This will be our first consumer product. It will provide energy security indoors as well as energy on the go when you go outdoors. It is cloud connected and controlled via the Enphase app. We view this as a starter product for homeowners who are not yet ready to invest in a full solar or storage system. The product will support up to 1.3 kilowatt hours of storage, provide 1.6 kilowatts continuous and 3.2 kilowatts of peak power. It will keep the home's basic appliances such as lights, mobile devices, refrigerators on for a few hours during an outage. We expect to release this product during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Let's now cover digital transformation. I'm excited about our 2 recent acquisition announcements. 
The first one is Sofdesk. Headquartered in Montreal, Sofdesk provide design and proposal software for use by solar and roofing companies. 
The second announcement is the proposed acquisition of the Solar Design Services business of DIN Engineering. Based in Noida, India, the business provides rapid and cost-effective proposal drawings and permit plan sets to installers. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of Q1. 
These 2 acquisitions will add significant capabilities to our digital platform. By providing such tools and services to the installers, we aim to simplify the sales process while reducing soft costs and providing an enhanced buying experience for homeowners.
Turning to the other aspects of our digital platform. We have now onboarded 440 installers in North America to our Enphase Installer Network or EIN through a highly selective process focused on installation quality and homeowner experience. We launched our EIN in Australia during Q4 and look forward to launching EINs in Europe and India next. Our EIN installers can enjoy a variety of tools and services and the Enphase digital platform to make the sales and installation process faster and easier. 
In addition, we have [filed] our highly interactive Enphase system estimator to enable accurate sizing of storage systems with various home appliances. Installers can leverage this tool to provide an improved homeowner experience. 
We recently announced that Allison Johnson has joined Enphase as our CMO, Chief Marketing Officer. Her experience at some of the world's leading brands is key as we look to accelerate our growth and establish an path as a recognized consumer product leaders in the global transition to home electrification and full energy independence.
In summary, we are happy with our performance. We are excited about the strength in worldwide demand, the ramp of our storage systems, our upcoming new products, and our digital transformation efforts.  With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for a review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2020 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. 
We are very pleased with the significant increase in demand for our microinverter systems in Q4 2020 despite the pandemic. Total revenue for Q4 2020 was $264.8 million, which did not include any revenue from safe harbor shipments during the quarter. Total revenue increased 48% sequentially, and we shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC of microinverters and 32 megawatt hours of storage systems in Q4 2020. 32 megawatt hours is equivalent to 12.2 megawatt hours of power. 
As we previously discussed, some of our microinverter units met certain size and weight criteria, qualifying them for an exclusion to the Section 301 tariffs on prior shipments. We requested refunds totaling approximately $39 million plus accrued interest, of which $23 million were approved in Q3 2020 and $16 million were approved in Q4 2020. These refunds have been accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the respective quarters where they were approved, and the associated accrued interest was recorded in other expenses. We have excluded tariff refunds from non-GAAP financial results to present a more accurate picture of ongoing business performance. We don't expect any further refunds in 2021. 
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 2020, which excluded the $16 million tariff approved refund, was 40.2 cents compared to 41 cent -- 41% for Q3 2020. The sequential decline was due to higher shipping and logistics costs compared -- logistics costs related to component supply constraints. GAAP gross margin was 46% for Q4 2020. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $34.2 million for Q4 2020 compared to $29.6 million for Q3 2020. The sequential increase was primarily due to the hiring of 85 employees during the quarter mainly focused on engineering, customer experience and innovation. GAAP operating expenses were $42.8 million for Q4 2020 compared to $43.2 million for Q3 2020. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 2020 included $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $684,000 of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. 
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $72.4 million for Q4 2020 compared to $43.7 million for Q3 2020. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $79.1 million for Q4 2020 compared to $51.8 million for Q3 2020. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 2020 was $71.3 million compared to $41.8 million for Q3 2020. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for Q4 2020 compared to $0.30 per share for Q3 2020. On an annual basis, we are pleased to report a record non-GAAP net income of $188.5 million. 
GAAP net income for Q4 2020 was $73 million compared to GAAP net income of $39.4 million for Q3 2020. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50 for Q4 2020 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in Q3 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was 48-point -- $41.8 million at the end of Q4 2020 compared to $37.5 million at the end of Q3 2020. The sequential increase in inventory was driven by the planned increase of raw materials for our Enphase Storage systems in anticipation of the production ramp in 2021. 
Although the dollar value of inventory increased sequentially, days of inventory, or turn, decreased to 27 days compared to 41 days in Q3. This sequential decrease in days of inventory was driven by the higher shipment volumes in Q4. Our target is 30 days nominally, and we will always do what is right for customers. 
Accounts receivables were $182.2 million at the end of Q4 2020 compared to $122.4 million at the end of Q3 2020. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q4. DSO of 50 days decreased slightly from 52 days in prior quarter due to our collection management. We remain committed to efficient working capital management and driving down our cash conversion cycle. 
We exited Q4 2020 with a total cash balance of $679.4 million compared to $661.8 million for Q3 2020. We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. However, we spent $16.3 million on withhold to cover tax transactions on employee stock vesting that prevented the issuance of approximately 132,000 shares in Q4. For the calendar year 2020, we spent $58.3 million at an average price of $50 per share on withhold to cover transactions and prevented the issuance of approximately 1.4 million shares. 
In Q4, we also spent $43.9 million on the partial repurchase of convertible notes due 2024. Since the end of Q4, we have received additional conversion requests of $61.5 million as the notes are deep in the money compared to the conversion price. We expect to repay the principal amount of these conversion requests in cash and in-the-money amount in shares. Settlement will occur in Q1 2021. 
In Q4 2020, we generated $84.2 million in cash flow from operations and $78.5 million in free cash flow. For calendar year 2020, we generated a record $198.9 million of free cash flow. 
Capital expenditure was $8.9 million for Q4 mainly for the Enphase Storage manufacturing capacity increase, IT enhancements, and lighting software app development costs and the production ramp with our second contract manufacturing partner. Capital expenditure for 2020 was $20.6 million. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $280 million to $300 million. 
We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40%, and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 1 -- to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. The gross margin guidance includes a further increase in shipping and logistic costs to ensure we are best serving our customers and getting them as many units as possible. 
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64 million to $67 million, including a total of approximately $22 million estimated for stock op based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42 million to $45 million. 
All guidance estimates include the Sofdesk acquisition but do not include the DIN Solar Design Services business. 
I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing quite a bit from Q4 to Q1. The increase is due to 2 reasons: hiring to support our growth plans and consolidation of acquisitions plus related incentive accruals. The hiring is related to the new product development and investment in innovation to create best-in-class home energy management system. The Sofdesk and DIN Solar Design Services business acquisition are building blocks that enable us to build a world-class digital platform for homeowners and installers. At the same time, we are not taking our eyes off the baseline financial model and plan to maintain operating expenses at 15% of revenue. 
Before turning the call back to the operator for questions, I would like to mention a couple of things. First, we published our inaugural ESG report a few weeks ago. Sustainability is at the core of what we do at Enphase, and we are proud of our team as we continue to enable clean energy and energy independence through innovation.
Second, Enphase has recently added -- has been recently added to the S&P 500 index, and we are very proud of this accomplishment. I want to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the entire Enphase team.
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

Maybe first if we could sort of dig into the guidance a little bit, I know there's some shortages here on the micro side. I'm assuming there's some on the battery side as well. But can you give us a sense of sort of supply demand for both the micro side as well as the Encharge system? It sounds like you're leaving some business on the table here. Can you kind of quantify what impact that's having on Q1? And is that expected to also persist into Q2? 
And then related to that, I guess on gross margins, what percent hit did you see? Is it 100 bps? Is it more than that on Q4, given the additional freight and logistics costs you had to incur?"

So demand is quite high. Customer demand is quite high there. And I once again go back and attribute it to our high quality and high customer experience. So basically, while I'm not going to quantify how muc",833,"Yes. So let me start with the microinverters. So demand is quite high. Customer demand is quite high there. And I once again go back and attribute it to our high quality and high customer experience. 
So basically, while I'm not going to quantify how much the demand is higher compared to the high end of the guidance, I already said it is significantly high. And our constraints basically are coming from the semiconductor components, and that's an industry-wide issue right now. 
There are 2 specific components that we are constrained on. One is our ASIC that goes into the micro, and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high-voltage FET. There -- the name of the game is we are qualifying multiple more sources so that we have more supply as well as expediting product. And I'm in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies, and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by early April. 
Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they are not affected. So that's on the microinverter side. 
On the storage side, we have enough capacity. We already said that we will -- we have about as of last quarter, we had about 50 megawatt hours of capacity. And then as of Q3 of '21, we will have 120 megawatt hours of capacity. We have enough capacity on the storage side. 
And on the storage side, once again reflecting back on how we did, we started shipping storage in the third quarter. I'm pretty happy with the ramp. Compared to the third quarter, I did about -- we did about 35% more megawatt hours in Q4 compared to Q3. And for Q1, we do expect to do a similar amount higher than Q4. 
So let me come to some more statistics on storage so that you get a flavor for it. Essentially, like what I said, about 360-plus installation, installed -- unique installation companies have installed at least one Enphase Storage system. We have trained over 650 unique installation companies. We have trained overall more than 1,200 installation personnel. 
The -- what we are seeing, we have learned a lot in the process mainly from installers as well as a lot of homeowners, and we are improving them one by one. So although I said in the prepared remarks I wish we had shipped a little bit more, but I think we are doing the right things by fixing these problems. 
For example, our commissioning time needs work. And we are in the process of improving the commissioning time to sub 24 hours. And it is all about -- for us, it is all about taking care of the installer, making sure that the installer experience is seamless. Ease of doing business is what we are all about. Therefore, we will never compromise on the short term in order to achieve that. 
So more examples is very often, the installers usually struggle on storage with main panel rewiring and replacement. So that's a big pain point for the installers, and we are working on steps to solve that. 
Ease of -- when it comes to our ease of doing business, the homeowners are still [their intent] on learning how to use storage systems. So while the transition from -- [on grid] is seamless, the fact it is seamless means that the homeowners do not change their behavior. And Enphase needs to do a lot more there to educate the homeowner in a seamless way. This is intelligent notification, intelligent text messaging, intelligent reload control, which we are actually running. 
And to -- one more thing is to also go back and do the storage design right in the first place. Very often people miss that storage is all about taking care of power properly, and most of the people miss that. Once again, it is -- Enphase needs to take responsibility to do whatever it takes to simplify the installers' ease of doing business. 
And of course now I'm coming to the industry changes that are needed, which are permitting needs to be a little bit faster on storage. That's an industry-wide problem, which I'm sure many of our peers [and that] are going to be working on. 
The last one is financing for storage. We need some kind of innovative financing schemes in storage, so that also starts accelerating overall. 
I hope I gave you some flavor, but if I were to summarize, we are growing at a very nice clip, 35% from -- in Q4 compared to Q3. We'll do a similar rate in Q1 compared to Q4, and our focus is on the long term. We will take care of our installers, training and making our storage system easy to install. That's our focus."

Maybe just -- I had a second question on batteries, and you touched upon some of this. But if I kind of back into the numbers, it seems like you did maybe $25 million, $30 million of -- in charge revenue in Q4, and that will be well into the $30 million-plus range in Q1 based on the guidance. So first question on batteries, is it fair to assume those are the right revenue ranges, and there's no change to pricing in the near term? 
And then second question is just on -- I know given it's a new product and the installation rates are not as sort of swift as what you're used to on the solar side, your shipments are not keeping up with capacity. You've talked about 120 megawatt hours by Q2, kind of 35% surge capacity you want to have in place. So maybe 85, 90 megawatt hours really being the shippable capacity you're targeting. When do you think we get closer to shipments lining up with kind of your applicable capacity?"

So the combination of a stand-alone storage device plus a safety device, the micro interconnect, can now add substantial value to the homeowner, both in terms of providing resiliency in this event of an outage as well as participating in value-added services such as grid services, for example.

And IQ 9, our vision is basically obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ 8. 
Right now, we are focused on a few areas. One is we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the caps, the 600-volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread. GaN on GaN, GAN on silicon, they are becoming widespread. The advantage that GaN gives is I can now run my AC FETs at a higher frequency. Because they can run it at higher frequency, I can reduce my transformer sizes. And because they can reduce my transformer sizes, the entire footprint can get a lot smaller. 
Of course, this is me speaking theoretically, and we need to demonstrate that with both prototype vehicles as well as qualifying, reliability, et cetera. I expect that to take the next 12 to 18 months. 
And we will also be working on the next generation as well to think about maybe sophisticated cooling themes, alternatives to porting, et cetera, alternatives to meaning -- so today, we have -- between our gig drivers and our AC FETs and the DC FETs, we have a lot of components there using semiconductor packaging. 
And again, I may be able to collapse all of those to substantially less number of components. We'll be looking at those as well. 
So a lot of R&D is going on. We hired our CTO a year ago. His name is Hans. He's an outstanding guy. And we have started all of those discussions, and there is a team actually behind it. Whenever Eric Branderiz, our CFO, says innovation, he means that investment in the CTO team. We are investing a lot more than before."

We are, for instance, so we have the microgrid interconnect device or smart switch.

So just by simply the act of connecting the generator into their device, the entire system is now managed by their device and managed by the energy management system. 
There are a few other advantages as a result of the way we integrate everything into the a domain is that the generator can now run in parallel to the storage system. So what that means is the homeowner can configure up their system and the system will automatically make decisions such as turn on, for example, turn on when the grid sales instantly turn the generator on instantly as well as a great sales. Or for example, once a grid fails, you only turn the generator on when the state of charge is at a certain level, and then it turns back off when the state of charge has reached another level. 
Another functionality there is, for example, a quiet period, right? You can configure up all the in software. You can configure it all up saying, during this time of the night, don't start generators, so you can reduce noise pollution. So it's a very rich experience. You can get to see exactly how the power flow is in real time on your app, so a much, much more well integrated, one-stop shop solution with an integrating generator into a common platform."

40485464,702199978,2201067,"Enphase Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Enphase Energy, Inc.","Executives","No, like what I told earlier, maybe even I answered Brian Lee and I went through the details. So let me cover them once again. Basically, there are several things that can go wrong for the installers on storage. There are some things that we are squarel",573,"No, like what I told earlier, maybe even I answered Brian Lee and I went through the details. So let me cover them once again. 
Basically, there are several things that can go wrong for the installers on storage. There are some things that we are squarely responsible for Enphase. 
Like the installers want to come on to a job site, and they want to finish their install, and they want to leave within 12 hours. And if our commissioning time is excessive, we are going to place burden on installers. And we understand that we are working with them to rapidly reduce that commissioning time. That's an example. 
The second one is very often installers have to come in and rewire the main panel, and that is often several thousands of dollars. If we can help them create a solution which does not need that, that's ease of doing business for installers. That's number two. 
Number three, as homeowners start to experience these storage systems, they are going to be calling installers often. For example, when you switch from on grid to off grid, if you haven't made any adjustments in your lifestyle and your grid is out, your external grid is out, utility grid is out, then you're going to quickly run out of storage in 3 or 4 hours because the air conditioner is going to be on. So therefore, people who do not even know that they are after, run out of storage, run out of power and they call installers. And the installers have to go and help them. It's another truck roll for them. That means lost profit for them. 
So how can Enphase help them in order to eliminate all of those problems for installers? Make it so easy that an Enphase system seamlessly provides intelligent notification for homeowners? How can an Enphase system seamlessly provide load control such that the homeowner can automatically set in the app saying, ""When I switch to off grid, do not turn on my AC."" So you maximize your storage system's life, right? 
And then going back to it all is even when the storage system is being designed in the first place as a consultative sale between the homeowner and the installer, what can Enphase do to make sure that complete transparency to the homeowner, so that it's simple yet complete? And I think those are things that are entirely in Enphase's control, and it will be remiss if we don't take responsibility there. That's one. 
Then I talked about the industry, overall industry. Overall industry, there are problems with permitting cycle times are too long. It's not acceptable. And we all need to do -- our peers all need to fight that battle. 
And the last one is the -- just as financing for solar is getting a lot more mature, financing for storage needs to attain that maturity. And then what happens is you start, more people will start to -- they are comfortable with monthly payments, then cash upfront, a lot of cash upfront. 
So those 2 are industry problems that will be working. So it's a combo of Enphase-specific stuff, which we are going to put a lot of energy on, and industry changes that we are going to try to influence. Those are the things we need to do in order to ensure we start ramping much more than our already nice ramp  now."

These are the -- many of the comments made by Badri are not unique to Enphase. We are approaching this like we are training installers that they never done an installation before, storage, and they are doing really well with microinverter, so for them to say, I need to [indiscernible] a new product, convince the homeowner that is a great product. And when they do that, after that, get everything lined up with the crews with the commissioning and do the installation, complete the training and everything, it takes time, right? And right now, they are basically hand to mouth with the microinverter systems, right? 
So we decided to launch with the long tail. That's an investment that we are making. Once they made the investment using our system, we believe they will have a hard time switching to a potential alternative because they are all trained. They know our technology, they know our pitch. 
And then with that concurrently, we have interest from tier 2s and tier 1 s that they are sophisticated. They've done installs before. They kind of completed that process with competitive products. And they feel that our product will be an easy train, right? So all of those things are being attacked at the same time."

We had a good quarter. We reported a revenue of $264.8 million, shipped approximately 2.3 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2%, and generated strong free cash flow of $78.5 million. 
We exited the fourth quarter at approximately 40, 13, 27. This means 40% gross margin, 13% operating expense and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Eric will go into greater details about our finances later in the call.
Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our customer experience personnel in all 4 worldwide locations, the U.S., Europe, India and Australia, are still working from home while supporting installers and homeowners. Our Q4 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 62% compared to 67% in Q3. And our North America Net Promoter Score was 68% compared to 71% in Q3. 
Our average call wait time increased in Q4 to more than 5 minutes as we onboarded new installers and fielded more calls relating to our storage systems. We are not happy about this increase in wait times and are working to bring them back to under a minute. The ramp of our Enphase Storage Systems also increased call volumes as our installers are learning how to commission the system and homeowners are learning about the system's new features.
Let's now talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2020 played out. When the pandemic began, we cut manufacturing in Q2 of 2020 and then had to quickly ramp back up to meet the surge in demand in Q3 and Q4. The production in Q4 was more than 2x the level in Q2. I'm very pleased with the ramp of our Mexico factory that met our target of producing more than 1 million units in Q4. 
As part of our supply chain strategy to diversify production to tariff-free and cost-competitive locations globally, we began microinverter production at Salcomp India in October of 2020 and started shipping to customers during Q4. We have a high-quality, state-of-the-art, automated line with a quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and the space to add a second line with the same capacity. The production drive is going very well, and we expect to produce approximately 400,000 microinverters in India in Q1. 
We have seen a strong increase in demand for our microinverter systems over the past several months as we continue to onboard new installers. At the same time, the uptick in broad economic activity has stressed the global semiconductor supply chain. We are seeing constraints on a few semiconductor components used in our microinverters. Our existing suppliers are working very hard to increase the availability of components for us which, coupled along with the new suppliers we are qualifying, should help easing the constraints into the second quarter of 2021. To put the supply constraints into perspective, we see this as a more manageable situation than the high-voltage AC FET shortage we experienced in late 2018, early 2019. 
In terms of our battery pack supply, our second supplier began delivering cell packs in Q4 as planned and will be ramping capacity throughout the first half of 2021. We expect to have 120 megawatt hours available to us in the third quarter of 2021. We have adequate supply of cell packs with 2 suppliers, although we are continuing discussions with additional suppliers for geographic diversification.
Let's now move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%, respectively. We saw sequential revenue growth in all regions during the quarter and record sell-through from distributors to installers. 
The U.S. market was quite strong in Q4. U.S. revenue was up 55% sequentially. The sell-through of microinverters from our distributors to installers increased nearly 40% from Q3, which was also a record. As a result, the channel inventory for microinverters at the end of Q4 remains slightly lower than our target range of 8 to 10 weeks. We expect channel inventory to remain at these low levels through the end of Q1 due to strong demand and the semiconductor supply constraints. We continued ramping shipments of our storage systems nicely. We shipped 35% more megawatt hours in Q4 compared to Q3. 
In Europe, we reported record revenue for Q4. Revenue increased 10% sequentially. On an annual basis, the revenue from Europe increased 32% in 2020. Annualizing the Q4 revenue from Europe would have put us close to achieving our pre-pandemic target of doubling the revenue in the region. I am very pleased with our team's performance, and I'm excited about the region's projected growth in 2021 as the new markets we recently entered continue to gain traction. We will also be introducing our Enphase Storage System for the European market later in the third quarter of 2021, adding yet another growth driver. 
In Australia, we built on our strong Q3 results and achieved record quarterly sell-through and record installer count in Q4. The results were fueled by the launch of our Enphase Installer Network or EIN as well as growing demand for our high-power IQ7A microinverters plus a favorable competitive environment as regulations continue to shift towards safer and smarter solar. We expect to introduce our Enphase Storage system for the Australian market during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In Latin America, we reported record quarterly revenue. Puerto Rico showed strength for our microinverter systems as well as our storage systems. 
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss overall bookings for Q1. Our customer demand for Q1 significantly exceeds the high end of our guidance range for Q1. We are constrained by the semiconductor component availability as we discussed earlier. Our top priority is to take care of our installers, and our teams are working hard to minimize customer disruption. We have already factored in expedited costs into our Q1 guidance to ensure we put maximum number of units in customer hands.
Let's cover our storage rollout. We shipped 32 megawatt hours of storage systems in Q4, representing a growth of approximately 35% compared to Q3. Around 360 unique installers had commissioned at least one Enphase Storage system by the end of Q4. We are learning tremendously from the installers and homeowners and are thankful to them for enduring with the earlier mistakes and errors. We have made many updates to our software as well as our release process as a result of their feedback. 
Overall we are very pleased with the market interest in our storage system, although it did fall a little bit short of our internal shipment expectations for Q4. I attribute this to growing pains in ramping a new product as we actively worked with installers on selling, installing and commissioning this new product category that is much more complex and time-consuming than solar-only systems. With the strength of the microinverter system and microinverter system demand being so good, long tail installers naturally default into prioritizing solar-only systems that they know how to service best. Enphase has a responsibility to therefore ensure a best-in-class installer experience and ease of doing business for both solar plus storage installs. 
In addition to the long tail installers, we are working with a number of large installers. We recently announced storage agreements with Sunnova, Solar Optimum and Momentum Solar. These announcements provide confidence in a continued steady ramp in shipment volumes into 2021. We expect storage shipments to grow nicely in Q1 at a similar rate as Q4, despite the negative seasonality of the industries in each Q1. 
Coming back once again to long tail installers, they are our top priority. And we have made major modifications to our commissioning process to reduce installation and commissioning times for storage to sub-24 hours. This helps crew scheduling be more predictable and helps installers profit on storage installs. With installers facing labor constraints, the improved commissioning times should help them -- should help incentivize them to sell solar plus storage than just focusing on solar only.
Let's talk about more new products that we are coming out with. We recently announced that our storage systems are now compatible with existing M215 and M250-based solar systems. The expanded compatibility provides approximately 300,000 additional Enphase system owners in the U.S., with the possibility of achieving energy resilience through the Enphase upgrade program. 
We're also working on additional features to our Enphase Storage system to make it a lot more powerful. These include generator compatibility, load control, power control and 200% overload. We expect to release these features shortly. 
Let me cover them quickly one by one. Homeowners can add generators to their Enphase system. With our system, a generator ATS, an automatic transfer switch, is not necessary, thereby driving down cost and simplifying the install. Homeowners can configure the generators' behaviors via the Enphase app. The system can turn the generator on when the grid fails, either immediately or when the battery charge is below a certain level.
Next is load control. With this new feature, a homeowner will be able to control up to 4 critical loads by connecting them up to the Enphase system. The homeowner can then reconfigure the behavior of the system via the Enphase app. He can -- he or she can identify noncritical loads such as whole pump to automatically turn off when the grid fails, or based on the state of charge of the battery. This ensures that the home does not black out during a grid outage, thereby providing a good customer experience. 
The next feature is called PCS. Power control system is a software capability in our system to regulate its output in a manner which does not increase the amount of current on the homeowner's main load center. This avoids an expensive upgrade of the main load center when a homeowner wants to add both solar and storage. 
The last feature, and an important one, is the 200% overload. Motor nodes such as ACs and well pumps have a significant power need during startup, which if not met, will black out a home. One way to solve the problem is to throw more dollars at it, which is to oversize a storage system, which is expensive. We solved this problem with an intelligent hardware- and software-based function called power start. In addition, we have increased the capability in our microinverters to supply up to 200% of the rated power for short duration in order to start motors, ensuring that the home does not black out. An Enphase storage system with this feature will help the homeowner optimize his system size and maximize value.
Next, we are making progress on our IQ8 grid-independent solar microinverter. We already have IQ 8 alpha systems with and without Enphase storage running at various sites. We expect to complete beta installations and expect to begin shipping production in Q2. 
Our small commercial solution based on IQ8D 640-watt AC microinverter is making similar progress. Similar to residential solution, we expect to provide a complete solution that includes the microinverter system and a comprehensive digital platform to capture the entire journey of the installer and the system owner. The platform will provide a sophisticated design and proposal to permit package development service, commissioning, activation software, tools for operations and maintenance, performance tracking and fleet management. We have begun also installations here and expect to start shipping production in Q2. 
Let me next talk about our portable power station, previously referred to as Ensemble in a Box. We are a little bit behind here, but have a good plan going forward. This will be our first consumer product. It will provide energy security indoors as well as energy on the go when you go outdoors. It is cloud connected and controlled via the Enphase app. We view this as a starter product for homeowners who are not yet ready to invest in a full solar or storage system. The product will support up to 1.3 kilowatt hours of storage, provide 1.6 kilowatts continuous and 3.2 kilowatts of peak power. It will keep the home's basic appliances such as lights, mobile devices, refrigerators on for a few hours during an outage. We expect to release this product during the fourth quarter of 2021.
Let's now cover digital transformation. I'm excited about our 2 recent acquisition announcements. 
The first one is Sofdesk. Headquartered in Montreal, Sofdesk provide design and proposal software for use by solar and roofing companies. 
The second announcement is the proposed acquisition of the Solar Design Services business of DIN Engineering. Based in Noida, India, the business provides rapid and cost-effective proposal drawings and permit plan sets to installers. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of Q1. 
These 2 acquisitions will add significant capabilities to our digital platform. By providing such tools and services to the installers, we aim to simplify the sales process while reducing soft costs and providing an enhanced buying experience for homeowners.
Turning to the other aspects of our digital platform. We have now onboarded 440 installers in North America to our Enphase Installer Network or EIN through a highly selective process focused on installation quality and homeowner experience. We launched our EIN in Australia during Q4 and look forward to launching EINs in Europe and India next. Our EIN installers can enjoy a variety of tools and services and the Enphase digital platform to make the sales and installation process faster and easier. 
In addition, we have modified our highly interactive Enphase system estimator tool to enable accurate sizing of storage systems of various home appliances. Installers can leverage this tool to provide an improved homeowner experience. 
We recently announced that Allison Johnson has joined Enphase as our CMO, Chief Marketing Officer. Her experience at some of the world's leading brands is key as we look to accelerate our growth and establish Enphase a recognized consumer product leaders in the global transition to home electrification and full energy independence.
In summary, we are happy with our performance. We are excited about the strength in worldwide demand, the ramp of our storage systems, our upcoming new products, and our digital transformation efforts.  With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for a review of our finances. Eric?"

We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP fin",1314,"Thanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2020 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. 
We are very pleased with the significant increase in demand for our microinverter systems in Q4 2020 despite the pandemic. Total revenue for Q4 2020 was $264.8 million, which did not include any revenue from safe harbor shipments during the quarter. Total revenue increased 48% sequentially, and we shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC of microinverters and 32 megawatt hours of storage systems in Q4 2020. The 32 megawatt hours is equivalent to 12.2 megawatt hours of power. 
As we previously discussed, some of our microinverter units met certain size and weight criteria, qualifying them for an exclusion to the Section 301 tariffs on prior shipments. We requested refunds totaling approximately $39 million plus accrued interest, of which $23 million were approved in Q3 2020 and $16 million were approved in Q4 2020. These refunds have been accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the respective quarters where they were approved, and the associated accrued interest was recorded in other expenses. We have excluded tariff refunds from non-GAAP financial results to present a more accurate picture of ongoing business performance. We don't expect any further refunds in 2021. 
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 2020, which excluded the $16 million tariff approved refund, was 40.2 cents compared to 41 cent -- 41% for Q3 2020. The sequential decline was due to higher shipping and logistics costs compared -- logistics costs related to component supply constraints. GAAP gross margin was 46% for Q4 2020. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $34.2 million for Q4 2020 compared to $29.6 million for Q3 2020. The sequential increase was primarily due to the hiring of 85 employees during the quarter mainly focused on engineering, customer experience and innovation. GAAP operating expenses were $42.8 million for Q4 2020 compared to $43.2 million for Q3 2020. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 2020 included $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $684,000 of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. 
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $72.4 million for Q4 2020 compared to $43.7 million for Q3 2020. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $79.1 million for Q4 2020 compared to $51.8 million for Q3 2020. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 2020 was $71.3 million compared to $41.8 million for Q3 2020. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for Q4 2020 compared to $0.30 per share for Q3 2020. On an annual basis, we are pleased to report a record non-GAAP net income of $188.5 million. 
GAAP net income for Q4 2020 was $73 million compared to GAAP net income of $39.4 million for Q3 2020. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50 for Q4 2020 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in Q3 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was 48-point -- $41.8 million at the end of Q4 2020 compared to $37.5 million at the end of Q3 2020. The sequential increase in inventory was driven by the planned increase of raw materials for our Enphase Storage Systems in anticipation of the production ramp in 2021. 
Although the dollar value of inventory increased sequentially, days of inventory, of turn, decreased to 27 days compared to 41 days in Q3. This sequential decrease in days of inventory was driven by the higher shipment volumes in Q4. Our target is 30 days nominally, and we will always do what is right for customers. 
Accounts receivables were $182.2 million at the end of Q4 2020 compared to $122.4 million at the end of Q3 2020. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q4. DSO of 50 days decreased slightly from 52 days in prior quarter due to our collection management. We remain committed to efficient working capital management and driving down our cash conversion cycle. 
We exited Q4 2020 with a total cash balance of $679.4 million compared to $661.8 million for Q3 2020. We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. However, we spent $16.3 million on withhold to cover tax transactions on employee stock vesting that prevented the issuance of approximately 132,000 shares in Q4. For the calendar year 2020, we spent $58.3 million at an average price of $50 per share on withhold to cover transactions and prevented the issuance of approximately 1.4 million shares. 
In Q4, we also spent $43.9 million on the partial repurchase of convertible notes due 2024. Since the end of Q4, we have received additional conversion requests of $61.5 million as the notes are deep in the money compared to the conversion price. We expect to repay the principal amount of these conversion requests in cash and in-the-money amount in shares. Settlement will occur in Q1 2021. 
In Q4 2020, we generated $84.2 million in cash flow from operations and $78.5 million in free cash flow. For calendar year 2020, we generated a record $198.9 million of free cash flow. 
Capital expenditure was $8.9 million for Q4 mainly for the Enphase Storage manufacturing capacity increase, IT enhancements, and lighting software app development costs and the production ramp with our second contract manufacturing partner. Capital expenditure for 2020 was $20.6 million. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $280 million to $300 million. 
We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40%, and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 1 -- to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. The gross margin guidance includes a further increase in shipping and logistic costs to ensure we are best serving our customers and getting them as many units as possible. 
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64 million to $67 million, including a total of approximately $22 million estimated for stock op -- based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42 million to $45 million. 
All guidance estimates include the Sofdesk acquisition but do not include the DIN Solar Design Services business. 
I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing quite a bit from Q4 to Q1. The increase is due to 2 reasons: Hire  to support our growth plans and consolidation of acquisitions plus related incentive accruals. The hiring is related to the new product development and investment in innovation to create best-in-class home energy management system. The Sofdesk and DIN Solar Design Services business acquisition are building blocks that enable us to build a world-class digital platform for homeowners and installers. At the same time, we are not taking our eyes off the baseline financial model and plan to maintain operating expenses at 15% of revenue. 
Before turning the call back to the operator for questions, I would like to mention a couple of things. First, we published our inaugural ESG report a few weeks ago. Sustainability is at the core of what we do at Enphase, and we are proud of our team as we continue to enable clean energy and energy independence through innovation.
Second, Enphase has recently added -- has been recently added to the S&P 500 index, and we are very proud of this accomplishment. I want to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the entire Enphase team.
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

Maybe first, if we could sort of dig into the guidance a little bit, I know there's some shortages here on the micro side. I'm assuming there's some on the battery side as well. But can you give us a sense of sort of supply demand for both the micro side as well as the Encharge system? It sounds like you're leaving some business on the table here. Can you kind of quantify what impact that's having on Q1? And is that expected to also persist into Q2? 
And then related to that, I guess on gross margins, what percent hit did you see? Is it 100 bps? Is it more than that on Q4, given the additional freight and logistics costs you had to incur?"

So demand is quite high. Customer demand is quite high there. And I once again go back and attribute it to our high quality and high customer experience. So basically, while I'm not going to quantify how muc",838,"Yes. So let me start with the microinverters. So demand is quite high. Customer demand is quite high there. And I once again go back and attribute it to our high quality and high customer experience. 
So basically, while I'm not going to quantify how much the demand is higher compared to the high end of the guidance, I already said it is significantly high. And our constraints basically are coming from the semiconductor components, and that's an industry-wide issue right now. 
There are 2 specific components that we are constrained on. One is our ASIC that goes into the micro, and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high-voltage FET. There -- the name of the game is we are qualifying multiple more sources so that we have more supply as well as expediting product. And I'm in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies, and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by early April. 
Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they are not affected. So that's on the microinverter side. 
On the storage side, we have enough capacity. We already said that we will -- we have about as of last quarter, we had about 50 megawatt hours of capacity. And then as of Q3 of '21, we will have 120 megawatt hours of capacity. We have enough capacity on the storage side. 
And on the storage side, once again reflecting back on how we did, we started shipping storage in the third quarter. I'm pretty happy with the ramp. Compared to the third quarter, I did about -- we did about 35% more megawatt hours in Q4 compared to Q3. And for Q1, we do expect to do a similar amount higher than Q4. 
So let me come to some more statistics on storage so that you get a flavor for it. Essentially, like what I said, about 360-plus installation, installed -- unique installation companies have installed at least one Enphase Storage system. We have trained over 650 unique installation companies. We have trained overall more than 1,200 installation personnel. 
The -- what we are seeing, we have learned a lot in the process mainly from installers as well as a lot of homeowners, and we are improving them one by one. So although I said in the prepared remarks, I wish we had shipped a little bit more, but I think we are doing the right things by fixing these problems. 
For example, our commissioning time needs work. And we are in the process of improving the commissioning time to sub 24 hours. And it is all about -- for us, it is all about taking care of the installer, making sure that the installer experience is seamless. Ease of doing business is what we are all about. Therefore, we will never compromise on the short term in order to achieve that. 
So more examples is very often, the installers usually struggle on storage with main panel rewiring and replacement. So that's a big pain point for the installers, and we are working on steps to solve that. 
Ease of -- when it comes to our ease of doing business, the homeowners are still very intent on learning how to use storage systems. So while the transition from -- on-grid to off-grid is seamless, the fact it is seamless means that the homeowners do not change their behavior. And Enphase needs to do a lot more there to educate the homeowner in a seamless way. This is intelligent notification, intelligent text messaging, intelligent reloader control, which we are actually working on.. 
And to -- one more thing is to also go back and do the storage design right in the first place. Very often people miss that storage is all about taking care of power properly, and most of the people miss that. Once again, it is -- Enphase needs to take responsibility to do whatever it takes to simplify the installers' ease of doing business. 
And of course now I'm coming to the industry changes that are needed, which are permitting needs to be a little bit faster on storage. That's an industry-wide problem, which I'm sure many of our peers -- and that's what we're going to be working on. 
The last one is financing for storage. We need some kind of innovative financing schemes in storage, so that also starts accelerating overall. 
And I hope I gave you some flavor, but if I were to summarize, we are growing at a very nice clip, 35% from -- in Q4 compared to Q3. We'll do a similar rate in Q1 compared to Q4, and our focus is on the long term. We will take care of our installers, training and making our storage system easiest to install. That's our focus."

But if I kind of back into the numbers, it seems like you did maybe $25 million, $30 million of -- in charge revenue in Q4, and that will be well into the $30 million-plus range in Q1 based on the guidance. So first question on batteries, is it fair to assume those are the right revenue ranges, and there's no change to pricing in the near term? 
And then second question is just on -- I know given it's a new product and the installation rates are not as sort of swift as what you're used to on the solar side, your shipments are not keeping up necessarily with capacity. You've talked about 120 megawatt hours by Q2, kind of 35% surge capacity you want to have in place. So maybe 85, 90 megawatt hours really being the shippable capacity you're targeting. When do you think we get closer to shipments lining up with kind of your applicable capacity?"

And the nice thing about our architecture, the fact that we are AC coupled means that it lends itself very well to a stand-alone system. So the combination of a stand-alone storage device plus a safety device, the microgrid interconnect, can now add substantial value to the homeowner, both in terms of providing resiliency in this event of an outage plus as well as participating in value-added services such as grid services, for example. One could even extend their thinking into our portable power station, but also someday we participate in that as well in terms of providing both resiliency as well as participating in value-added services.

And IQ9, our vision is basically, obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ8. 
Right now, we are focused on a few areas. One is we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the ECAPs, the 600-volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread. GaN on GaN, GaN on silicon, they are becoming widespread. The advantage that GaN gives is I can now run my AC FETs at a higher frequency. Because they can run it at higher frequency, I can reduce my transformer sizes. And because they can reduce my transformer sizes, the entire footprint can get a lot smaller. 
Of course, this is me speaking theoretically, and we need to demonstrate that with both prototype vehicles as well as qualifying, reliability, et cetera. I expect that to take the next 12 to 18 months. 
And we will also be working on the next generation as well to think about maybe sophisticated cooling themes, alternatives to porting, et cetera, alternatives to -- meaning -- so today, we have -- between our gig drivers and our AC FETs and the DC FETs, we have a lot of components there using semiconductor packaging. 
And again, I may be able to collapse all of those to substantially less number of components. We'll be looking at those as well. 
So a lot of R&D is going on. We hired our CTO a year ago. His name is Hans. He's an outstanding guy. And we have started all of those discussions, and there is a team actually behind it. Whenever Eric Branderiz, our CFO, says innovation, he means that investment in the CTO team. We are investing a lot more than before."

We have recently opened up offices in Poland. Spain, we have sales and FAE teams there. We've also launched a massive effort in Germany, where we are in the process of training a lot of installers and getting more and more and more installers on board there. 
We will also introduce our storage solution into Europe in the third quarter. As you know, Germany is a big market. It's 1 gigawatt of PV with 80% attach rate because of the feed-in tariffs being so small. So we're very excited about that market. 
But having said that, it's -- say, it's a mature market almost. There are a bunch of suppliers, and we have clear differentiation. It will take us a little bit of time. But with our relentless focus on quality, customer experience, posting the long tail of installers, I'm sure we'll start making significant progress in that region."

We are -- for instance, so we have the microgrid interconnect device or smart switch. Because of that, we don't need an automatic transfer switch, which is what you typically require with a generator integration. So that function is effectively done in software for us. So just by simply the act of connecting the generator into their device, the entire system is now managed by their device and managed by the energy management system. 
There are a few other advantages as a result of the way we integrate everything into the AC domain, is that the generator can now run in parallel to the storage system. So what that means is the homeowner can configure up their system and the system will automatically make decisions such as turn on -- for example, turn on when the grid fails instantly, turn the generator on instantly as soon as a grid fails. Or for example, once a grid fails, you only turn the generator on when the state of charge is at a certain level, and then it turns back off when the state of charge has reached another level. 
Another functionality there is, for example, a quiet period, right? You can configure up all that in software. You can configure it all up saying, ""During this time of the night, don't start generators,"" so you can reduce noise pollution. So it's a very rich experience. You can get to see exactly how the power flow is in real time on your app, so a much, much more well integrated, one-stop shop solution with our end-to-end integrating generator into a common platform."

Remember, we got our Opex, CapEx and other COGS-light business model in the company, right? We don't have manufacturing plants. Our CapEx is going to be higher this year, but at the same time, we can continue operating with the contract manufacturing approach. So this framework should stay like that until -- you can probably get an update when we do our Analysts Day, if there is an update."

So let me cover them once again. Basically, there are several things that can go wrong for the installers on storage. There are some things that we are squarel",572,"No, like what I told earlier, maybe even I answered Brian Lee and I went through the details. So let me cover them once again. 
Basically, there are several things that can go wrong for the installers on storage. There are some things that we are squarely responsible for Enphase. 
Like the installers want to come on to a job site, and they want to finish their install, and they want to leave within 12 hours. And if our commissioning time is excessive, we are going to place burden on installers. And we understand that we are working with them to rapidly reduce that commissioning time. That's an example. 
The second one is very often installers have to come in and rewire the main panel, and that is often several thousands of dollars. If we can help them create a solution which does not need that, that's ease of doing business for the installers. That's number two. 
Number three, as homeowners start to experience these storage systems, they are going to be calling installers often. For example, when you switch from on-grid to off-grid, if you haven't made any adjustments in your lifestyle and your grid is out, your external grid is out, utility grid is out, then you're going to quickly run out of storage in 3 or 4 hours because the air conditioner is going to be on. So therefore, people who do not even know that they are off-grid, run out of storage, and they're out of power and they call installers. And the installers have to go and help them. It's another truck roll for them. That means lost profit for them. 
So how can Enphase help them in order to eliminate all of those problems for installers? Make it so easy that an Enphase system seamlessly provides intelligent notification for homeowners? How can an Enphase system seamlessly provide load control such that the homeowner can automatically set in the app saying, ""When I switch to off-grid, do not turn on my AC."" So you maximize your storage system's life, right? 
And then going back to it all is even when the storage system is being designed in the first place as a consultative sale between the homeowner and the installer, what can Enphase do to make sure that complete transparency to the homeowner, so that it's simple yet complete? And I think those are things that are entirely in Enphase's control, and it will be remiss if we don't take responsibility there. That's one. 
Then I talked about the industry, overall industry. Overall industry, there are problems with permitting cycle times are too long. It's not acceptable. And we all need to do -- our peers all need to fight that battle. 
And the last one is the -- just as financing for solar is getting a lot more mature, financing for storage needs to attain that maturity. And then what happens is you start, more people will start to -- they are comfortable with monthly payments than cash upfront, a lot of cash upfront. 
So those 2 are industry problems that will be working. So it's a combo of Enphase-specific stuff, which we are going to put a lot of energy on, and industry changes that we are going to try to influence. Those are the things we need to do in order to ensure we start ramping much more than our already nice ramp now."

These are the -- many of the comments made by Badri are not unique to Enphase. We are approaching this like we are training installers that they never done an installation before, storage, and they are doing really well with microinverters, so for them to say, ""I need new components, you might salvage a new product,"" convince the homeowner that is a great product. And when they do that, after that, get everything lined up with the crews with the commissioning and do the installation, complete the training and everything, it takes time, right? And right now, they are basically hand to mouth with the microinverter systems, right? 
So we decided to launch with the long tail. That's an investment that we are making. Once they made the investment using our system, we believe they will have a hard time switching to a potential alternative because they are all trained. They know our technology, they know our pitch. 
And then with that concurrently, we have interest from tier 2s and tier 1s that they are sophisticated. They've done installs before. They kind of completed that process with competitor products. And they feel that our product will be an easy trade, right? So all of those things are being attacked at the same time."

We actually gave you megawatt hours, which is a lot better than attach rate, so you can calculate the attach rate. Because it's a complex function of the states you are in. Like for example, the storage may be more popular in California than in some other states. 
So the metrics are different. So we cannot just talk about attach rate without any context, which is why we gave you megawatt hours. So I would not like to talk about attach rates. I like to talk about megawatt hours. 
And like what we talked about, we are growing at a steady clip. Q3 to Q4, 35%; Q4 to Q1, expect a similar rate. And that's what -- that's the progress we are making on megawatt hours."

We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $301.8 million, shipped approximately 2.45 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41.1% and generated strong free cash flow of $81.5 million. 
We exited the first quarter at approximately 41, 14, 27. This means 41% gross margin, 14% operating expenses and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Eric will go into details about our financials later in the call. 
Let's discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q1 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 63% compared to 62% in Q4. And our North America Net Promoter Score was 69% compared to 68% in Q4. 
Our average call wait time in Q1 was more than 5 minutes as we onboarded new installers and fielded calls related to our storage systems. We are working diligently to bring wait times down under a minute. We also expect our 24/7 global customer support to help reduce wait times. The round-the-clock support is another step forward towards delivering an outstanding customer experience and will supplement the Enphase Community and training platforms. 
Let's talk about manufacturing. As we discussed in the last call, the semiconductor supply chain is under stress. In Q1, we experienced constraints on the supply of ASICs and AC FET drivers, which limited shipments. Our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico shipped more than 900,000 microinverters. Our contract manufacturing facility at India shipped nearly 500,000 microinverters. We are very pleased with the production ramp, product quality and manufacturing cost of this fully automated facility in India. Given our strong demand, we are expanding manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India further. 
In Mexico, we are improving operational efficiency and expect to reach quarterly capacity of 1.5 million microinverters. At our facility in Chennai, India, production is around the clock, bringing quarterly capacity to 700,000 microinverters from one manufacturing line. We have already purchased equipment for the second manufacturing line and expect to begin ramping in Q3. 
Looking to Q2, our shipment volumes will be constrained by semiconductor component availability. We have qualified new suppliers for our ASIC and AC FET drivers, which will result in increased shipments for Q2 compared to Q1. But the ramp from these new suppliers is slower than what we had anticipated before. We expect these component constraints to remain for the rest of the year. 
In terms of our Enphase Storage Systems, we shipped 42-megawatt hours in Q1, representing a sequential increase of 30% and in line with our expectations. 
Let's now move to the regions. The U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 82% and 18%, respectively. The U.S. market was quite strong in Q1 despite typical seasonality. U.S. revenue was up 14% sequentially. We achieved very good microinverter sell-through from our distribution partners. I am proud of our operations team for navigating the supply constraints and ensuring customers had continuous supply of product. 
With higher microinverters in -- with higher microinverter shipments in Q1, our channel inventory is better but still tight. With Q2 through Q4 being seasonally robust quarters, we expect the channel tightness for microinverters to continue. 
In Europe, we reported record Q1 revenue. Revenue increased 17% sequentially. We saw strength in Netherlands and France while building on new markets such as Germany, Poland and Austria. 
Our AC module strategy is also gaining momentum in Europe. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems for the European market in the second half of 2021, first in Germany and then in Italy, adding yet another growth driver. I'm very pleased with our performance in Europe. 
In Australia, we had record revenue and record installer count. Q1 revenue was up 58% sequentially. The strong growth of the Enphase Installer Network [indiscernible] and rapid market penetration of our IQ 7A product contributed to our success. 
In addition, we are focusing both on installer and homeowner experience, launching 24/7 customer support, conducting technical training and collaborating on branding initiatives with installers in Australia. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems to Australia also in the second half of 2021. 
In Latin America, Q1 revenue was down a little, 33% from the prior quarter, which had benefited from large storage orders. Puerto Rico continues to be a solid market in terms of both microinverters and storage. 
We are also making plans to enter the Brazilian residential solar market, which is expected to be over 1 gigawatt this year. We have already hired [ Marco ], an experienced sales leader to accelerate our entry into Brazil. 
Now that we have covered the region, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q2. Now once again, our customer demand for Q2 significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We are -- we remain supply-constrained for Q2, as I said before. The component availability is improving but not at the rate of growth in demand. 
While it is very early to talk about Q3, our customer bookings are quite higher than what they would normally be at this time of the quarter. We are planning for much higher capacity in Q3 for both microinverters and storage. We're obviously pleased with the overall demand, but we are cautious about the supply situation, which is not very predictable today. 
Let's now move to our storage system rollout. We shipped 42-megawatt hours of storage systems in Q1, representing sequential growth of approximately 30%. Cumulatively, 623 unique installers commissioned at least one Enphase Storage System by the end of Q1. We're also making good progress with the Tier 1 and 2 installers. We previously announced solar plus storage partnerships with Sunnova, Momentum Solar, Solar Optimum and Power. We expect to announce more partnerships soon. 
Let's now turn to training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q1, we trained 1,776 installers cumulatively online, representing 1,035 unique companies. We plan to resume in-person training soon, beginning with our mobile van training in Texas. Other states will follow suit shortly. 
In addition, we are resuming the build-out of training centers at various distributor locations. As you're aware, we are laser-focused on customer service and making sure we are the easiest company to do business with. With these principles in mind, we started weekly installer round tables in Q1 to understand how we can improve the Enphase storage product. 
The findings are clear: improving the commissioning experience for installers and making life easier for homeowners. By leveraging the feedback, we have made a number of updates to our software and commissioning process. 
Our engineering teams have been working hard to reduce commissioning times on our storage systems from many hours to approximately 2 hours through software improvements and training initiatives. Our goal is a 60-minute commissioning time, which will allow our installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage System in a few hours. 
We expect to release a couple of new features for our Enphase storage system, as discussed in our last earnings call. And these include load control and generator support. Load control is the ability to turn loads on and off. We envision that most homeowners will opt for a full backup of their entire home rather than a partial backup with the capability to shed loads when needed. 
We have 4 circuits for load control designed into our Enphase smart switch. Homeowners can choose up 4 full loads they want to control. For example, an air conditioner can be controlled through one circuit, and a pool pump can be controlled through another circuit. These loads will be on during the grid tight mode and can be shared instantaneously during the off-grid mode simply via the app. 
In addition, excess solar can also be configured to be shed through one of these 4 circuits. This enables the homeowners to save money by not oversizing their battery storage systems. 
The next feature is generator compatibility. Unlike some of the others, there is no need to install a generator ATS when used with Enphase Storage Systems. The generator can plug in to our smart switch called Enpower, which has built in safeguards that ensure generator was only connected to the home when the home is off-grid. When the home is disconnected from the utility, Enphase microinverters in the battery seamlessly form a micro grid to ensure there is no disruption. The lights will not flicker. The clocks will not reset. 
Next, our smart switch starts the standby generator. Once the generator is stable, the system synchronizes the microgrid to the generator's voltage and frequency. Our smart switch then seamlessly connects the home to the generator. 
The Enphase solution provides increased resilience in the off-grid mode by enabling solar, storage and the generators to run together. The generator control will also be integrated into our mobile app so that homeowners have full visibility and control from one app. 
There are 2 modes of operation. One is the basic mode, where the generator simply turns on during an outage. And the other is that the generator can be configured to turn on depending on the state of charge of the battery during an outage. For example, when the battery charge goes below 20% in an outage, the generator returns on, charges the battery, supports the home loads, and once the battery reaches 90%, the generator returns off. 
These are 2 powerful features, and we expect to release them this quarter after beta testing with customers, which is underway. We are seeing a good amount of interest from customers. And these features can be enabled simply by over-the-air software upgrades for existing storage systems, along with some additional minimal work to be done by the installers. 
In summary, we are happy with our Q1 storage shipments reaching 42-megawatt hours. And as I said, we expect to introduce a couple of differentiated new features to improve the homeowner experience. We expect to reduce the commissioning times to improve the installer experience, and we expect to make significant go-to-market changes to improve the brand experience. We expect our storage shipment volumes between 40- and 50-megawatt hours in Q2. 
Let's talk more on upcoming new products. First, I'd like to cover more details on what else is new for storage. In addition to the new features we talked about, we are partnering with aggregators and utilities to enable grid services. This will enable utilities to leverage home battery storage systems instead of turning on peaker plants. And in doing so, the homeowners can get paid for providing that service. 
We have formed a 20% grid services team at Enphase now, consisting of software, product management, business development and policy experts. This team has already made tremendous progress on technical and business fronts, and we plan to expand the team significantly to engage with more utilities and aggregators. 
Final point on storage. We are working hard to introduce the Enphase Storage Systems internationally, as I said before. We want to ensure that all learning from North America is captured and that we are fully staffed to support customers. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems first into Europe and then into Australia in the second half of 2021. 
Let's cover our upcoming IQ 8 and IQ 8D product launches. IQ 8 is the world's first grid-agnostic microinverter for residential solar, and IQ 8D is a high-power microinverter capable of supporting 2 panels for small commercial installer. We are making good progress on the compliance, reliability and system testing on these products. However, with the microinverter supply chain constraints due to semiconductor component shortages, we expect a slower ramp beginning in Q3. We also plan to introduce the Enphase portable power station consumer products in Q4, assuming component shortages are under control. 
Let's now turn to digital transformation. I'm excited about our 2 completed acquisitions, Sofdesk and the solar business of DIN Engineering. The former Sofdesk team, now known as Enphase Montreal, provide design and proposal software for solar and roofing companies. The team acquired from DIN Engineering, now known as Enphase Noida, provides proposal and permitting services to the installers. 
By providing these services to installers, we aim to simplify the sales process while reducing soft costs and providing an enhanced buying experience for homeowners. The obvious opportunity for Enphase is to expand both these offerings to our network of long-tail installers. This is an important initiative for us, and we will be integrating these 2 company operations into our digital platform. 
We have now onboarded 476 installers in North America and 138 installers in Australia to our Enphase Installer Network, EIN, through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. We recently launched our EIN in Europe and India. Our EIN installers enjoy a variety of benefits, including branding, promotion and tools and services on the digital platform to help make sales and installation process faster and easier. 
In summary, we are happy with our performance, and we are pleased with the increased demand for our products. We look forward to introducing our new products, ramping our storage systems, supporting our customers better and accelerating our digital transformation. As always, the health and safety of our employees, the customers and partners remain our top priority as the world continues to be impacted by COVID-19. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. 
Total revenue for Q1 was $301.8 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially. We shipped approximately 830 megawatts DC of microinverter and 42-megawatt hours of storage systems in the first quarter, equivalent to 16.1 megawatts of power. 
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 41.1% compared to 40.2% for Q4. The increase was driven by disciplined pricing and cost management. GAAP gross margin was 40.7% for Q1. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $43.7 million for Q1 compared to $34.2 million for Q4. The sequential increase was primarily due to R&D investments, increased hiring, payroll tax associated with employee stock vesting and first-time consolidation of Sofdesk operations in late January. 
GAAP operating expenses were $61.6 million for Q1 compared to $42.8 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 including $13.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4 million of acquisition, expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets. 
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $80.2 million for Q1 compared to $72.4 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $61.4 million for Q1 compared to $79.1 million for Q4. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $78.7 million compared to $71.3 million for Q4. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for Q1 compared to $0.51 per share for Q4. 
GAAP net income for Q1 was $31.7 million compared to GAAP net income of $73 million for Q4. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.22 for Q1 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.50 for Q4. The GAAP results in the first quarter included a noncash loss of $56.4 million on the partial settlement of convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 or approximately $0.40 on a per share basis. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $34.9 million at the end of Q1 compared to $41.8 million at the end of Q4. The sequential decrease in inventory was driven by an increase in customer demand, coupled with supply constraints. 
Days of inventory outstanding decreased to 18 days compared to 27 days in Q4. This sequential decrease was driven by the lower average inventory balance and higher shipment volumes. Our target is 30 days, but we were hampered by supply cost trends. 
Accounts receivable were $236.1 million at the end of Q1 compared to $182.2 million at the end of Q4. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q1 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter. DSO of 56 days increased from 50 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments. 
We exited Q1 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion compared to $679.4 million for Q4. The cash balance includes net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion for the comparable notes issuance in May 2021, which are partially offset by $304.8 million paid in principal amounts for the partial repurchase and conversions of the convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 and $65.4 million paid for the call spread on the new convertible notes issuance. 
We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. In March, we issued green convertible notes in 2 tranches for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. Both tranches have a 0 coupon. 
The 5-year tranche due 2026 raised gross proceeds of $632.5 million. With a 70% conversion premium, these notes are in the money at the share price of approximately $307. 
The 7-year tranche due 2028 raised gross proceeds of $575 million with a 57.5% conversion premium. This tranche is in the money at the share price of $285. 
Concurrent with the notes offering, we entered into a call spread overlay, which effectively increased the overall conversion price to about $398 per share. The terms of this capital raise were some of the most favorable to an issuer in history. 
We have a very strong cash position on a business that generate healthy free cash flow. We will invest in the business through organic and inorganic activities. We have a CapEx-light business model, which provides for continued investment in new product development, new market entry and marketing to build our brand awareness with homeowners. 
On the acquisition front, we have an active pipeline. And we are careful to only pursue deals with the right strategic and cultural fit, while meeting our return hurdles. 
In Q1, we generated $75.8 million in cash flow from operations and $81.5 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditures was $9.9 million for Q1 to increase manufacturing capacity for both microinverters and storage and costs related to enlighten software app development, corporate website development and office space expansion. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $300 million to $320 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. 
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $70 million to $73 million, including a total of approximately $17 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $53 million to $56 million. All guidance estimates include the contribution from both Sofdesk and DIN for the entire quarter. 
Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. First, given the component supply constraints, we are expediting components and finished goods in Q2 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. Even as component availability starts to improve this quarter, we must rush to get those components into final products into our customers' hands. 
As a result, our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin guidance incorporates a material sequential increase in expedite expense. While we expect Q2 to be the peak, logistics costs will likely remain elevated for the rest of 2021 due to the semiconductor supply chain constraints. 
Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing from Q1 to Q2 due to hiring to support our growth plans, the consolidation of acquisitions and necessary investments in software, branding and the development of IQ 9 and IQ 10 microinverters. It is possible that our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we'll still expect to comfortably exceed our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income. 
Regarding the 2 acquisitions, not only do have the operating expenses of those business, but we also include accruals for the payment of deferred cash consideration. These are cash expenses, which is why we included them in non-GAAP guidance, but there are nonrecurring in nature beyond the specific earnout periods for each acquisition. For Q2, accruals for deferred consideration are expected to be approximately $3.5 million. 
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

First of all, the constraints are only on the solar side, which is solar microinverters.

First of all, the constraints are only on the solar side, which is solar microinverters. And although we are increasing the capacity of solar microinverters every quarter and the demand is increasing every quarter, the supply is unable to keep up with demand because of semiconductor constraints, component constraints. 
The semiconductor component constraints are because of -- mainly because of 2 specific components. One is the ASIC chip that we have. The other is an AC FET driver that drives the gate of the 600-volt transistors. 
And what we have done is on both of them, we have bought on multiple suppliers. For example, on the AC FET drivers, we had 2 suppliers before. Now we are going to have 3 suppliers. On the ASIC, we were producing it in one foundry before. Now we are going to qualify an additional foundry. 
However, our demand is so high for Q2, and we expect a similar demand situation for Q3 that even though our available supply is higher than the prior quarter, it is still not sufficient to meet our demand. This is on the solar side. 
On the storage side, it's pretty simple. We shipped 32-megawatt hours in Q4. We shipped 42-megawatt hours in Q1. That is 30% higher, and we are making tremendous progress there. Our strength in storage is taking care, meaning introduced storage to our long-tail installers. 
And we have trained 1,776 installers, representing 1,035 unique installation companies. That's our bread and butter. These are the folks who are engaged with us on the solar side, and they have started buying storage. We are also engaged with the Tier 1 and 2 customers on storage, and we expect more progress here. 
In addition, like what I said, we have started roundtables every week with our long-tail installers to understand all their pain points. And if I look at it, what are the installer pain points? The storage is still immature as a business for the installers. They have to make multiple trips per home because it is so new. The system sizing tools aren't up to speed yet, which is something we are going to be working on with our Sofdesk acquisition. 
Every job is a custom job. We are trying to standardize that with load control, having whole home backup instead of partial home backup. The homeowners are demanding because all of a sudden, you're now in the path of power. 
And so the sales, meaning the customer service that the installers have to do, is much higher than the storage -- I mean, than the solar side. On top of it, we have permitting delays from the countries because, again, it's a new product and not everybody is used to it. And Enphase can help in all of the above. 
We are going to provide exceptional customer service. We are going to have field service teams to help installers. We bought a company to do solar and storage design software. We bought a company to enable permitting services. And so we have all of the tools to help the installers. 
However, this is going to take time. And that's why you see our growth is steady growth that we are talking about. We grew 35% from Q3 to Q4. We grew 30% from Q4 to Q1. We are growing modestly from Q1 to Q2, but we have no doubt that we are doing the right thing. 
And in addition, the other thing that would spur demand is international locations. It's got to be similar. We are going to take care of long-tail installers internationally. We are going to introduce product imminently second half of the year early into Europe and then into Australia in the latter part of 2021. 
And in addition, I talked about the things we are doing on the homeowner side is introduce load control, which is the ability to turn on and turn off loads. The turning off loads is critical when you're in an off-grid situation so that the homeowner experience is pristine. So we are focused on those. 
And we are also going to up our game on the marketing side. Recently, yes, last quarter, I announced our CMO. And we are going to go all out on that front in terms of promotions, branding, looking at multiple channels, looking at the way we go to market, partnering with loan providers and 24/7 support, field service. We believe all of these tools are necessary, and it will help us make steady progress on storage every quarter. A long answer, but I hope I answered the question."

Seemingly, I wasn't sure if there was some sort of chip constraint for the microinverters that would be using the storage, too, given the same product there. But could you just talk about expectations at the back half and perhaps bring additional suppliers and what that means for capacity into 2022?"

I am working with the CEOs of all 3 companies directly. And for example, on the AC FET drivers, but the situation is stressed globally, and I don't think it is unique to us. Our architecture uses semiconductors, right? So the supply is -- yes, it's what it is.

So follow-up I had you is just maybe a little bit of numbers or quantification. This is the second quarter in a row where you're saying that you have bookings in excess of your guidance. You're basically undershipping demand. 
So maybe just a 2-part question here on the quantification. Can you give us some sense how much you are undershipping demand? Would guidance have been $10 million, $20 million, 10% higher? Just any sense on that? 
And then Eric also made some mention around margins. Q2, you're going to have some peak pressure from a freight cost perspective, but it doesn't get worse. What sort of margin impact is that in the quarter, 100 bps, 200 bps? It doesn't sound like it eases right away, but just trying to get a sense of what that is. 
And then just lastly, if you're seeing some of these cost increases, the tightness, are you raising prices? Are you having those negotiations or discussions with customers? And if not, given your market share position and how critical you are to your customers, why not potentially start to raise prices?"

We are not going to exactly break out what we did for expedite, but it's a big number. And you expect that because when you have supply chain problems, the factories are running hand to mouth. The factories are running hand to mouth, there is no time to put product on a boat. 
The only way we can get product to customers is air ships. Air ships per unit pricing to put a microinverter on the plane is enormous. It's usually 10x or 15x the price that it takes to ship on the ocean as expected. And these are all not new. They are standard. So hopefully, I gave those numbers."

And I think you're seeing -- we look at a midpoint of the guidance that it's been pretty consistent, and we just need a little bit of time to get the supply challenges in the industry figured it out. And from the comment about April today, adding to what Badri said, things changed. It changed quite a bit. 
I mean, the predictability on the level of inventories at the contract manufacturing level and even at the supplier level, it got depleted because of the V-shaped recovery, right? So that created a little bit more variations on the predictability, now relying on purely what is on the line, right? So that created a difficulty for even them to forecast their commitments, right? 
So that's kind of where we are on that. But I think that the -- I feel okay with the margins. I think we got a profitable business, and we don't -- we keep the eye on the ball here."

These are all functions that we progressively want to introduce to existing homes. 
At this point, at least for load control and generator functionality, we are not charging for it. Grid services is a separate story because there is clear financial component there. So once we get ramped up there, we'll figure out how to properly do value-based pricing there. 
But in terms of storage, overall, our pricing strategy has always been value-based. Our pricing will be next best alternative plus the value we had on top of that. Yes, for example, if we -- in micro inverters, for example, is we compare to the competition, that's the next best alternative. 
And then we say, what do we do better? We do quality. Our PPM defects -- defective parts per million, that's much lower. And our customer services is much better. So similar things apply to storage as well. Of course, it's a maturing market, and so we need to be competitive. But we will always follow our value-based pricing story. 
And if we don't add value, then it's pretty clear, right? We are going to be competing against competition. There's going to be price competition, and we never want to be like that.

The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. Today, we have 4 AC high-voltage FETs. They are the 600-volt FET",319,"Right. I mean, it's a good question. The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. 
Today, we have 4 AC high-voltage FETs. They are the 600-volt FETs, 4 600-volt FETs. And then we have 2 AC FET gate drivers, which is where all the shortages. Those 2 AC FET gate drivers are driving the 4 600-volt FETs. So we have 4 plus 2, 6 components there. 
With gallium nitride, what we could do is to collapse 2 of those 600-volt FETs into one. And we could integrate that AC gate driver also into the same package. So 6 discrete components will go to 2 discrete components. 
Of course, cost of gallium nitride will be a little bit higher, but the integration capability is very powerful. And what does that mean is I can run my AC FETs now at a higher frequency. Today, I run them at 100 kilohertz. I can run them at a much higher frequency. 
If I run those if I run those FETs at a higher frequency, then all of a sudden, I can drop my transformer size. My big transformer, which is there in the microinverter, can drop in phase drastically, dropping the footprint. So we are working concurrently on planar transformers in addition to gallium nitride FETs. That's the name of the game. 
If we're able to optimize that properly, there is huge wins for us. And it will help us to increase the power of the microinverter while keeping the cost down, while keeping the footprint down, while keeping the economics intact. So that's what we are working with multiple companies, and it is R&D. It's going to take us 2022 or 2023 to get an IQ 10 product, but IQ 9 will be a little bit before that. But it's R&D."

Now we need to enable storage to also have attractive loans. In order for them to have attractive loans, solar bundling with storage is one option. Having the right warranty structure on storage is another option, and we need to do both.  
And Enphase can help a lot here because that -- this is what we are good at: power electronics, quality and customer experience. So we are thinking hard on working with partners. We have a lot of partners we're working with. And we can change the -- we can basically -- we have to work on the product quality to increase the warranty from 10 years to whatever we can. 
And once we do that, we will unleash loans to become more economical for the homeowners. It will increase the demand that's required for the long-tail installers, right? So it's a long range. Eventually, this has to be done, but we are taking proactive steps to ensure product quality is right."

I think we will be competitive, and we have the right procurement organization to drive those costs down. 
The name of the game in storage is how can we provide outstanding quality and customer experience. It's the same thing which I told you. The long-tail installers need not look storage as a drag on their margins. The storage needs to be a highly profitable business for them. 
Instead of going to the home multiple trips, multiple times for an installation, it should be one and done. The sizing needs to be clear. Installations need to be a cookie-cutter model. The permitting needs to be streamlined. The expectations for the homeowners need to be met. 
So things like load control are extremely critical, right? So we are going to be working on all of those things. And we believe that quality and customer experience will ultimately [indiscernible], and that's what we do for a living. It's a model that has worked well for microinverters without long-tail installers. And now we are going to ramp storage with our long-tail installers. And yes, it is tough. It takes time. It's slow and steady progress, and those are the kinds of businesses we like: healthy, profitable businesses."

First of all, the installer networks, in Europe, there are going to be multiple of them because Europe, you cannot generalize Europe. I think like what you said, Netherlands, our installer network there, they need something else versus installer network in Germany versus the installer network in the U.K. versus the network in Spain versus the network in Poland. That's the first thing to recognize. 
The second thing to recognize is what do they want? What is the rate for them, right? What is the rate for them? The important thing is if they can have one platform on which they can get all kinds of services, that's extremely important for them. New product availability, extremely important for them. 
They want to differentiate themselves from other installers. So they want nothing but the best, right? Like that, I could go on. There are multiple services that they need. 
So depending upon the tier of the installer, we have 3 tiers: platinum installers, gold installers, silver. And the way we categorize those 3 tiers is pretty simple: based upon their quality and based upon how they rate on customer experience that's measured, not by us, by the homeowners. So we rate it like that, and then we make it attractive for platinum installers to be with us in terms of pricing, in terms of services, we do. 
And so -- and we make sure there's healthy competition there. It's a much broader strategy, and we are very cautious in introducing installer networks to every region without adequate planning. So last year, we spent the entire last year introducing installer network for the U.S. and Australia. This year, we just started in Europe. And we will introduce in India as well, but a lot more to come in Europe."

We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $301.8 million, shipped approximately 2.45 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41.1% and generated strong free cash flow of $81.5 million.
We exited the first quarter at approximately 41, 14, 27. This means 41% gross margin, 14% operating expenses and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Eric will go into details about our financials later in the call.
Let's discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q1 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 63% compared to 62% in Q4. And our North America Net Promoter Score was 69% compared to 68% in Q4. Our average call wait time in Q1 was more than 5 minutes as we onboarded new installers and fielded calls related to our storage systems. We are working diligently to bring wait times down under a minute. We also expect our 24/7 global customer support to help reduce wait times. This round-the-clock support is another step forward towards delivering an outstanding customer experience and will supplement the Enphase Community and training platforms.
Let's talk about manufacturing. As we discussed in the last call, the semiconductor supply chain is under stress. In Q1, we experienced constraints on the supply of ASICs and AC FET drivers, which limited shipments. Our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico shipped more than 900,000 microinverters. Our contract manufacturing facility at Salcomp India shipped nearly 500,000 microinverters. We are very pleased with the production ramp, product quality and manufacturing cost of this fully automated facility in India. Given our strong demand, we are expanding manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India further.
In Mexico, we are improving operational efficiency and expect to reach quarterly capacity of 1.5 million microinverters. At our facility in Chennai, India, production is around the clock, bringing quarterly capacity to 700,000 microinverters from one manufacturing line. We have already purchased equipment for the second manufacturing line and expect to begin ramping in Q3.
Looking to Q2, our shipment volumes will be constrained by semiconductor component availability. We have qualified new suppliers for our ASIC and AC FET drivers, which will result in increased shipments for Q2 compared to Q1. But the ramp from these new suppliers is slower than what we had anticipated before. We expect these component constraints to remain for the rest of the year.
In terms of our Enphase Storage Systems, we shipped 42-megawatt hours in Q1, representing a sequential increase of 30% and in line with our expectations.
Let's now move to the regions. The U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 82% and 18%, respectively. The U.S. market was quite strong in Q1 despite typical seasonality. U.S. revenue was up 14% sequentially. We achieved very good microinverter sell-through from our distribution partners. I am proud of our operations team for navigating the supply constraints and ensuring customers had continuous supply of product. With higher microinverter shipments in Q1, our channel inventory is better but still tight. With Q2 through Q4 being seasonally robust quarters, we expect the channel tightness for microinverters to continue.
In Europe, we reported record Q1 revenue. Revenue increased 17% sequentially. We saw strength in Netherlands and France while building on new markets such as Germany, Poland and Austria. Our AC module strategy is also gaining momentum in Europe. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems for the European market in the second half of 2021, first in Germany and then in Italy, adding yet another growth driver. I'm very pleased with our performance in Europe.
In Australia, we had record revenue and record installer count. Q1 revenue was up 58% sequentially. The strong growth of the Enphase Installer Network or EIN and rapid market penetration of our IQ 7A product contributed to our success. In addition, we are focusing both on installer and homeowner experience, launching 24/7 customer support, conducting technical training and collaborating on branding initiatives with installers in Australia. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems to Australia also in the second half of 2021.
In Latin America, Q1 revenue was down a little, 33% from the prior quarter, which had benefited from large storage orders. Puerto Rico continues to be a solid market in terms of both microinverters and storage. We are also making plans to enter the Brazilian residential solar market, which is expected to be over 1 gigawatt this year. We have already hired Marco Krapels, an experienced sales leader, to accelerate our entry into Brazil.
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q2. Now once again, our customer demand for Q2 significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We remain supply-constrained for Q2, as I said before. The component availability is improving but not at the rate of growth in demand.
While it is very early to talk about Q3, our customer bookings are quite higher than what they would normally be at this time of the quarter. We are planning for much higher capacity in Q3 for both microinverters and storage. We're obviously pleased with the overall demand, but we are cautious about the supply situation, which is not very predictable today.
Let's now move to our storage system rollout. We shipped 42-megawatt hours of storage systems in Q1, representing sequential growth of approximately 30%. Cumulatively, 623 unique installers commissioned at least one Enphase Storage System by the end of Q1. We're also making good progress with the Tier 1 and 2 installers. We previously announced solar-plus-storage partnerships with Sunnova, Momentum Solar, Solar Optimum and Powur. We expect to announce more partnerships soon.
Let's now turn to training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q1, we trained 1,776 installers cumulatively online, representing 1,035 unique companies. We plan to resume in-person training soon, beginning with our mobile van training in Texas. Other states will follow suit shortly. In addition, we are resuming the build-out of training centers at various distributor locations.
As you're aware, we are laser-focused on customer service and making sure we are the easiest company to do business with. With these principles in mind, we started weekly installer roundtables in Q1 to understand how we can improve the Enphase storage product. The findings are clear: improving the commissioning experience for installers and making life easier for homeowners. By leveraging the feedback, we have made a number of updates to our software and commissioning process.
Our engineering teams have been working hard to reduce commissioning times on our storage systems from many hours to approximately 2 hours through software improvements and training initiatives. Our goal is a 60-minute commissioning time, which will allow our installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage System in a few hours.
We expect to release a couple of new features for our Enphase Storage System, as discussed in our last earnings call. And these include load control and generator support. Load control is the ability to turn loads on and off. We envision that most homeowners will opt for a full backup of their entire home rather than a partial backup with the capability to shed loads when needed.
We have 4 circuits for load control designed into our Enpower smart switch. Homeowners can choose up to 4 loads they want to control. For example, an air conditioner can be controlled through one circuit and a pool pump can be controlled through another circuit. These loads will be on during the grid tie mode and can be shed instantaneously during the off-grid mode simply via the app. In addition, excess solar can also be configured to be shed through one of these 4 circuits. This enables the homeowners to save money by not oversizing their battery storage systems.
The next feature is generator compatibility. Unlike some of the others, there is no need to install a generator ATS when used with Enphase Storage Systems. The generator can plug into our smart switch called Enpower, which has built-in safeguards that ensure generator is only connected to the home when the home is off-grid. When the home is disconnected from the utility, Enphase microinverters and the battery seamlessly form a microgrid to ensure there is no disruption. The lights will not flicker. The clocks will not reset. Next, our smart switch starts the standby generator. Once the generator is stable, the system synchronizes the microgrid to the generator's voltage and frequency. Our smart switch then seamlessly connects the home to the generator. 
The Enphase solution provides increased resilience in the off-grid mode by enabling solar, storage and the generators to run together. The generator control will also be integrated into our mobile app so that homeowners have full visibility and control from one app. There are 2 modes of operation. One is the basic mode, where the generator simply turns on during an outage. And the other is that the generator can be configured to turn on depending on the state of charge of the battery during an outage. For example, when the battery charge goes below 20% in an outage, the generator turns on, charges the battery, supports the home loads, and once the battery reaches 90%, the generator turns off.
These are 2 powerful features, and we expect to release them this quarter after beta testing with customers, which is underway. We are seeing a good amount of interest from customers. And these features themselves can be enabled simply by over-the-air software upgrades for existing storage systems, along with some additional minimal work to be done by the installers.
In summary, we are happy with our Q1 storage shipment reaching 42-megawatt hours. And as I said, we expect to introduce a couple of differentiated new features to improve the homeowner experience. We expect to reduce the commissioning times to improve the installer experience, and we expect to make significant go-to-market changes to improve the brand experience. We expect our storage shipment volumes between 40- and 50-megawatt hours in Q2.
Let's talk more on upcoming new products. First, I'd like to cover more details on what else is new for storage. In addition to the new features we talked about, we are partnering with aggregators and utilities to enable grid services. This will enable utilities to leverage home battery storage systems instead of turning on peaker plants. And in doing so, the homeowners can get paid for providing that service.
We have formed a 20-person grid services team at Enphase now, consisting of software, product management, business development and policy experts. This team has already made tremendous progress on technical and business fronts, and we plan to expand the team significantly to engage with more utilities and aggregators.
Final point on storage. We are working hard to introduce the Enphase Storage Systems internationally, as I said before. We want to ensure that all learning from North America is captured and that we are fully staffed to support customers. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems first into Europe and then into Australia in the second half of 2021.
Let's cover our upcoming IQ 8 and IQ 8D product launches. IQ 8 is the world's first grid-agnostic microinverter for residential solar, and IQ 8D is a high-power microinverter capable of supporting 2 panels for small commercial solar. We are making good progress on the compliance, reliability and system testing of these products. However, with the microinverter supply chain constraints due to semiconductor component shortages, we expect a slower ramp beginning in Q3. We also plan to introduce the Enphase portable power station consumer product in Q4, assuming component shortages are under control.
Let's now turn to digital transformation. I'm excited about our 2 completed acquisitions, Sofdesk and the solar business of DIN Engineering. The former Sofdesk team, now known as Enphase Montreal, provide design and proposal software for solar and roofing companies. The team acquired from DIN Engineering, now known as Enphase Noida, provides proposal and permitting services to the installers.
By providing these services to installers, we aim to simplify the sales process while reducing soft costs and providing an enhanced buying experience for homeowners. The obvious opportunity for Enphase is to expand both these offerings to our network of long-tail installers. This is an important initiative for us, and we will be integrating these 2 company operations into our digital platform.
We have now onboarded 476 installers in North America and 138 installers in Australia to our Enphase Installer Network, EIN, through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. We recently launched our EIN in Europe and India. Our EIN installers enjoy a variety of benefits, including branding, promotion and tools and services on the digital platform to help make sales and installation process faster and easier.
In summary, we are happy with our performance, and we are pleased with the increased demand for our products. We look forward to introducing our new products, ramping our storage systems, supporting our customers better and accelerating our digital transformation. As always, the health and safety of our employees, the customers and partners remain our top priority as the world continues to be impacted by COVID-19.

We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.
Total revenue for Q1 was $301.8 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially. We shipped approximately 830 megawatts DC of microinverter and 42-megawatt hours of storage systems in the first quarter, equivalent to 16.1 megawatts of power.
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 41.1% compared to 40.2% for Q4. The increase was driven by disciplined pricing and cost management. GAAP gross margin was 40.7% for Q1.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $43.7 million for Q1 compared to $34.2 million for Q4. The sequential increase was primarily due to R&D investments, increased hiring, payroll tax associated with employee stock vesting and first-time consolidation of Sofdesk operations in late January.
GAAP operating expenses were $61.6 million for Q1 compared to $42.8 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $13.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets.
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $80.2 million for Q1 compared to $72.4 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $61.4 million for Q1 compared to $79.1 million for Q4.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $78.7 million compared to $71.3 million for Q4. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for Q1 compared to $0.51 per share for Q4.
GAAP net income for Q1 was $31.7 million compared to GAAP net income of $73 million for Q4. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.22 for Q1 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.50 for Q4. The GAAP results in the first quarter included a noncash loss of $56.4 million on the partial settlement of convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 or approximately $0.40 on a per share basis.
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $34.9 million at the end of Q1 compared to $41.8 million at the end of Q4. The sequential decrease in inventory was driven by an increase in customer demand, coupled with supply constraints.
Days of inventory outstanding decreased to 18 days compared to 27 days in Q4. This sequential decrease was driven by the lower average inventory balance and higher shipment volumes. Our target is 30 days, but we were hampered by supply constraints.
Accounts receivable were $236.1 million at the end of Q1 compared to $182.2 million at the end of Q4. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q1 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter. DSO of 56 days increased from 50 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments.
We exited Q1 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion compared to $679.4 million for Q4. The cash balance includes net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion for the convertible notes issuance in May 2021, which are partially offset by $304.8 million paid in principal amounts for the partial repurchase and conversions of the convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 and $65.4 million paid for the call spread on the new convertible notes issuance.
We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. In March, we issued green convertible notes in 2 tranches for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. Both tranches have 0 coupon.
The 5-year tranche due 2026 raised gross proceeds of $632.5 million. With a 70% conversion premium, these notes are in the money at the share price of approximately $307.
The 7-year tranche due 2028 raised gross proceeds of $575 million with a 57.5% conversion premium. This tranche is in the money at the share price of $285. 
Concurrent with the notes offerings, we entered into a call spread overlay, which effectively increased the overall conversion price to about $398 per share. The terms of this capital raise were some of the most favorable to an issuer in history.
With a very strong cash position and a business that generate healthy free cash flow, we will invest in the business through organic and inorganic activities. We have a CapEx-light business model, which provides for continued investment in new product development, new market entry and marketing to build our brand awareness with homeowners. On the acquisition front, we have an active pipeline. And we are careful to only pursue deals with the right strategic and cultural fit while meeting our return hurdles.
In Q1, we generated $75.8 million in cash flow from operations and $81.5 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditures was $9.9 million for Q1 to increase manufacturing capacity for both microinverters and storage and costs related to Enlighten software app development, corporate website development and office space expansion.
Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $300 million to $320 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses.
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $70 million to $73 million, including a total of approximately $17 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $53 million to $56 million. All guidance estimates include the contribution from both Sofdesk and DIN for the entire quarter.
Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. First, given the component supply constraints, we are expediting components and finished goods in Q2 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. Even as component availability starts to improve this quarter, we must rush to get those components into final products into our customers' hands.
As a result, our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin guidance incorporates a material sequential increase in expedited expense. While we expect Q2 to be the peak, logistics costs will likely remain elevated for the rest of 2021 due to the semiconductor supply chain constraints.
Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing from Q1 to Q2 due to hiring to support our growth plans, the consolidation of acquisitions and necessary investments in software, branding and the development of IQ 9 and IQ 10 microinverters. It is possible that our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we will still expect to comfortably exceed our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income.
Regarding the 2 acquisitions, not only do have the operating expenses of those business, but we also include accruals for the payment of deferred cash consideration. These are cash expenses, which is why we included them in non-GAAP guidance, but they are nonrecurring in nature beyond the specific earnout period for each acquisition. For Q2, accruals for deferred consideration are expected to be approximately $3.5 million.
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

First of all, the constraints are only on the solar side, which is solar microinverters. And although we are increasing the capacity of solar microinverters every quarter and the demand is increasing every quarter, the supply is unable to keep up with demand because of semiconductor constraints, component constraints.
The semiconductor component constraints are mainly because of 2 specific components. One is the ASIC chip that we have. The other is an AC FET driver that drives the gate of the 600-volt transistors. And what we have done is on both of them, we have brought on multiple suppliers. For example, on the AC FET drivers, we had 2 suppliers before. Now we are going to have 3 suppliers. On the ASIC, we were producing it in one foundry before. Now we are going to qualify an additional foundry.
However, our demand is so high for Q2, and we expect a similar demand situation for Q3, that even though our available supply is higher than the prior quarter, it is still not sufficient to meet our demand. This is on the solar side.
On the storage side, it's pretty simple. We shipped 32-megawatt hours in Q4. We shipped 42-megawatt hours in Q1. That is 30% higher, and we are making tremendous progress there. Our strength in storage is taking care, meaning introduce storage to our long-tail installers. And we have trained 1,776 installers, representing 1,035 unique installation companies. That's our bread and butter. These are the folks who are engaged with us on the solar side, and they have started buying storage. We are also engaged with the Tier 1 and 2 customers on storage, and we expect more progress here.
In addition, like what I said, we have started roundtables every week with our long-tail installers to understand all their pain points. And if I look at it, what are the installer pain points? The storage is still immature as a business for the installers. They have to make multiple trips per home because it is so new. The system sizing tools aren't up to speed yet, which is something we are going to be working on with our Sofdesk acquisition.
Every job is a custom job. We are trying to standardize that with load control, having whole home backup instead of partial home backup. The homeowners are demanding because all of a sudden you're now in the path of power. And so the sales, meaning the customer service that the installers have to do is much higher than the storage, I mean, than the solar side. On top of it, we have permitting delays from the counties because, again, it's a new product and not everybody is used to it. And Enphase can help in all of the above.
We are going to provide exceptional customer service. We are going to have field service teams to help the installers. We bought a company to do solar and storage design software. We bought a company to enable permitting services. And so we have all of the tools to help the installers.
However, this is going to take time. And that's why you see our growth is steady growth that we are talking about. We grew 35% from Q3 to Q4. We grew 30% from Q4 to Q1. We are growing modestly from Q1 to Q2, but we have no doubt that we are doing the right thing.
And in addition, the other thing that would spur demand is international locations. It's going to be similar. We are going to take care of long-tail installers internationally. We are going to introduce product imminently second half of the year early into Europe and then into Australia in the latter part of 2021.
And in addition, I talked about the things we are doing on the homeowner side is introduce load control, which is the ability to turn on and turn off loads. The turning of loads is critical when you're in an off-grid situation so that the homeowner experience is pristine. So we are focused on those.
And we are also going to up our game on the marketing side. Recently, yes, last quarter, I announced our CMO. And we are going to go all-out on that front in terms of promotions, branding, looking at multiple channels, looking at the way we go to market, partnering with loan providers and 24/7 support, field service. We believe all of these tools are necessary, and it will help us make steady progress on storage every quarter. A long answer, but I hope I answered the question."

I am working with the CEOs of all 3 companies directly, for example, on the AC FET drivers, but the situation is stressed globally, and I don't think it is unique to us. Our architecture uses semiconductors, right, so the supply is, yes, it's what it is. The good news is, yes, the demand has increased a lot for Q2 and Q3, stressing the supply situation even more.

And so, I mean, it sounds like what you're saying is supply continues to be unpredictable, which makes sense, and then demand has actually probably gotten better. So the follow-up I had here was just maybe a little bit of numbers or quantification. This is the second quarter in a row where you're saying that you have bookings in excess of your guidance. You're basically under-shipping demand. So maybe just a two-part question here on the quantification. Can you give us some sense how much you are under-shipping demand? Would guidance have been $10 million, $20 million, 10% higher, just any sense on that?
And then Eric also made some mention around margins. Q2, you're going to have some peak pressure from a freight cost perspective, but it doesn't get worse. What sort of margin impact is that in the quarter, 100 bps, 200 bps? It doesn't sound like it eases right away, but just trying to get a sense of what that is.
And then just lastly, if you're seeing some of these cost increases and tightness, are you raising prices? Are you having those negotiations or discussions with customers? And if not, given your market share position and how critical you are to your customers, why not potentially start to raise prices?"

We are not going to exactly break out what we did for expedite, but it's a big number. And you expect that because when you have supply chain problems, the factories are running hand to mouth. When the factories are running hand to mouth, there is no time to put product on a boat. The only way we can get product to customers is air ship. Air ship per unit pricing to put a microinverter on the plane is enormous. It's usually 10x or 15x the price that it takes to ship on the ocean as expected. And these are all not new. They are standard. So hopefully, I gave those numbers."

And I think you're seeing, we've got a midpoint of the guidance that has been pretty consistent, and we just need a little bit of time to get the supply challenges in the industry figured out.
And from the comment about April to today, adding to what Badri said, things change, change quite a bit. I mean, the predictability on the level of inventories at the contract manufacturing level and even at the supplier level, it got depleted because of the V-shaped recovery, right? So that created a little bit more variations on the predictability, now relying on purely what is on the line, right? So that created a difficulty for even them to forecast their commitments, right?

These are all functions that we progressively want to introduce to existing homes. At this point, at least for load control and generator functionality, we are not charging for it. Grid services is a separate story because there is clear financial component there. So once we get ramped up there, we'll figure out how to properly do value-based pricing there.
But in terms of storage, overall, our pricing strategy has always been value-based. Our pricing will be next best alternative plus the value we add on top of that. Yes, for example, in microinverters, for example, is we compare to the competition, that's the next best alternative. And then we say, what do we do better? We do quality. Our PPM defects, defective parts per million, that's much lower. And our customer services is much better. So similar things apply to storage as well. Of course, it's a maturing market and so we need to be competitive, but we will always follow our value-based pricing story.
And if we don't add value, then it's pretty clear, right? We are going to be competing against competition. There's going to be price competition. And we never want to be like that.

I mean, there, the story is we're making a lot of progress there, both in terms of the business as well as the product features and compliance. The problem there is mainly with the supply situation uncertain, I don't want to ramp yet another new product with the same components while I'm not servicing my current customers properly.
So that's why I made a decision on, let's make sure that we cautiously ramp that product. But it's a fantastic product. We are working with design tool partners. We have our design and proposal partners we are working with. We are beginning to work with financials. We haven't made too much progress there, but we are beginning to work there. And most of our business right now is focused on North America. That's the first product. And then in 6 months, we will introduce it in Europe as well as Australia, where there's even bigger TAM for small commercial."

The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. Today, we have 4 AC high-voltage FETs. They are the 600-volt FETs,",317,"Right. I mean, it's a good question. The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. Today, we have 4 AC high-voltage FETs. They are the 600-volt FETs, 4 600-volt FETs. And then we have 2 AC FET gate drivers, which is where all the shortage is. Those 2 AC FET gate drivers are driving the 4 600-volt FETs. So we have 4 plus 2, 6 components there.
With gallium nitride, what we could do is to collapse 2 of those 600-volt FETs into one. And we could integrate that AC gate driver also into the same package. So 6 discrete components will go to 2 discrete components. Of course, the cost of gallium nitride will be a little bit higher, but the integration capability is very powerful. And what does that mean is I can run my AC FETs now at a higher frequency. Today, I run them at 100 kilohertz. I can run them at a much higher frequency.
If I run those FETs at a higher frequency, then all of a sudden, I can drop my transformer size. My big transformer, which is there in the microinverter, can drop in size drastically, dropping the footprint. So we are working concurrently on planar transformers in addition to gallium nitride FETs. That's the name of the game.
If we're able to optimize that properly, that is huge win for us. And it will help us to increase the power of the microinverter, while keeping the cost down, while keeping the footprint down, while keeping the economics intact. So that's what we are working with multiple companies. And it is R&D. It's going to take us 2022 or 2023 to get an IQ 10 product, but IQ 9 will be a little bit before that. But it's R&D."

And Enphase can help a lot here because this is what we are good at, power electronics, quality and customer experience. So we are thinking hard on working with partners. We have a lot of partners we're working with. And we have to work on the product quality to increase the warranty from 10 years to whatever we can.

I think we will be competitive and we have the right procurement organization to drive those costs down. The name of the game in storage is how can we provide outstanding quality and customer experience. It's the same thing which I told you. The long-tail installers should not at look storage as a drag on their margins. So storage needs to be a highly profitable business for them. Instead of going to the home multiple trips, multiple times for an installation, it should be one and done. The sizing needs to be clear. Installations need to be a cookie-cutter model. The permitting needs to be streamlined. The expectations for the homeowners need to be met.
So things like load control are extremely critical, right? So we are going to be working on all of those things. And we believe that quality and customer experience will ultimately win. And that's what we do for a living. It's a model that has worked well for microinverters with our long-tail installers. And now we are going to ramp storage with our long-tail installers. And yes, it is tough. It takes time. It's slow and steady progress. And those are the kinds of businesses we like, healthy, profitable businesses."

First of all, the installer networks in Europe, there are going to be multiple of them because Europe, you cannot generalize Europe. I think like what you said, Netherlands, our installer network there, they need something else versus the installer network in Germany, versus the installer network in the U.K., versus the network in Spain, versus the network in Poland. That's the first thing to recognize.
The second thing to recognize is, what do they want? What is the rate for them, right? What is the rate for them? The important thing is if they can have one platform on which they can get all kinds of services, that's extremely important for them. New product availability, extremely important for them. They want to differentiate themselves from other installers. So they want nothing but the best, right? Like that, I could go on. There are multiple services that they need.
So depending upon the tier of the installer, we have 3 tiers: platinum installers, gold installers, silver. And the way we categorize those 3 tiers is pretty simple, based upon their quality and based upon how they rate on customer experience. That's measured not by us, by the homeowners. So we rate it like that and then we make it attractive for platinum installers to be with us in terms of pricing, in terms of services, we do.
And we make sure there's healthy competition there. It's a much broader strategy, and we are very cautious in introducing installer networks to every region without adequate planning. So last year, we spent the entire last year introducing installer network for the U.S. and Australia. This year, we just started in Europe. And we will introduce in India as well, but a lot more to come in Europe."

We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $301.8 million, shipped approximately 2.45 million microinverters, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41.1% and generated strong free cash flow of $81.5 million.
We exited the first quarter at approximately 41, 14, 27. This means 41% gross margin, 14% operating expenses and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Eric will go into details about our financials later in the call.
Let's discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q1 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 63% compared to 62% in Q4. And our North America Net Promoter Score was 69% compared to 68% in Q4. Our average call wait time in Q1 was more than 5 minutes as we onboarded new installers and fielded calls related to our storage systems. We are working diligently to bring wait times down under a minute. We also expect our 24/7 global customer support to help reduce wait times. This round-the-clock support is another step forward towards delivering an outstanding customer experience and will supplement the Enphase Community and training platforms.
Let's talk about manufacturing. As we discussed in the last call, the semiconductor supply chain is under stress. In Q1, we experienced constraints on the supply of ASICs and AC FET drivers, which limited shipments. Our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico shipped more than 900,000 microinverters. Our contract manufacturing facility at Salcomp India shipped nearly 500,000 microinverters. We are very pleased with the production ramp, product quality and manufacturing cost of this fully automated facility in India. Given our strong demand, we are expanding manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India further.
In Mexico, we are improving operational efficiency and expect to reach quarterly capacity of 1.5 million microinverters. At our facility in Chennai, India, production is around the clock, bringing quarterly capacity to 700,000 microinverters from one manufacturing line. We have already purchased equipment for the second manufacturing line and expect to begin ramping in Q3.
Looking to Q2, our shipment volumes will be constrained by semiconductor component availability. We have qualified new suppliers for our ASIC and AC FET drivers, which will result in increased shipments for Q2 compared to Q1. But the ramp from these new suppliers is slower than what we had anticipated before. We expect these component constraints to remain for the rest of the year.
In terms of our Enphase Storage Systems, we shipped 42-megawatt hours in Q1, representing a sequential increase of 30% and in line with our expectations.
Let's now move to the regions. The U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 82% and 18%, respectively. The U.S. market was quite strong in Q1 despite typical seasonality. U.S. revenue was up 14% sequentially. We achieved very good microinverter sell-through from our distribution partners. I am proud of our operations team for navigating the supply constraints and ensuring customers had continuous supply of product. With higher microinverter shipments in Q1, our channel inventory is better but still tight. With Q2 through Q4 being seasonally robust quarters, we expect the channel tightness for microinverters to continue.
In Europe, we reported record Q1 revenue. Revenue increased 17% sequentially. We saw strength in Netherlands and France while building on new markets such as Germany, Poland and Austria. Our AC module strategy is also gaining momentum in Europe. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems for the European market in the second half of 2021, first in Germany and then in Italy, adding yet another growth driver. I'm very pleased with our performance in Europe.
In Australia, we had record revenue and record installer count. Q1 revenue was up 58% sequentially. The strong growth of the Enphase Installer Network or EIN and rapid market penetration of our IQ 7A product contributed to our success. In addition, we are focusing both on installer and homeowner experience, launching 24/7 customer support, conducting technical training and collaborating on branding initiatives with installers in Australia. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems to Australia also in the second half of 2021.
In Latin America, Q1 revenue was down a little, 33% from the prior quarter, which had benefited from large storage orders. Puerto Rico continues to be a solid market in terms of both microinverters and storage. We are also making plans to enter the Brazilian residential solar market, which is expected to be over 1 gigawatt this year. We have already hired Marco Krapels, an experienced sales leader, to accelerate our entry into Brazil.
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q2. Now once again, our customer demand for Q2 significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We remain supply-constrained for Q2, as I said before. The component availability is improving but not at the rate of growth in demand.
While it is very early to talk about Q3, our customer bookings are quite higher than what they would normally be at this time of the quarter. We are planning for much higher capacity in Q3 for both microinverters and storage. We're obviously pleased with the overall demand, but we are cautious about the supply situation, which is not very predictable today.
Let's now move to our storage system rollout. We shipped 42-megawatt hours of storage systems in Q1, representing sequential growth of approximately 30%. Cumulatively, 623 unique installers commissioned at least one Enphase Storage System by the end of Q1. We're also making good progress with the Tier 1 and 2 installers. We previously announced solar-plus-storage partnerships with Sunnova, Momentum Solar, Solar Optimum and Powur. We expect to announce more partnerships soon.
Let's now turn to training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q1, we trained 1,776 installers cumulatively online, representing 1,035 unique companies. We plan to resume in-person training soon, beginning with our mobile van training in Texas. Other states will follow suit shortly. In addition, we are resuming the build-out of training centers at various distributor locations.
As you're aware, we are laser-focused on customer service and making sure we are the easiest company to do business with. With these principles in mind, we started weekly installer roundtables in Q1 to understand how we can improve the Enphase storage product. The findings are clear: improving the commissioning experience for installers and making life easier for homeowners. By leveraging the feedback, we have made a number of updates to our software and commissioning process.
Our engineering teams have been working hard to reduce commissioning times on our storage systems from many hours to approximately 2 hours through software improvements and training initiatives. Our goal is a 60-minute commissioning time, which will allow our installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage System in a few hours.
We expect to release a couple of new features for our Enphase Storage System, as discussed in our last earnings call. And these include load control and generator support. Load control is the ability to turn loads on and off. We envision that most homeowners will opt for a full backup of their entire home rather than a partial backup with the capability to shed loads when needed.
We have 4 circuits for load control designed into our Enpower smart switch. Homeowners can choose up to 4 loads they want to control. For example, an air conditioner can be controlled through one circuit and a pool pump can be controlled through another circuit. These loads will be on during the grid tie mode and can be shed instantaneously during the off-grid mode simply via the app. In addition, excess solar can also be configured to be shed through one of these 4 circuits. This enables the homeowners to save money by not oversizing their battery storage systems.
The next feature is generator compatibility. Unlike some of the others, there is no need to install a generator ATS when used with Enphase Storage Systems. The generator can plug into our smart switch called Enpower, which has built-in safeguards that ensure generator is only connected to the home when the home is off-grid. When the home is disconnected from the utility, Enphase microinverters and the battery seamlessly form a microgrid to ensure there is no disruption. The lights will not flicker. The clocks will not reset. Next, our smart switch starts the standby generator. Once the generator is stable, the system synchronizes the microgrid to the generator's voltage and frequency. Our smart switch then seamlessly connects the home to the generator. 
The Enphase solution provides increased resilience in the off-grid mode by enabling solar, storage and the generators to run together. The generator control will also be integrated into our mobile app so that homeowners have full visibility and control from one app. There are 2 modes of operation. One is the basic mode, where the generator simply turns on during an outage. And the other is that the generator can be configured to turn on depending on the state of charge of the battery during an outage. For example, when the battery charge goes below 20% in an outage, the generator turns on, charges the battery, supports the home loads, and once the battery reaches 90%, the generator turns off.
These are 2 powerful features, and we expect to release them this quarter after beta testing with customers, which is underway. We are seeing a good amount of interest from customers. And these features themselves can be enabled simply by over-the-air software upgrades for existing storage systems, along with some additional minimal work to be done by the installers.
In summary, we are happy with our Q1 storage shipment reaching 42-megawatt hours. And as I said, we expect to introduce a couple of differentiated new features to improve the homeowner experience. We expect to reduce the commissioning times to improve the installer experience, and we expect to make significant go-to-market changes to improve the brand experience. We expect our storage shipment volumes between 40- and 50-megawatt hours in Q2.
Let's talk more on upcoming new products. First, I'd like to cover more details on what else is new for storage. In addition to the new features we talked about, we are partnering with aggregators and utilities to enable grid services. This will enable utilities to leverage home battery storage systems instead of turning on peaker plants. And in doing so, the homeowners can get paid for providing that service.
We have formed a 20-person grid services team at Enphase now, consisting of software, product management, business development and policy experts. This team has already made tremendous progress on technical and business fronts, and we plan to expand the team significantly to engage with more utilities and aggregators.
Final point on storage. We are working hard to introduce the Enphase Storage Systems internationally, as I said before. We want to ensure that all learning from North America is captured and that we are fully staffed to support customers. We expect to introduce Enphase Storage Systems first into Europe and then into Australia in the second half of 2021.
Let's cover our upcoming IQ 8 and IQ 8D product launches. IQ 8 is the world's first grid-agnostic microinverter for residential solar, and IQ 8D is a high-power microinverter capable of supporting 2 panels for small commercial solar. We are making good progress on the compliance, reliability and system testing of these products. However, with the microinverter supply chain constraints due to semiconductor component shortages, we expect a slower ramp beginning in Q3. We also plan to introduce the Enphase portable power station consumer product in Q4, assuming component shortages are under control.
Let's now turn to digital transformation. I'm excited about our 2 completed acquisitions, Sofdesk and the solar business of DIN Engineering. The former Sofdesk team, now known as Enphase Montreal, provide design and proposal software for solar and roofing companies. The team acquired from DIN Engineering, now known as Enphase Noida, provides proposal and permitting services to the installers.
By providing these services to installers, we aim to simplify the sales process while reducing soft costs and providing an enhanced buying experience for homeowners. The obvious opportunity for Enphase is to expand both these offerings to our network of long-tail installers. This is an important initiative for us, and we will be integrating these 2 company operations into our digital platform.
We have now onboarded 476 installers in North America and 138 installers in Australia to our Enphase Installer Network, EIN, through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. We recently launched our EIN in Europe and India. Our EIN installers enjoy a variety of benefits, including branding, promotion and tools and services on the digital platform to help make sales and installation process faster and easier.
In summary, we are happy with our performance, and we are pleased with the increased demand for our products. We look forward to introducing our new products, ramping our storage systems, supporting our customers better and accelerating our digital transformation. As always, the health and safety of our employees, the customers and partners remain our top priority as the world continues to be impacted by COVID-19.
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.
Total revenue for Q1 was $301.8 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially. We shipped approximately 830 megawatts DC of microinverter and 42-megawatt hours of storage systems in the first quarter, equivalent to 16.1 megawatts of power.
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 41.1% compared to 40.2% for Q4. The increase was driven by disciplined pricing and cost management. GAAP gross margin was 40.7% for Q1.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $43.7 million for Q1 compared to $34.2 million for Q4. The sequential increase was primarily due to R&D investments, increased hiring, payroll tax associated with employee stock vesting and first-time consolidation of Sofdesk operations in late January.
GAAP operating expenses were $61.6 million for Q1 compared to $42.8 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $13.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets.
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $80.2 million for Q1 compared to $72.4 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $61.4 million for Q1 compared to $79.1 million for Q4.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $78.7 million compared to $71.3 million for Q4. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for Q1 compared to $0.51 per share for Q4.
GAAP net income for Q1 was $31.7 million compared to GAAP net income of $73 million for Q4. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.22 for Q1 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.50 for Q4. The GAAP results in the first quarter included a noncash loss of $56.4 million on the partial settlement of convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 or approximately $0.40 on a per share basis.
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $34.9 million at the end of Q1 compared to $41.8 million at the end of Q4. The sequential decrease in inventory was driven by an increase in customer demand, coupled with supply constraints.
Days of inventory outstanding decreased to 18 days compared to 27 days in Q4. This sequential decrease was driven by the lower average inventory balance and higher shipment volumes. Our target is 30 days, but we were hampered by supply constraints.
Accounts receivable were $236.1 million at the end of Q1 compared to $182.2 million at the end of Q4. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q1 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter. DSO of 56 days increased from 50 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments.
We exited Q1 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion compared to $679.4 million for Q4. The cash balance includes net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion for the convertible notes issuance in May 2021, which are partially offset by $304.8 million paid in principal amounts for the partial repurchase and conversions of the convertible notes due 2024 and 2025 and $65.4 million paid for the call spread on the new convertible notes issuance.
We did not make any share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization. In March, we issued green convertible notes in 2 tranches for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. Both tranches have 0 coupon.
The 5-year tranche due 2026 raised gross proceeds of $632.5 million. With a 70% conversion premium, these notes are in the money at the share price of approximately $307.
The 7-year tranche due 2028 raised gross proceeds of $575 million with a 57.5% conversion premium. This tranche is in the money at the share price of $285. 
Concurrent with the notes offerings, we entered into a call spread overlay, which effectively increased the overall conversion price to about $398 per share. The terms of this capital raise were some of the most favorable to an issuer in history.
With a very strong cash position and a business that generate healthy free cash flow, we will invest in the business through organic and inorganic activities. We have a CapEx-light business model, which provides for continued investment in new product development, new market entry and marketing to build our brand awareness with homeowners. On the acquisition front, we have an active pipeline. And we are careful to only pursue deals with the right strategic and cultural fit while meeting our return hurdles.
In Q1, we generated $75.8 million in cash flow from operations and $81.5 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditures was $9.9 million for Q1 to increase manufacturing capacity for both microinverters and storage and costs related to Enlighten software app development, corporate website development and office space expansion.
Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $300 million to $320 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses.
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $70 million to $73 million, including a total of approximately $17 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $53 million to $56 million. All guidance estimates include the contribution from both Sofdesk and DIN for the entire quarter.
Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. First, given the component supply constraints, we are expediting components and finished goods in Q2 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. Even as component availability starts to improve this quarter, we must rush to get those components into final products into our customers' hands.
As a result, our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin guidance incorporates a material sequential increase in expedited expense. While we expect Q2 to be the peak, logistics costs will likely remain elevated for the rest of 2021 due to the semiconductor supply chain constraints.
Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are increasing from Q1 to Q2 due to hiring to support our growth plans, the consolidation of acquisitions and necessary investments in software, branding and the development of IQ 9 and IQ 10 microinverters. It is possible that our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we will still expect to comfortably exceed our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income.
Regarding the 2 acquisitions, not only do have the operating expenses of those business, but we also include accruals for the payment of deferred cash consideration. These are cash expenses, which is why we included them in non-GAAP guidance, but they are nonrecurring in nature beyond the specific earnout period for each acquisition. For Q2, accruals for deferred consideration are expected to be approximately $3.5 million.
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

40485464,711192825,2259989,"Enphase Energy, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Enphase Energy, Inc.","Executives","So let me first make a couple of things clear. First of all, the constraints are only on the solar side, which is solar microinverters. And although we are increasing the capacity of solar microinverters every quarter and the demand is increasing every qu",773,"So let me first make a couple of things clear. First of all, the constraints are only on the solar side, which is solar microinverters. And although we are increasing the capacity of solar microinverters every quarter and the demand is increasing every quarter, the supply is unable to keep up with demand because of semiconductor constraints, component constraints.
The semiconductor component constraints are mainly because of 2 specific components. One is the ASIC chip that we have. The other is an AC FET driver that drives the gate of the 600-volt transistors. And what we have done is on both of them, we have brought on multiple suppliers. For example, on the AC FET drivers, we had 2 suppliers before. Now we are going to have 3 suppliers. On the ASIC, we were producing it in one foundry before. Now we are going to qualify an additional foundry.
However, our demand is so high for Q2, and we expect a similar demand situation for Q3, that even though our available supply is higher than the prior quarter, it is still not sufficient to meet our demand. This is on the solar side.
On the storage side, it's pretty simple. We shipped 32-megawatt hours in Q4. We shipped 42-megawatt hours in Q1. That is 30% higher, and we are making tremendous progress there. Our strength in storage is taking care, meaning introduce storage to our long-tail installers. And we have trained 1,776 installers, representing 1,035 unique installation companies. That's our bread and butter. These are the folks who are engaged with us on the solar side, and they have started buying storage. We are also engaged with the Tier 1 and 2 customers on storage, and we expect more progress here.
In addition, like what I said, we have started roundtables every week with our long-tail installers to understand all their pain points. And if I look at it, what are the installer pain points? The storage is still immature as a business for the installers. They have to make multiple trips per home because it is so new. The system sizing tools aren't up to speed yet, which is something we are going to be working on with our Sofdesk acquisition.
Every job is a custom job. We are trying to standardize that with load control, having whole home backup instead of partial home backup. The homeowners are demanding because all of a sudden you're now in the path of power. And so the sales, meaning the customer service that the installers have to do is much higher than the storage, I mean, than the solar side. On top of it, we have permitting delays from the counties because, again, it's a new product and not everybody is used to it. And Enphase can help in all of the above.
We are going to provide exceptional customer service. We are going to have field service teams to help the installers. We bought a company to do solar and storage design software. We bought a company to enable permitting services. And so we have all of the tools to help the installers.
However, this is going to take time. And that's why you see our growth is steady growth that we are talking about. We grew 35% from Q3 to Q4. We grew 30% from Q4 to Q1. We are growing modestly from Q1 to Q2, but we have no doubt that we are doing the right thing.
And in addition, the other thing that would spur demand is international locations. It's going to be similar. We are going to take care of long-tail installers internationally. We are going to introduce product imminently second half of the year early into Europe and then into Australia in the latter part of 2021.
And in addition, I talked about the things we are doing on the homeowner side is introduce load control, which is the ability to turn on and turn off loads. The turning of loads is critical when you're in an off-grid situation so that the homeowner experience is pristine. So we are focused on those.
And we are also going to up our game on the marketing side. Recently, yes, last quarter, I announced our CMO. And we are going to go all-out on that front in terms of promotions, branding, looking at multiple channels, looking at the way we go to market, partnering with loan providers and 24/7 support, field service. We believe all of these tools are necessary, and it will help us make steady progress on storage every quarter. A long answer, but I hope I answered the question."

Would guidance have been $10 million, $20 million, 10% higher, just any sense on that?
And then Eric also made some mention around margins. Q2, you're going to have some peak pressure from a freight cost perspective, but it doesn't get worse.

Oh, the third question, pricing. I'm not changing pricing. The second question on the, yes, the second question on gross margin. Our gross margin guidance, non-GAAP is 38% to 41%. We are not going to exactly break out what we did for expedite, but it's a big number. And you expect that because when you have supply chain problems, the factories are running hand to mouth. When the factories are running hand to mouth, there is no time to put product on a boat. The only way we can get product to customers is air ship. Air ship per unit pricing to put a microinverter on the plane is enormous. It's usually 10x or 15x the price that it takes to ship on the ocean as expected. And these are all not new. They are standard. So hopefully, I gave those numbers."

And I think you're seeing, we've got a midpoint of the guidance that has been pretty consistent, and we just need a little bit of time to get the supply challenges in the industry figured out.
And from the comment about April to today, adding to what Badri said, things change, change quite a bit. I mean, the predictability on the level of inventories at the contract manufacturing level and even at the supplier level, it got depleted because of the V-shaped recovery, right? So that created a little bit more variations on the predictability, now relying on purely what is on the line, right? So that created a difficulty for even them to forecast their commitments, right?

These are all functions that we progressively want to introduce to existing homes. At this point, at least for load control and generator functionality, we are not charging for it. Grid services is a separate story because there is clear financial component there. So once we get ramped up there, we'll figure out how to properly do value-based pricing there.
But in terms of storage, overall, our pricing strategy has always been value-based. Our pricing will be next best alternative plus the value we add on top of that. Yes, for example, in microinverters, for example, is we compare to the competition, that's the next best alternative. And then we say, what do we do better? We do quality. Our PPM defects, defective parts per million, that's much lower. And our customer services is much better. So similar things apply to storage as well. Of course, it's a maturing market and so we need to be competitive, but we will always follow our value-based pricing story.
And if we don't add value, then it's pretty clear, right? We are going to be competing against competition. There's going to be price competition. And we never want to be like that.

The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. Today, we have 4 AC high-voltage FETs. They are the 600-volt FETs,",317,"Right. I mean, it's a good question. The reason why we are doing it is to reduce the footprint, to increase power, to increase efficiency and drop costs. And I'll give you a quick example. Today, we have 4 AC high-voltage FETs. They are the 600-volt FETs, 4 600-volt FETs. And then we have 2 AC FET gate drivers, which is where all the shortage is. Those 2 AC FET gate drivers are driving the 4 600-volt FETs. So we have 4 plus 2, 6 components there.
With gallium nitride, what we could do is to collapse 2 of those 600-volt FETs into one. And we could integrate that AC gate driver also into the same package. So 6 discrete components will go to 2 discrete components. Of course, the cost of gallium nitride will be a little bit higher, but the integration capability is very powerful. And what does that mean is I can run my AC FETs now at a higher frequency. Today, I run them at 100 kilohertz. I can run them at a much higher frequency.
If I run those FETs at a higher frequency, then all of a sudden, I can drop my transformer size. My big transformer, which is there in the microinverter, can drop in size drastically, dropping the footprint. So we are working concurrently on planar transformers in addition to gallium nitride FETs. That's the name of the game.
If we're able to optimize that properly, that is huge win for us. And it will help us to increase the power of the microinverter, while keeping the cost down, while keeping the footprint down, while keeping the economics intact. So that's what we are working with multiple companies. And it is R&D. It's going to take us 2022 or 2023 to get an IQ 10 product, but IQ 9 will be a little bit before that. But it's R&D."

The long-tail installers should not look storage as a drag on their margins. So storage needs to be a highly profitable business for them. Instead of going to the home multiple trips, multiple times for an installation, it should be one and done. The sizing needs to be clear. Installations need to be a cookie-cutter model. The permitting needs to be streamlined. The expectations for the homeowners need to be met.
So things like load control are extremely critical, right? So we are going to be working on all of those things. And we believe that quality and customer experience will ultimately win.

And the way we categorize those 3 tiers is pretty simple, based upon their quality and based upon how they rate on customer experience. That's measured not by us, by the homeowners. So we rate it like that and then we make it attractive for platinum installers to be with us in terms of pricing, in terms of services, we do.
And we make sure there's healthy competition there. It's a much broader strategy, and we are very cautious in introducing installer networks to every region without adequate planning. So last year, we spent the entire last year introducing installer network for the U.S. and Australia. This year, we just started in Europe. And we will introduce in India as well, but a lot more to come in Europe."

We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $316.1 million, shipped approximately 2.36 million microinverters and 43-megawatt hours of Enphase storage",2053,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $316.1 million, shipped approximately 2.36 million microinverters and 43-megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8%, and generated strong free cash flow of $49.2 million. We exited the second quarter at approximately 41%, 16%, 24%. This means 41% gross margin, 16% operating expenses and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. Eric will go into details about our finances later in the call.
Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q2 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 67% compared to 63% in Q1. And our North American Net Promoter Score was 71% compared to 69% in Q1. Our average call wait time decreased to approximately 3 minutes in Q2 from more than 5 minutes in Q1. Our 24/7 global customer support helped to reduce the wait times. In addition, we are building field service teams in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers. We also expect to add a team in Australia during Q4. We remain laser focused on customer service and making sure that we are the easiest company to do business with.
Let's now talk about manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past earnings calls, the demand for our microinverter systems continues to be well ahead of supply. In Q2, we experienced component constraints on the supplier AC Fed drivers, which resulted in our microinverter shipment volume slightly lower as compared to Q1. We had 3 AC Fed driver suppliers qualified by the end of the second quarter compared to 2 in the first quarter.
For the third quarter, we continue to expect to remain constrained on microinverters. But the supply situation is better than what it was in the second quarter. We expect to have 4 suppliers qualified by the end of the third quarter. Regarding the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the situation will be significantly better compared to the third quarter.
On the ASIC used in our microinverters, we have sufficient supply. So that has not been a big constraint so far. As previously discussed, we are expanding our microinverter manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India. At our facility in India, we installed a second fully automated line in Q2, with production beginning at the end of the quarter. This brings our quarterly capacity to 1.5 million microinverters from India.
In Mexico, we expect to add a fully automated manufacturing line in Q4. This will bring quarterly capacity to approximately 2.2 million microinverters in Mexico. With our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2021.
Let's talk about batteries. We have 2 sources for battery cell packs with a total capacity of 120-megawatt hours per quarter. I previously mentioned, we are going to add a third source in 2022 to increase our overall capacity. Talking about our lead times, our lead times for storage systems are a little high today between 12 and 14 weeks. -- and we are working on streamlining our engineering and manufacturing to bring them down below 10 weeks by the end of 2021.
Let's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 81% and 19%, respectively. The U.S. market demand was very strong in Q2, but we were supply constrained. Therefore, revenue was only up 3% sequentially. Our teams work hard to ensure customers that continuous supply of product. The sell-through from our distribution partners to installers remained very strong, keeping channel inventory tight, but at manageable levels. Our teams ensured that all customers had product that they needed to complete jobs, and we're not forced to seek automative, although the constrained supply prevented customers from building buffer inventory.
In Europe, we reported record revenue in Q2. The revenue increased 16% sequentially. The channel inventory was much tighter in Europe than the U.S., but we expect it to improve in Q3 and Q4. We had solid growth in Netherlands, France and Germany, and continued strong microinverter sales to Maxeon for its ACM product during the second quarter. We also began selling our Enphase storage systems in Germany during late Q2, representing the product's first international expansion outside the U.S. We launched our solar plus storage system estimator sizing tool in Germany that showcases panel placement on the roof, along with storage sizing and a comprehensive financial analysis.
Germany represents the largest residential storage market in Europe with high attach rates. The market response to the introduction of the Enphase storage system in Germany has been positive, and we expect this to also drive the microinverter business in the country. Overall, I'm very pleased with our growth in Europe.
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue declined 3% sequentially in Q2, primarily due to COVID disruptions in Australia, along with normal seasonality. Despite these headwinds, we are quite happy with microinverter sales during the second quarter from the continued adoption of our highest power IQ 7A product and our AC module partnerships. We expect to pilot Enphase storage systems in Australia in the fourth quarter.
In Latin America, Q2 revenue was up 38% sequentially, largely due to increased sales of both Enphase solar and storage systems in Puerto Rico. As I discussed last quarter, we are expanding into Brazil. We have hired a team there to enter the Brazilian market, and we expect first revenue from this region in Q3.
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q3. Our overall customer demand for Q3 once again significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We continue to remain supply constrained in Q3. Our component availability is improving in Q3 compared to Q2, but not at the rate of growth in demand.
Let's now move to our storage systems rollout. We shipped 43-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the second quarter. During the quarter, we released load control, a new feature that provides Enphase storage systems with the capability to automatically shed nonessential loads during an outage. With load control homeowners have the option to conserve their energy consumption and extend their backup duration simply via a onetime setting of the Enlighten app.
Let's now turn to training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q2, we trained 2,592 installers cumulatively, representing more than 1,500 unique installation companies. This represents a significant jump compared to Q1 as we were able to resume some in-person training in Q2. We also continue to make steady progress on the commissioning of our Enphase Storage Systems and made numerous updates to our software app. Our goal remains a sub-60-minute commissioning time, which will allow installers to visit the site, install and commission and Enphase Storage System in less than a few hours. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on that front.
The introduction of load control in late May, along with some pricing adjustments we did for our installers, plus the improvements in the commissioning process has resulted in an acceleration of demand for Enphase storage since June. As a result, we expect to ship between 60 and 70-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the third quarter. We are already fully booked for Q3 on storage. And our current lead times, as I said before, are 12 to 14 weeks. We are working hard to bring the lead times down to under 10 weeks.
Let's talk about our new products, specifically the IQ 8 microinverter and the IQ 8D microinverter product launches. IQ 8 is the world's first grid independent microinverter for residential solar. And IQ 8 is the high-power 640-watt AC microinverter, capable of supporting 2 panels for small commercial solar. We are making good progress in the compliance, reliability and system testing of these products. We expect first shipments of the IQ 8 PV microinverters in Q3, and first shipments of the IQ 8D product in Q4. Given our component supply challenges, we are going to ramp these products quite cautiously.
On the last earnings call, we discussed the generator compatibility feature for our Enphase Storage Systems last quarter. We are a little bit behind here as we took more time to complete the system testing. We are currently piloting generator compatibility with a handful of real homes and are seeing great results. We expect to introduce this feature introduction by the end of the third quarter. Homeowners will then have the ability to add generators to their Enphase Storage Systems, and will be able to configure the generator behavior from the Enphase app.
The Enphase Home Energy Management system provides a seamless transition from on-grid to off-grid ensuring a superior installer and no molar experience. This generator functionality, as I said, will be integrated into our mobile app so the homeowners have full visibility and control from 1 app.
Let's now turn to digital transformation. Both our recent acquisitions, Softdesk and the solar business of BIN Engineering are fully integrated and exceeded our expectations with record revenue and installer accounts in Q2. The 850-plus installers using the solar graft software tool will soon have access to new features such as shading and storage system sizing. Our permitting services are also undergoing significant improvements towards automation to drive mass adoption amongst the long tail of installers. Our digital transformation initiatives focused on reducing staff costs, while improving profitability and efficiency for our installers, resulting in clean and affordable energy for all.
Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded 500 installers in North America, 146 installers in Australia and 169 installers in Europe to our Enphase Installer Network through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. We also introduced EIN networks in India and Mexico during the second quarter. This has been a highly successful initiative as we are adding trusted installers who will act as product evangelists on our behalf and are expected to provide an exceptional experience to homeowners.
Let's talk about our entry into grid services for the first time. We have started participating in the Connected Solutions program, which is an incentive program implemented by 2 utilities in the Northeast region of the United States to reduce electrical demand during the high use periods. Enphase storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island can sign up, monitor, track money on and control participation in the program using our Enlighten mobile app. These grid services programs enable utilities to leverage Enphase Storage Systems instead of turning on polluting peak plants while generating an income stream for the battery owner.
Enphase customers participating in the connected solutions program can receive up to $1,500 a year for our 10-kilowatt hour battery once they share the battery when they -- when called upon by the utility. Facilitating grid services participation for our customers will reduce the lifetime cost of Enphase storage systems and help drive increased demand. We plan to participate in more such programs in the future.
Enphase is laser focused on building best-in-class home energy management systems and delivering them to homeowners through our digital platform, along with our Enphase Installer Network and distribution partners. We now have solar, storage load control grid services and generator compatibility as part of our home energy management system. We plan on adding other distributed energy resources down the line.
Our digital platform captures both installer and homeowner journeys, providing tools and services such as design, proposal and permitting with the goal of reducing soft costs and accelerating the adoption of clean energy.
In summary, we are very happy with the performance in the first half of 2021 and the ongoing strong demand for our solar and storage products. We look forward to the ramping of our storage systems, introducing new products, accelerating digital transformation and enhancing customer experience. We plan to host an Analyst Day in the fourth quarter, and will provide more details on our next quarter's earnings call.
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Total revenue for Q2 was $316.1 million, representing an increase of 5% sequentially. We shipped approximately 796 megawatts DC of microinverters and 43-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the quarter. Microinverter unit shipments declined slightly relative to Q1 and but favorable product mix led to the sequential revenue growth.
Non-GAAP gross margins for Q2 was 40.8% compared to 41.1% for Q1. The decrease was primarily as a result of higher logistics and expedite costs, partially offset by disciplined pricing and favorable mix. GAAP gross margin was 40.4% for Q2.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $51.7 million for Q2 compared to $43.7 million for Q1. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investment in R&D and sales and marketing programs and increased hiring. In addition, Q2 was the first full quarter of consolidation of the recent acquisitions of Softdesk and BIN.
GAAP operating expenses were $68.4 million for Q2 compared to $61.6 million for Q1 GAAP operating expenses for Q2, including $14.3 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $2.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $77.2 million for Q2 compared to $80.2 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $59.4 million for Q2 compared to $61.4 million for Q1.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $74.7 million compared to $78.7 million for Q1. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.53 for Q2 compared to $0.56 per share for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $39.4 million compared to GAAP net income of $31.7 million for Q1. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.28 for Q2 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.22 for Q1.
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $37.8 million at the end of Q2 compared to $34.9 million at the end of Q1. The sequential increase was driven by higher battery cell pack inventory to support the expected growth of Enphase Energy Store System shipment. This inventory outstanding was unchanged compared to Q1 and stood at 18 days, reflecting the current supply-constrained environment as well as longer lead times.
Accounts receivable were $281.2 million at the end of Q2 compared to $236.1 million at the end of Q1. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q2 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter. DSO of 65 days increased from 56 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments.
We exited Q2 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion compared to approximately $1.5 billion for Q1. We fully utilize our $200 million share repurchase authorization and bought approximately 1.7 million shares at an average share price of approximately $117 in Q2. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million over the next 3 years. In Q2, we generated $65.6 million in cash flow from operations and $49.2 million in free cash flow.
Capital expenditure was $16.4 million for Q2 to expand my competitor manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India as well for costs related to Enlighten software app development, corporate website development, and investment in IT and cloud infrastructure.
Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We expect our revenues for the quarter to be within a range of $335 million to $355 million, which includes shipments of 60- to 70-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $105 million to $108 million, including a total of approximately $46.4 million, estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and $1.6 million, estimated for acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $57 million to $60 million.
Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. As Badri mentioned earlier, we will be constrained by component availability in Q3. The revenue guidance assumes a modest increase in microinverter shipments, but the primary driver of growth will come from increased storage systems.
We expect to ship 60- to 70-megawatt hours of our Enphase Storage Systems in Q3, representing approximately 50% sequential growth at the midpoint. We expect improved component availability for microinverter production in Q4 and continued momentum for the Enphase Storage Systems.
On the cost side, we are continuing to expedite components and finished goods in Q3 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. To put in the magnitude of expedite cost into perspective, the expense in Q2 was larger than for all of 2020. We expect the quarterly expedited expenses to remain at similar levels for the remainder of 2021. Due to the elevated logistics costs and increase in some component costs, we implemented a modest price increase for microinverters starting in Q3.
Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase in Q3. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we will still expect to be comfortably above our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income as we accelerate towards our vision of providing best-in-class home energy management systems. We are investing significantly in R&D, particularly in areas that further our competitive advantage such as ASIC and so forth.
Semiconductor integration and cloud software are core differentiation that increase our system performance, reduce cost and increase reliability. We are also ramping up our marketing expense in the back half of the year to increase homeowner awareness of our solutions. For Q3 accruals for post-combination expenses from prior acquisitions are expected to be approximately $3.4 million.
Finally, I will touch on an increase of the stock-based compensation expense in Q3. The sequential increase is due to the higher number of employees globally as we continue to accelerate our growth plans as well as the need to retain top-level employees as an S&P 500 company.
With that, I will now open the lines for questions."

We qualified a third supplier in the second quarter, we were living hand to mouth in the second quarter, and you saw the results. The situation is getting better day by day. So in the third quarter, I expect to do more number of microinverters, I expect to qualify 1 more supplier. Still, the semi-supply chain is stressed, though, which is why I cannot meet all my demand. In the fourth quarter, I see I see better visibility right now.
But look, I predicted that in the first quarter, we are going to be out of the world soon, that was not the case. So I remain cautiously optimistic that the situation is going to get better.

Our battery solution, 3.3 kilowatt hour is a modular solution, creating a lot of flexibility for our installers. Our chemistry is a lithium ion phosphate chemistry that is excellent in fire safety.
In addition, we focused on power when you start conditioners, you do need a soft startup, but with our feature called Power start, we are able to provide extra power for that surge when the air conditioners turn on. Those value propositions have largely remained intact.
Then you asked about market feedback. Our customers gave us a lot of feedback. Our initial commissioning times we're not that good. They were -- the commissioning times were of the order of several lowers and customers did not like that. Installers did not like that. They gave us a lot of feedback. We took all of that feedback into perspective, and we improved our commissioning process a lot. We have learned a lot in the last year. Home owners also gave us valuable feedback in terms of in terms of micro grid failures like, for example, how do we provide the right notification to the homeowners, so that they know that, okay, now I am in off-grid more, in an outage mode, and I need to take extra steps to conserve my battery life.
So we learned a lot from homeowners. We updated our software multiple, multiple times during the last year. And recently, in May, we introduced load control. Load control was extremely important because for the people who have, let's say, a lot of air conditioners, they don't want to screw around with doing a partial home backup. You can do a whole home backup and you can leave out the air conditioners by default, you can shed the loads automatically. So we provide now as of late May, we introduced 4 circuit load control. So heavy loads can be automatically shared through a onetime app setting.
Now you heard me talking about generator compatibility. We -- pretty soon by the end of by the end of the quarter, we will be introducing again through software, our home energy management system will incorporate generators to plug into them, giving homeowners unprecedented visibility and control from 1 app. Additional things with it. We introduced 24/7 customer support. We have -- we now have a field service team which will help the installers with the installers find it invaluable. We have roundtables, weekly roundtables. I personally meet with 10 to 15 installers every week, get their feedback and make continuous corrections to the product.
Now let's talk about pricing. The introduction in the last 1 year was by design. I wouldn't have changed much. We learned a lot. Our costs initially were high as typical in a ramp. Our pricing was therefore a little bit high. And now I have learned a lot from the field, we have improved the commissioning process, and we introduced load control. So we felt it was the time to make the right pricing adjustment while being very disciplined and doing value-based pricing. So we did exactly that in late May, along with load control, along with the latest commissioning improvements, we even introduced [indiscernible] our 15-year warranty plan. we find it at the right time to make a pricing adjustment, which we did. And we have seen since June enormous acceleration in storage demand, which is why we are guiding 50% from Q2 shipments. Q3 guidance, midpoint of guidance will be up 50% from Q2 shipments.
Now we got to do one thing. We need to improve our lead times on batteries. When I mean 12 to 14 weeks, if somebody orders the battery today from me, they can only get the battery in 12 to 14 weeks, which is not acceptable. I need to go work on streamlining both engineering, manufacturing cycle time in order to push that down to under 10 weeks, ideally 8 weeks. So that's something that I have to do. And I do need to get a third supplier because I see that I see us doing well. I've become more optimistic on batteries. We do need a 3 supplier. So that's what we're going to do."

In terms of logistics, we'll see, it is true for the -- I mean the problem exists for the industry, and it's not practical for me to ship batteries, air ship batteries. That's not going to happen because the cost of air shipping batteries will not make sense no matter whatever way you cut it. I can ship a microinverter by paying a little bit of money, but that is not true for batteries. It's too much of money and it won't be economically sensible.
So what I think is within -- be optimistic means within 8 to 10 weeks, I should have all of this problem resolved, I should be able to get back to my capacity of 120-megawatt hours per quarter. And from then onwards, look for a third supplier to increase that capacity."

And because of that, IQ 7+ is usually used for higher-end modules. Higher-end modules may be around 340, 350 watts. You start using IQ 7+ so you don't compromise on what is called the DC/AC ratio. Historically, we haven't broken out the mix between 7 and 7+. We are not going to do it even now. But we are definitely seeing a trend towards the higher power. And that's not a surprising trend in the industry. That's what the industry does. So the power and the DC module keeps going up. Therefore, the microinverters have to go up. So IQ 7+ is here to stay, is here to ramp. And in terms of the pricing, the way we do pricing is in terms of dollar per watt. And so if you provide increased wattage, meaning if I provide increased wattage, the price of that microinverter is automatically higher.
In addition, in other things that are also contributing to pricing in addition to just wattage, it's quality, et cetera, customer experience matters, too. They're all variables in pricing. But IQ 7+ is definitely more. And -- but coming to the reverse side of the equation is IQ 7+ requires us to make some small tweaks compared to the IQ 7 microinverter in terms of hardware. So the transformer may be a little bit different. Some of the transistors, input transistors may be a little different. So the cost is not the same of the microinverter.
However, again, like what I said, we price products and value and make sure our corporate gross margin is always met. And we obviously like higher-powered products because they give us a little bit extra margin compared to lower power, as you can imagine.

Australia could be different because they usually have a little bit more, meaning the power grid in Australia may not be as stable as Germany. So they will use backup more than Germany. So that will be a little bit different. And they're all different grid voltages in frequency. So we learned there for some time. And by that time, all our manufacturing issues will be resolved."

But we are not willing to pay sometimes the prices as well there, especially over the last few quarters. Now there is a little bit of a more -- the market is opening a little bit better, some of these facts and pulling back, pricing appears to be more palatable in the way we are doing the analysis in terms of IRR, payback and so on and all these acquisitions.
We -- as a communication record here, I mean, we are very diligent on making sure that all the acquisitions that we do meet a high bar of a payback IRR in all of those things that are very important to us. So when we think about capital allocation, the amount that we have reserved for M&A is very important. So that's something important to us to convey and which we'll be opening over the next few quarters.
In terms of the $500 million over 3-year share buyback program that the Board approved. I think this phenomenal, right, because it allows us to redeploy that capital into share buybacks. As the opportunity comes with the volatility on the stock throughout that period. So meaning we are not using that one more than strategically positioning the company to rebuy the shares, for example, that we issue as part of the converts.
In this case, we have 4 million shares issued. We bought $1.7 million of our shares back at a very reasonably low price. So that kind of gives you a sense of what we are thinking in terms of the utilization of that approval by the Board of $500 million over 3 years.
And finally, we know how to run the company with very little cash. So my cash -- floating cash that I need on the balance sheet to run the company has been about between $300 million, $400 million. So that tells you that as we continue generating cash, we're going to replenish that over the years, right? So that's kind of the program that we have in a lot of M&A inside the opportunistic share buyback on the $500 million approved by the Board over 3 years. and quite a bit of internal growth.
That's why we commented on the OpEx as well, right? As we see going forward, sometimes we decide to build the capability in-house. That means hiring more people, increasing our OpEx, but we're still committed to be comfortably above the 20% operating income for the company as a whole. So hopefully, that answered long, but detailed answer give you a sense of how we are managing cash."

At the end of the day, if I can reduce the payback period for the homeowner, I will, along with our installers. So if we do that by offsetting meaning the homeowners can help the utilities for many times during the summer and a few times during the winter, they get paid for it.
For example, the connected solutions program is a lucrative program with a 10-kilowatt hour Enphase Encharge battery you can get up to $1,500 a year in Rhode Island, and you can get up to $1,000 a year in Massachusetts, extremely lucrative program. Of course, the dollars, et cetera, since these are still in pilot stage, dollars, et cetera, are questionable, might come down when they are in full ramp or when thousands such programs are there amongst the United States, but it is starting. It is starting. It is going to help us sell solar plus storage and we are solving a real problem for the utility. So the utilities are going to be participating in with us.

So which is why I don't think it's the right time to talk about revenue. But we are going to understand this market a lot more in the next a few quarters.
And coming back to the connected solutions, where do we differentiate? Because our differentiation is we make it so easy for a homeowner to go to his app and he can pick grid services, and he can enroll on the grid services program easily with a touch of a button. And once he is enrolled, he can actually monitor how much he's saving, he can basically opt out of the event. Like, for example, if you have an event tomorrow where the utility wants your battery to discharge, you can opt out today. That option is also through the app. You can set your reserve in the battery. Normally, the utility will set it will recommend 10% in order to give you the full grid services benefit. But you can adjust that in the app, too. So the app makes it seamless. And of course, that's where we come in. We want to make sure we take care of the homeowner and our installers and our partners. They are -- and we want to provide an exceptional experience for the home."

Softdesk is a software company that makes design and proposal software for installers and licenses to them. The license fee, in general, is well understood by the industry. and you can do some work on it. We also said that we have 850 installers right now utilizing that platform. So that will give you a rough idea of the contribution.
And the more important thing we are excited about are is both these companies, the software company and the permitting services, which I will talk about next. Both of them achieved the record revenues. This is the highest revenue. And why? Because Enphase today sells our products, microinverters and storage to a lot of long tail installers. Our installer count is, meaning installers we have served. Out of the 5,000 long tail installers in the U.S., we probably interact with at least 1,500 of them. And so it's a huge opportunity understanding the overlap between the installers who utilize the solar graph in our tool and understanding the overlap on who actually buys the products.
So therefore, there is enormous scope for us to introduce our long tail installers of white products, to solar graft platform. And that's what we are going to do. We are going to make that platform a lot better, investing a lot more there. We are going to have sharing. We are going to have storage and we are going to make that a best-in-class software tool. That's on the Softdesk. That's the acquisition based in Montreal that we completed early in the year.
The next one is even more interesting. This is the permitting services company that we closed the acquisition in April. That company does permitting services for a significant fraction of the North American business, the North American solar business. And there again, so far, the permitting services has been restricted to a few big customers simply because it is -- today, although we provide a service, it's a 24-hour service. And we think there can be a lot of efficiency that can be taken out by automating that permitting service to make it almost like a self-service. It takes a couple of hours versus 24 hours. So again, the name of the game there is to take that installer count from a handful today, which is mainly big installers to 1,000-plus installers that we have. Once again, that's what we are going to do by automation.
So -- and I gave you some color. And -- but the short story is both businesses are exceeding their targets that were promised to us before. They both have good leadership, and we are thinking of interesting ways the 2 companies can work together. And I think the name of the game is to introduce both services to our installers."

In general, I want to make a comment about grid services. But if you look ahead, it will be a requirement. I mean you need coordination amongst all of the systems that are deployed because as you think about the world evolving into a world of EV, et cetera, and home electrification, this coordination will become more and more important. So having a system that's extremely intelligent that's behind the meter that is coupled to a very intelligent platform that's in the cloud is critical. And that's a big competitive advantage for us because we have built that system. We have architected that system from the bottoms up that allows very simple and effective communication and control from the cloud to all of these DERs that are deployed behind the meter."

So where we come in is we can provide any kind of solution.
For the loan market, what we can do where the homeowner actually owns the asset, the homeowner owns the battery. When the homeowner owns the battery and he sees significant savings, his decision on buying the battery is easy. And whether it's loan, whether it's lease, we are going to be there. It is our platform. And we are going to make it so easy for the homeowner to save money. And our app gives unprecedented visibility. So we'll service everybody."

For the auto guys, they will go back and forth between LFP and other chemistries because LFP comes with more weight. More weight is okay for ESS, which is the stationary storage. More weight is questionable. Although they -- some of them are moving, more weight is questionable. For EVs, and I'm sure innovation is going to happen on that front.
So -- but for us, we made the right decision before. I think we are happy that other people are moving to it. We have good partners. We are going to get a few more good partners to increase our capacity and our strategy is unchanged there."

We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $316.1 million, shipped approximately 2.36 million microinverters and 43-megawatt hours of Enphase storage",2048,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $316.1 million, shipped approximately 2.36 million microinverters and 43-megawatt hours of Enphase storage systems, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8%, and generated strong free cash flow of $49.2 million. 
We exited the second quarter at approximately 41%, 16%, 24%. This means 41% gross margin, 16% operating expenses and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. Eric will go into details about our finances later in the call. 
Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q2 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 67% compared to 63% in Q1. And our North American Net Promoter Score was 71% compared to 69% in Q1. Our average call wait time decreased to approximately 3 minutes in Q2 from more than 5 minutes in Q1. Our 24/7 global customer support helped to reduce the wait times.
In addition, we are building field service teams in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers. We also expect to add a team in Australia during Q4. We remain laser focused on customer service and making sure that we are the easiest company to do business with.
Let's now talk about manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past earnings calls, the demand for our microinverter systems continues to be well ahead of supply. In Q2, we experienced component constraints on the supply of AC FET drivers, which resulted in our microinverter shipment volume slightly lower as compared to Q1. We had 3 AC FET driver suppliers qualified by the end of the second quarter compared to 2 in the first quarter.
For the third quarter, we continue to expect to remain constrained on microinverters. But the supply situation is better than what it was in the second quarter. We expect to have 4 suppliers qualified by the end of the third quarter. Regarding the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the situation will be significantly better compared to the third quarter. 
On the ASIC used in our microinverters, we have sufficient supply. So that has not been a big constraint so far. As previously discussed, we are expanding our microinverter manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India. At our facility in India, we installed a second fully automated line in Q2, with production beginning at the end of the quarter. This brings our quarterly capacity to 1.5 million microinverters from India. 
In Mexico, we expect to add a fully automated manufacturing line in Q4. This will bring quarterly capacity to approximately 2.2 million microinverters in Mexico. With our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2021.
Let's talk about batteries. We have 2 sources for battery cell packs with a total capacity of 120-megawatt hours per quarter. I previously mentioned, we are going to add a third source in 2022 to increase our overall capacity. Talking about our lead times, our lead times for storage systems are a little high today between 12 and 14 weeks and we are working on streamlining our engineering and manufacturing to bring them down below 10 weeks by the end of 2021.
Let's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 81% and 19%, respectively. The U.S. market demand was very strong in Q2, but we were supply constrained. Therefore, revenue was only up 3% sequentially. Our teams work hard to ensure customers that continuous supply of product. The sell-through from our distribution partners to installers remained very strong, keeping channel inventory tight, but at manageable levels. Our teams ensured that all customers had product that they needed to complete jobs and were not forced to seek automators. Although, the constrained supply prevented customers from building buffer inventory. 
In Europe, we reported record revenue in Q2. The revenue increased 16% sequentially. The channel inventory was much tighter in Europe than the U.S., but we expect it to improve in Q3 and Q4. We had solid growth in Netherlands, France and Germany, and continued strong microinverter sales to Maxeon for its ACM product during the second quarter. 
We also began selling our Enphase storage systems in Germany during late Q2, representing the products' first international expansion outside the U.S. We launched our solar plus storage system estimator sizing tool in Germany that showcases panel placement on the roof, along with storage sizing and a comprehensive financial analysis. 
Germany represents the largest residential storage market in Europe with high attach rates. The market response to the introduction of the Enphase storage system in Germany has been positive, and we expect this to also drive the microinverter business in the country. Overall, I'm very pleased with our growth in Europe. 
In the Asia Pacific region, revenue declined 3% sequentially in Q2, primarily due to COVID disruptions in Australia, along with normal seasonality. Despite these headwinds, we are quite happy with microinverter sales during the second quarter from the continued adoption of our highest power IQ 7A product and our AC module partnerships. We expect to pilot Enphase storage systems in Australia in the fourth quarter. 
In Latin America, Q2 revenue was up 38% sequentially, largely due to increased sales of both Enphase Solar and Storage Systems in Puerto Rico. As I discussed last quarter, we are expanding into Brazil. We have hired a team there to enter the Brazilian market, and we expect first revenue from this region in Q3. 
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q3. Our overall customer demand for Q3 once again significantly exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. We continue to remain supply constrained in Q3. Our component availability is improving in Q3 compared to Q2, but not at the rate of growth in demand.
Let's now move to our storage systems rollout. We shipped 43-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the second quarter. During the quarter, we released load control, a new feature that provides Enphase Storage Systems with the capability to automatically shed nonessential loads during an outage. With load control, homeowners have the option to conserve their energy consumption and extend their backup duration simply via a onetime setting of the Enlighten app.
Let's now turn to training for our Enphase storage systems. By the end of Q2, we trained 2,592 installers cumulatively, representing more than 1,500 unique installation companies. This represents a significant jump compared to Q1 as we were able to resume some in-person training in Q2. 
We also continue to make steady progress on the commissioning of our Enphase Storage Systems and made numerous updates to our software app. Our goal remains a sub-60-minute commissioning time, which will allow installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage System in less than a few hours. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on that front. 
The introduction of load control in late May, along with some pricing adjustments we did for our installers, plus the improvements in the commissioning process has resulted in an acceleration of demand for Enphase storage since June. As a result, we expect to ship between 60 and 70-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the third quarter. We are already fully booked for Q3 on storage. And our current lead times, as I said before, are 12 to 14 weeks. We are working hard to bring the lead times down to under 10 weeks. 
Let's talk about our new products, specifically the IQ 8 microinverter and the IQ 8D microinverter product launches. IQ 8 is the world's first grid independent microinverter for residential solar. And IQ 8 is the high-powered 640-watt AC microinverter, capable of supporting 2 panels for small commercial solar. We are making good progress in the compliance, reliability and system testing of these products. We expect first shipments of the IQ 8 PV microinverters in Q3, and first shipments of the IQ 8D product in Q4. Given our component supply challenges, we are going to ramp these products quite cautiously. 
On the last earnings call, we discussed the generator compatibility feature for our Enphase Storage Systems last quarter. We are a little bit behind here as we took more time to complete the system testing. We are currently piloting generator compatibility with a handful of real homes and are seeing great results. We expect to introduce this feature introduction by the end of the third quarter. Homeowners will then have the ability to add generators to their Enphase Storage Systems, and will be able to configure the generator behavior from the Enphase app. 
The Enphase Home Energy Management System provides a seamless transition from on-grid to off-grid, ensuring a superior installer and homeowner experience. This generator functionality, as I said, will be integrated into our mobile app so the homeowners have full visibility and control from one app. 
Let's now turn to digital transformation. Both our recent acquisitions, Sofdesk and the Solar business of DIN Engineering are fully integrated and exceeded our expectations with record revenue and installer accounts in Q2. The 850-plus installers using the Solargraf software tool will soon have access to new features such as shading and storage system sizing. 
Our permitting services are also undergoing significant improvements towards automation to drive mass adoption amongst the long tail of installers. Our digital transformation initiatives focused on reducing staff costs, while improving profitability and efficiency for our installers, resulting in clean and affordable energy for all. 
Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded 500 installers in North America, 146 installers in Australia and 169 installers in Europe to our Enphase Installer Network through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. 
We also introduced EIN networks in India and Mexico during the second quarter. This has been a highly successful initiative as we are adding trusted installers who will act as product evangelists on our behalf and are expected to provide an exceptional experience to homeowners. 
Let's talk about our entry into grid services for the first time. We have started participating in the ConnectedSolutions program, which is an incentive program implemented by 2 utilities in the Northeast region of the United States to reduce electrical demand during the high-use periods. Enphase storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island can sign up, monitor, track money earned and control participation in the program using our Enlighten mobile app. 
These grid services programs enable utilities to leverage Enphase Storage Systems instead of turning on polluting bigger plants while generating an income stream for the battery owner. Enphase customers participating in the ConnectedSolutions program can receive up to $1,500 a year for our 10-kilowatt hour battery once they share the battery when they -- when called upon by the utility. 
Facilitating grid services participation for our customers will reduce the lifetime cost of Enphase storage systems and help drive increased demand. We plan to participate in more such programs in the future. 
Enphase is laser focused on building best-in-class home energy management systems and delivering them to homeowners through our digital platform, along with our Enphase Installer Network and distribution partners. We now have solar, storage, load control, grid services and generator compatibility as part of our home energy management system. We plan on adding other distributed energy resources down the line. 
Our digital platform captures both installer and homeowner journeys, providing tools and services such as design, proposal and permitting, with the goal of reducing soft costs and accelerating the adoption of clean energy. 
In summary, we are very happy with the performance in the first half of 2021 and the ongoing strong demand for our solar and storage products. We look forward to the ramping of our storage systems, introducing new products, accelerating digital transformation and enhancing customer experience. We plan to host an Analyst Day in the fourth quarter and will provide more details on our next quarter's earnings call. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Total revenue for Q2 was $316.1 million, representing an increase of 5% sequentially. We shipped approximately 796 megawatts DC of microinverters and 43-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the quarter. Microinverter unit shipments declined slightly relative to Q1, but favorable product mix led to the sequential revenue growth. 
Non-GAAP gross margins for Q2 was 40.8% compared to 41.1% for Q1. The decrease was primarily as a result of higher logistics and expedite costs, partially offset by disciplined pricing and favorable mix. GAAP gross margin was 40.4% for Q2.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $51.7 million for Q2 compared to $43.7 million for Q1. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investment in R&D and sales and marketing programs and increased hiring. In addition, Q2 was the first full quarter of consolidation of the recent acquisitions of Sofdesk and DIN. 
GAAP operating expenses were $68.4 million for Q2 compared to $61.6 million for Q1 GAAP operating expenses for Q2, including $14.3 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $2.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was $77.2 million for Q2 compared to $80.2 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $59.4 million for Q2 compared to $61.4 million for Q1. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $74.7 million compared to $78.7 million for Q1. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.53 for Q2 compared to $0.56 per share for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $39.4 million compared to GAAP net income of $31.7 million for Q1. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.28 for Q2 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.22 for Q1. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $37.8 million at the end of Q2 compared to $34.9 million at the end of Q1. The sequential increase was driven by higher battery cell pack inventory to support the expected growth of Enphase Energy Storage System shipment. Days of inventory outstanding was unchanged compared to Q1 and stood at 18 days, reflecting the current supply-constrained environment as well as longer lead times. 
Accounts receivable were $281.2 million at the end of Q2 compared to $236.1 million at the end of Q1. The sequential increase was due to the higher revenue in Q2 and shipments being weighted to the second half of the quarter. DSO of 65 days increased from 56 days in the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments. 
We exited Q2 with a total cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion compared to approximately $1.5 billion for Q1. We fully utilized our $200 million share repurchase authorization and bought approximately 1.7 million shares at an average share price of approximately $117 in Q2. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million over the next 3 years. 
In Q2, we generated $65.6 million in cash flow from operations and $49.2 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $16.4 million for Q2 to expand microinverter manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India as well for costs related to Enlighten software app development, corporate website development, and investment in IT and cloud infrastructure.
Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We expect our revenues for the quarter to be within a range of $335 million to $355 million, which includes shipments of 60- to 70-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems. We expect the GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40%, and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. 
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $105 million to $108 million, including a total of approximately $46.4 million, estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and $1.6 million, estimated for acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $57 million to $60 million.
Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. As Badri mentioned earlier, we will be constrained by component availability in Q3. The revenue guidance assumes a modest increase in microinverter shipments, but the primary driver of growth will come from increased storage systems. We expect to ship 60- to 70-megawatt hours of our Enphase Storage Systems in Q3, representing approximately 50% sequential growth at the midpoint. We expect improved component availability for microinverter production in Q4 and continued momentum for the Enphase Storage Systems.
On the cost side, we are continuing to expedite components and finished goods in Q3 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. To put in the magnitude of expedite cost into perspective, the expense in Q2 was larger than for all of 2020. We expect the quarterly expedited expenses to remain at similar levels for the remainder of 2021. Due to the elevated logistics costs and increase in some component costs, we implemented a modest price increase for microinverters starting in Q3. 
Next, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase in Q3. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we will still expect to be comfortably above our baseline financial model target of 20% operating income. 
As we accelerate towards our vision of providing best-in-class home energy management systems, we are investing significantly in R&D, particularly in areas that further our competitive advantage such as ASIC and so forth. Semiconductor integration and cloud software are core differentiation that increase our system performance, reduce cost and increase reliability. 
We are also ramping up our marketing expense in the back half of the year to increase homeowner awareness of our solutions. For Q3 accruals for post-combination expenses from prior acquisitions are expected to be approximately $3.4 million. 
Finally, I will touch on the increase of the stock-based compensation expense in Q3. The sequential increase is due to the higher number of employees globally as we continue to accelerate our growth plans as well as the need to retain top-level employees as an S&P 500 company.
With that, I will now open the lines for questions."

Critical component is what is called as an AC FET driver. This is made by a few semiconductor suppliers. And in the first quarter of this year, we had 2 such suppliers qualified. The market -- the semiconductor supply chain today is immense, and so we worked hard. We qualified a third supplier in the second quarter. We were living hand to mouth in the second quarter, and you saw the results. 
The situation is getting better day by day. So in the third quarter, I expect to do more number of microinverters, I expect to qualify one more supplier. Still, the semiconductor supply chain is stressed, though, which is why I cannot meet all my demand. In the fourth quarter, I see better visibility right now. But look, I predicted that in the first quarter, we are going to be out of the woods soon, that was not the case. 
So I remain cautiously optimistic that the situation is going to get better. And we can meet most of our demand, it may be difficult to meet all of our demand right now because with IQ 8 ramp, I can never say what's going to happen. We are rapidly getting ready. It's too early for me to talk about the third quarter, but I'm getting ready in terms of manufacturing capacity. 
I want to exit the fourth quarter at, at least 5 million units of manufacturing capacity, not demand. And we'll continue to work on the suppliers on qualifying additional -- I may qualify one more supplier if I need to. But at this point, visibility is better than what I told you the last time. However, I still remain cautiously optimistic about Q4."

We had a very clear idea on our value proposition, and that has largely not changed. It has only gotten better. Our value proposition is all-in-one solar plus storage solution. We do not deal with high voltages even for DC batteries. We only deal with low-voltage DC. 
Our battery solution, 3.3 kilowatt hour is a modular solution, creating a lot of flexibility for our installers. Our chemistry is a lithium ion phosphate chemistry that is excellent in fire safety. In addition, we focused on power when you start air conditioners, you do need a soft start-up, but with our feature called Power Start, we are able to provide extra power for that surge when the air conditioners turn on. 
Those value propositions have largely remained intact. Then you asked about market feedback. Our customers gave us a lot of feedback. Our initial commissioning times we're not that good. They were -- the commissioning times were of the order of several hours and customers did not like that. Installers did not like that. They gave us a lot of feedback. We took all of that feedback into perspective, and we improved our commissioning process a lot. 
We have learned a lot in the last year. Home owners also gave us valuable feedback in terms of in terms of micro grid failures like, for example, how do we provide the right notification to the homeowners, so that they know that, okay, now I am in off-grid more, in an outage mode, and I need to take extra steps to conserve my battery life. 
So we learned a lot from homeowners. We updated our software multiple, multiple times during the last year. And recently, in May, we introduced load control. Load control was extremely important because for the people who have, let's say, a lot of air conditioners, they don't want to screw around with doing a partial home backup. You can do a whole home backup and you can leave out the air conditioners by default. You can shed the loads automatically. So we provide now as of late May, we introduced 4 circuit load control. So heavy loads can be automatically shared through a onetime app setting. 
Now you heard me talking about generator compatibility. We -- pretty soon by the end of -- by the end of the quarter, we will be introducing, again, through software, our home energy management system will incorporate generators to plug into them, giving homeowners unprecedented visibility and control from one app. 
Additional things with it. We introduced 24/7 customer support. We have -- we now have a field service team which will help the installers -- with the installers find it invaluable. We have roundtables, weekly roundtables. I personally meet with 10 to 15 installers every week, get their feedback and make continuous corrections to the product. 
Now let's talk about pricing. The introduction in the last 1 year was by design. I wouldn't have changed much. We learned a lot. Our costs initially were high as typical in a ramp. Our pricing was therefore a little bit high. And now I have learned a lot from the field, we have improved the commissioning process, and we introduced load control. 
So we felt it was the time to make the right pricing adjustment while being very disciplined and doing value-based pricing. So we did exactly that in late May, along with load control, along with the latest commissioning improvements, we even introduced 15-year extra -- 15-year warranty plan. We felt it was the right time to make a pricing adjustment, which we did. 
And we have seen since June enormous acceleration in storage demand, which is why we are guiding 50% from Q2 shipments. Q3 guidance, midpoint of guidance will be up 50% from Q2 shipments. 
Now we've got to do one thing. We need to improve our lead times on batteries. When I mean 12 to 14 weeks, if somebody orders the battery today from me, they can only get the battery in 12 to 14 weeks, which is not acceptable. I need to go work on streamlining both engineering, manufacturing cycle time in order to push that down to under 10 weeks, ideally 8 weeks. 
So that's something that I have to do. And I do need to get a third supplier because I see that -- I see us doing well. And I've become more optimistic on batteries. We do need a 3 supplier. So that's what we're going to do."

In terms of logistics, we'll see, it is true for the -- I mean the problem exists for the industry, and it's not practical for me to ship batteries, air ship batteries. That's not going to happen because the cost of air shipping batteries will not make sense no matter whatever way you cut it. I can have shipped a microinverter by paying a little bit of money, but that is not true for batteries. It's too much of money and it won't be economically sensible. 
So what I think is within -- be optimistic guiding means stays within 8 to 10 weeks, I should have all of this problem resolved, I should be able to get back to my capacity of 120-megawatt hours per quarter. And from then onwards, look for a third supplier to increase that capacity."

And because of that, IQ 7+ is usually used for higher-end modules. And our higher-end modules may be around 340, 350 watts. You start using IQ 7+ so you don't compromise on what is called the DC/AC ratio. 
Historically, we haven't broken out the mix between 7 and 7+. We are not going to do it even now. But we are definitely seeing a trend towards the higher power. And that's not a surprising trend in the industry. That's what the industry does. So the power and the DC module keeps going up. Therefore, the microinverters have to go up. 
So IQ 7+ is here to stay, is here to ramp. And in terms of the pricing, the way we do pricing is in terms of dollar per watt. And so if you provide increased wattage, meaning if I provide increased wattage, the price of that microinverter is automatically higher. 
In addition, in other things that are also contributing to pricing in addition to just wattage, it's quality, et cetera, customer experience matters, too. They're all variables in pricing. But IQ 7+ is definitely more. And -- but coming to the reverse side of the equation is IQ 7+ requires us to make some small tweaks compared to the IQ 7 microinverter in terms of hardware. So the transformer may be a little bit different. Some of the transistors, input transistors may be a little different. So the cost is not the same of the microinverter. 
However, again, like what I said, we price products and value and make sure our corporate gross margin is always met. And we obviously like higher-powered products because they give us a little bit extra margin compared to lower power, as you can imagine. So long answer -- go ahead."

But we are not willing to pay sometimes the prices as well there, especially over the last few quarters. Now there is a little bit of a more -- the market is opening a little bit better, some of these facts and pulling back, pricing appears to be more palatable in the way we are doing the analysis in terms of IRR, payback and so on and all these acquisitions.
We -- as a communication record here, I mean, we are very diligent on making sure that all the acquisitions that we do meet a high bar of payback, IRR, in all of those things that are very important to us. So when we think about capital allocation, the amount that we have reserved for M&A is pretty important. So that's something important to us to convey and which we'll be opening over the next few quarters.
In terms of the $500 million over 3-year share buyback program that the Board approved, I think this is phenomenal, right, because it allows us to redeploy that capital into share buybacks. As the opportunity comes with the volatility on the stock throughout that period. So meaning we are not using that one more than strategically positioning the company to rebuy the shares, for example, that we issue as part of the converts.
In this case, we have 4 million shares issued. We bought 1.7 million of our shares back at a very reasonably low price. So that kind of gives you a sense of how we are thinking in terms of the utilization of that approval by the Board of $500 million over 3 years.
And finally, we know how to run the company with very little cash. So my cash -- the floating cash that I need on the balance sheet to run the company has been about between $300 million, $400 million. So that tells you that as we continue generating cash, we're going to replenish that over the years, right? So that's kind of the program that we have in a lot of M&A inside the opportunistic share buyback on the $500 million approved by the Board over 3 years and quite a bit of internal growth.
That's why we commented on the OpEx as well, right? As we see going forward, sometimes we decide to build the capability in-house. That means hiring more people, increasing our OpEx, but we're still committed to be comfortably above the 20% operating income for the company as a whole. So hopefully, that answered long, but detailed answer give you a sense of how we are managing cash."

And coming back to the ConnectedSolutions, where do we differentiate? Because our differentiation is we make it so easy for a homeowner to go to his app and he can pick grid services, and he can enroll on the grid services program easily with a touch of a button. And once he is enrolled, he can actually monitor how much he's saving, he can basically opt out of the event. 
Like, for example, if you have an event tomorrow where the utility wants your battery to discharge, you can opt out today. That option is also through the app. You can set your reserve in the battery. Normally, the utility will set -- will recommend 10% in order to give you the full grid services benefit. But you can adjust that in the app, too. 
So the app makes it seamless. And of course, that's where we come in. We want to make sure we take care of the homeowner and our installers and our partners. They are -- and we want to provide an exceptional experience for the homeowner."

Sofdesk is a software company that makes design and proposal software for installers and licenses it to them. The license fee, in general, is well understood by the industry. and you can do some work on it. We also said that we have 850 installers right now utilizing that platform. So that will give you a rough idea of the contribution.
And the more important thing we are excited about there is both these companies, the software company and the permitting services, which I will talk about next. Both of them achieved record revenues. This is the highest revenue. And why? Because Enphase today sells our products, microinverters and storage to a lot of long tail installers. Our installer count is, meaning installers we have served, out of the 5,000 long tail installers in the U.S., we probably interact with at least 1,500 of them. And so it's a huge opportunity on understanding the overlap between the installers who utilize the Solargraf in our tool and understanding the overlap on who actually buys the products.
So therefore, there is enormous scope for us to introduce our long tail installers of white products, to the Solargraf platform. And that's what we are going to do. We are going to make that platform a lot better, investing a lot more there. We are going to have sharing. We are going to have storage and we are going to make that a best-in-class software tool. That's on the Sofdesk. That's the acquisition based in Montreal that we completed early in the year.
The next one is even more interesting. This is the permitting services company that we closed the acquisition in April. That company does permitting services for a significant fraction of the North American business, the North American solar business. And there again, so far, the permitting services has been restricted to a few big customers simply because it is -- today, although we provide a service, it's a 24-hour service. 
And we think there can be a lot of efficiency that can be taken out by automating that permitting service to make it almost like a self-service. It takes a couple of hours versus 24 hours. So again, the name of the game there is to take that installer count from a handful today, which is mainly big installers to1,000-plus installers that we have. Once again, that's what we are going to do by automation.
So -- and I gave you some color. And -- but the short story is both businesses are exceeding their targets that were promised to us before. They both have good leadership, and we are thinking of interesting ways the 2 companies can work together. And I think the name of the game is to introduce both services to our installers."

And then maybe just on the -- just going back to one of the questions on the competition in the microinverter space. Could you maybe talk about like if it would make sense to use IQ 8D kind of a product for the residential market? Because that seems to like be the MO for a couple of your competitors to offer 2 for 1 or 4 for 1 in the residential space. 
So do you expect any those applications for the IQ 8D in residential? Or do you think a 1 for 1 makes more sense from a technical point of view or from a customer point of view?"

It's difficult. However, there are some regions where -- and some businesses like the commercial business that don't have the same stringent requirements. 
And so for those businesses, it may be economical to use a 2 panel, 1 microinverter IQ 8D product. And we'll be looking at that hard. It's not an easy question for us to answer. We'll be looking at that hard, but we are never going to deviate from our core product being like enough. Like when we go to IQ 9, when we go to IQ 10, we want to make that single microinverter a lot better.
That is the core for us. We are going to be making that a lot better. But in markets like Australia, for example, where our market share, we want to improve our market share, we may try some experiments. We may. But they will be done methodically and without deviating from our core platform."

In general, I want to make a comment about grid services. But if you look ahead, it will be a requirement. I mean you need coordination amongst all of the systems that are deployed because as you think about the world evolving into a world of EV, et cetera, and home electrification, this coordination will become more and more important. 
So having a system that's extremely intelligent that's behind the meter that is coupled to a very intelligent platform that's in the cloud is critical.

For the auto guys, they will go back and forth between LFP and other chemistries because LFP comes with more weight. More weight is okay for ESS, which is the stationary storage. More weight is questionable. Although they -- some of them are moving, more weight is questionable. For EVs, and I'm sure innovation is going to happen on that front.
So -- but for us, we made the right decision before. I think we are happy that other people are moving to it. We have good partners. We are going to get a few more good partners to increase our capacity and our strategy is unchanged there."

We had a good quarter. We reported record revenue of $351.5 million, shipped approximately 2.6 million microinverters and 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8% and generated strong free cash flow of $100.7 million. We exited the third quarter at approximately 41, 16, 24. This means 41% gross margin, 16% operating expenses and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. 
As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. Our CFO, Eric, will go into detail about our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q3 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 67%, and our North American Net Promoter Score was 71%, both unchanged from Q2. Our average call wait time went up a little bit and was at 5.5 minutes in Q3 compared to 3 minutes in Q2, primarily related to the growth in our business. We are working on reducing call wait times to under a minute through additional staffing and training. We have increased the number of field service teams in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers, particularly for storage. We remain laser focused on customer experience. 
Let's talk about manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past earnings call, the global supply chain is under stress. Our situation is getting primarily better due to our hard work in qualifying alternate suppliers. For the AC FET drivers, we now have 5 suppliers qualified. Our supply of AC FET drivers is much better in Q4 than the prior quarters. For the AC microinverters, we are a little bit tight on supply, but we expect to manage the situation. While we are happy with the overall supply for Q4, the situation is quite dynamic worldwide for both supply chain as well as logistics. We remain vigilant and given the growing demand. So given our strong demand, we are adding a fully automated line in Mexico in Q4, bringing our quarterly capacity in Mexico to approximately 2.2 million microinverters. We have already added a second fully automated line in Q2 at our contract manufacturing partner in India, bringing that quarterly capacity to over 1.5 million microinverters in India. 
Along with our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target global capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of the year. We have now geographically diversified 2/3 of our contract manufacturing capacity outside of China. Let's now talk about batteries. Our 2 sources for battery cell packs have increased their capacity to a total of approximately 180-megawatt hours per quarter from 120. Our existing suppliers are capable of adding more capacity required. In the meantime, we are working on adding additional suppliers in 2022 to achieve global diversification. Our lead times for Storage Systems are long to date at approximately 14 weeks due to the global logistics challenges. 
These lead times will come down once the shipping constraints and port congestion improve. Despite these headwinds, we expect to increase shipments of our Enphase Storage Systems by approximately 45% sequentially in Q4. Let's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 76% and 24%, respectively. The U.S. market demand was quite strong in Q3, and we reported record revenue. We had record sell-through from our distribution partners to installers for both microinverters and storage. While our microinverter channel inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q3, our storage channel inventory remained tight due to strong demand and logistics issues. We expect microinverter channel inventory to remain manageable in Q4 and expect storage channel inventory to get better. 
In Europe, we reported record revenue in Q3. We continue to have solid growth in Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain. Our Storage business in Germany is just getting started, and we are continuing to train a lot of installers. In September, we announced our entry into Italy, where we are providing IQ 7 family of microinverters to residential installers. Earlier this month, in October, we began selling Enphase Storage Systems to customers in Belgium, further expanding the products availability in Europe. Overall, I'm very pleased with our growth in Europe. 
In Asia Pacific region, revenue declined a little bit in Q3, primarily due to ongoing COVID lockdowns in Australia. Despite the disruptions, we are pleased with the growth of the Enphase Installer Network, the continued adoption of our high power IQ 7A product and growing strength of our AC module partnerships. In Latin America, we reported record revenue in Q3, largely due to the increased sales of Solar and Storage Systems in Puerto Rico. We are quite optimistic about our business in Puerto Rico and expect steady growth in the next few quarters, especially in Storage. We also announced our entry into Brazil in September and started shipping IQ 7+ microinverters to installers in early October. 
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q4. Our overall customer demand for Q4 once again exceeds the higher end of our guidance. The component availability is currently much better in Q4 compared to Q3, but not fully there yet. We are optimistic that our supply will catch up the demand by early next year. Let's now move to an update on our Storage Systems. We shipped 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in Q3, which was a 51% increase from Q2. Let's discuss the training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q3, we had trained 3,771 installer personnel, representing approximately 1,700 unique installation companies. Our hands-on storage installation training through our mobile vans and training centers also started ramping in Q3 with electricians and lead installers attending training sessions and experiencing valuable hands-on time with systems. 
We are working diligently on our Enphase Storage Systems to improve commissioning times for installers. With the rapid increase in the number of long-tail installers, our average commissioning time is approximately 2.5 hours in Q3. We are working hard to bring this time down and made numerous updates in Q3. Our goal remains a sub-60-minute commissioning time, which will allow installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage Systems in less than a few hours. We've recently introduced 2 new features for our Enphase Storage Systems. In late May, we introduced Load Control, which provides homeowners the ability to conserve their energy consumption by shedding nonessential loads during an outage, and thereby extending the backup duration. 
We have 4 circuits for Load Control designed into our smart switch. These loads will be on when the grid is present and shed automatically in the event of a grid failure. This feature is configurable and controllable by the homeowner via our Enphase app. Last week, we announced that our Home Energy Systems will soon integrate with most leading models of home standby AC generators, providing enhanced performance and a glitch-free transition for homeowners during power outages. Homeowners can monitor real-time the power flow, start and stop their generator remotely, set quite to prevent their generated from operating until their batteries fall below a certain state of charge and control it all with the Enphase app. 
This new feature functions without a dedicated generate automatic transfer switch, and eliminates the power glitches that research home appliances when switching to generator power. This new feature will be available to installers in the U.S. in November. With the addition of these new features, plus our laser focus on customer experience, we continue to see an acceleration in demand for our Enphase Storage Systems. As a result, we expect to ship between 90 and 100-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in Q4. Let's talk about new products. Yesterday, we announced the all-new all-in-one Enphase Energy system with IQ 8 solar microinverters for customers in North America. IQ 8 is Enphase's modest macro inverter Unlike competing devices, IQ 8 can form a micro grid during a power outage using sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery. 
Since the company's inception, we have invested in custom applications, specific integrated chips for our microinverters. And today, we see a big payoff with a software-defined microinverters, smart enough to form a micro grid. Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining even during a power outage. This is unfortunately not been true until today. Now with IQ 8, homeowners can realize the true promise of solar to make and use their own power. IQ 8 solar microinverters can provide sunlight backup during an outage even without a battery. The Enphase Energy system with IQ 8 comes in 4 different configurations. The first is solar only, which is a standard grid-tied system that everybody is used to today. 
The second is sunlight backup, which I just talked about, without a battery. The third is very interesting. It's home essentials backup with a small battery for cover and nighttime backup. The fourth is full energy independent. A solar system with IQ 8 and a large battery. So while the first configuration, as I mentioned, is a standard system. The remaining 3 configurations are grid-agnostic system, which need an Enphase system controller or a smart switch which the home during an outage. For homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions impairing an Enphase battery with an IQ 8 solar system. All the configurations can be customized for homeowners with the help of our valued and phase installer partners. 
We started piloting IQ 8 to select installers in Q3, and we will be ramping shipments in Q4 beginning December. We expect the IQ 8 ramp to take 4 to 6 quarters much like the IQ 7 ramp. Let me also say a few words about IQ 8D. So IQ 8D is a high-power 640-watt AC microinverter capable of supporting 2 DC panels, primarily for the small commercial solar business. We expect to start piloting IQ 8D with select installers in Q4 and begin production shipments in Q1. This product is very important to us, not only for the small commercial solar business, but also for our next-generation batteries as we increase the discharge power and improve our cost structure. 
Let's turn to digital transformation. Both of our recent acquisitions achieved record revenue in Q3. Enphase which provides design and proposal software added a significant number of new installers. We plan to release several new software features early next year to improve the installer experience. Enphase which provides proposal and permitting services for installers also experienced a significant increase in customer demand and is focused on automating the creation of permit plan sets to further expand the installer base. Both teams will significantly leverage the Enphase Installer Network to grow and expand their business. Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. 
We have now onboarded approximately 1,000 installers to our Enphase Installer Network worldwide through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. Our EIN in the U.S. has grown 57% since its introduction last year. We are very pleased with this initiative progress and are thankful to installers who act as our product evangelists and provide an exceptional experience to homeowners. Let's talk about grid services. Last quarter, we discussed our participation in the Connected Solutions program, which is an incentive program implemented by 3 utilities in the Northeast U.S. to reduce electrical demand during high-use periods. 
Our storage customers in ConnectiCet, Massachusetts and Rhode Island can sign up, monitor, track and control participation in the program using the Enphase app. We were pleased to announce in Q3 our participation in the Hawaiian Electric Battery Bonus Grid Services program. This program offers a new incentive for homeowners on the island of who installed a new home battery. The first customers accepted by Hawaiian Electric into the program will be eligible to receive $850 per kilowatt that they commit to make available during a fixed 2-hour period each day. The program helps Electric realize the goal of 100% renewable power by 2045 and more homeowners than ever before can now have a solar plus storage system. 
We expect to engage with more such utilities and aggregators and our grid services program during the months ahead. In summary, we are pleased with the overall progress we have made this year. We now have solar storage, load control, grid services and generator compatibility as part of our home energy management system. We are making significant progress on the digital platform for installers in order to cut soft costs. We will remain laser focused on both the products and the digital platform to deliver a superior customer experience for both our installers and homeowners. 
I'd like to make one more important announcement. We will be hosting an Investor Day on November 16 to provide a deeper update on our business. More details will follow over the next few weeks. With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which will be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Total revenue for Q3 was $351.5 million, representing an increase of 11% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 913 megawatts DC of microinverters and 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 40.8%, the same as compared to Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin was impacted by higher logistics and expedited costs partially offset by a price increase on microinverters and continued cost management. GAAP gross margin was 39.9% for Q3. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $57.3 million for Q3 compared to $51.7 million for Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investments in R&D, IT infrastructure and brand awareness, marketing programs. 
GAAP operating expenses were $103 million for Q3 compared to $68.4 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $44 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $1.6 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring intangible assets. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $85.9 million compared to $77.2 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $37.4 million for Q3 compared to $59.4 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $84.2 million compared to $74.7 million for Q2. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.60 for Q3 compared to $0.53 per share for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $21.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $39.4 million for Q2. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.15 for Q3 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for Q2. Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $65.4 million at the end of Q3 compared to $37.8 million at the end of Q2. The sequential increase was due to the expected higher demand for solar and Storage Systems in Q4 as well as longer lead times due to current global logistics and supply chain challenges. Days of inventory outstanding was 28 days at the end of Q3 compared to 18 days at the end of Q2 to support the growth in demand. Our target is 30 days. 
Accounts receivable were $273 million at the end of Q3 compared to $281.2 million at the end of Q2. DSO of 54 days in Q3 decreased for 65 days in the prior quarter. We exited Q3 with a total cash and cash equivalent and market related securities balance of approximately $1.4 billion compared to approximately $1.3 billion at the end of Q2. We did not make any share repurchases against our recently approved $500 million share repurchase authorization. In Q3, we generated $113.4 million in cash flow from operations and $100.7 million on free cash flow. Capital expenditures was $12.7 million for Q3 to expand both, microinverters and storage manufacturing capacity as well as cost related to app development, website and IT. 
Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $390 million to $410 million, which includes shipments of 90 to 100-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expense. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $119 million to $122 million, including a total of approximately $52 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. 
We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $67 million to $70 million. Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. The revenue guidance assumes an increase in microinverter shipments, including IQ 8 as well as a Storage System shipment. We expect to ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in Q4, representing approximately 45% sequential growth at the midpoint of the guidance. We expect improved component availability for microinverter production in Q4 and continued momentum for the Enphase Storage Systems. 
On the cost side, we are continuing to expedite components and finished goods in Q4 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. We expect the quarterly expedited expenses to remain at similar levels at Q3. Due to the steep increase in logistic cost and increase in component costs driven by inflation, we are implementing a modest price increase on all products starting in the second half of Q4. It is also prudent for us to maintain our baseline financial model as we continue to navigate the global component supply constraints and logistics challenges. 
Finally, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase in Q4. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we still expect to be comfortably above our baseline target of 20% operating income. We continue to invest significantly in R&D to further our competitive advantage. Significantly, we are more focused on semiconductor integration of our ASIC and software advancement, including cloud software to increase our system performance, reduce cost and increase reliability. We also ramped up our marketing spend in the back half of the year with new product launches and branding For Q4, accruals for post combination expenses from prior acquisitions are expected to be approximately $3.6 million. 
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

So just to give a general color on the storage business so that you understand why our demand is picking up. We introduced the Storage Systems in July of 2020. It's a beautiful product, distributed architecture, modular AC-coupled lithium-ion phospha",582,"Yes. So just to give a general color on the storage business so that you understand why our demand is picking up. We introduced the Storage Systems in July of 2020. It's a beautiful product, distributed architecture, modular AC-coupled lithium-ion phosphate chemistry, air cooled. And of course, we had interesting features like power start, which helped us to optimize, starting an air conditioner, et cetera. And of course, Enphase customer service, which my expectations are that we will get better and better and better with our NPS beyond 70 in the future. We've learned a lot in the last year, especially when it comes to homeowner experience, the kind of notifications they need to get. And when it comes to installers, ease of use, ease of install, ease of commissioning. So a lot of learning has gone into it. We have made continuous hardware and software updates in the last year. And I told you in the last earnings call that we introduced Load Control in May of 2021. Load Control helped quite a bit in terms of customer experience. We are finding that's quite successful. There's a lot of uptick. And simultaneously, along with the introduction of Load Control, we also optimized our pricing. Initially, we did start a little bit high and then we thought it was the right time to optimize pricing. So we did that and we improved. With the improvement in commissioning with Load Control, with the drop in pricing, we started seeing a lot of demand. So Q3 obviously unleashed a lot of demand and that's the number you saw 50% growth from Q2. And that demand has continued to stay healthy as we improve our product more and more and more. So there is no demand limitation for Q4. For Q4, we said we would do anywhere between 90 and 100-megawatt hours. And primarily, that's gated by logistics. As you know, the situation globally is quite dynamic. Containers are scarce to find. The container costs have increased 8x. Ocean freight has increased 8x. The typical container used to cost a couple of thousand dollars is now $16,000. So there's a lot of stress in logistics, a lot of stress in supply chain situation. That's kind of limiting our supply in Q4. We are going to ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours. However, one thing which I didn't talk about is we are really happy at the adoption of the product by our long tail of installers. Really, if you see the statistics say, it's kind of astounding. We have trained 1,700 installation companies through our Enphase University. And 1,000 -- over 1,000 of them are certified. Certified means not only they have to complete the training, they have to complete a real in stock with Enphase on the line guiding them. And there's over 1,000 installers were certified right now. So we expect that number to continuously increase. We expect the demand to be broad-based. We expect the demand to go up and up and up. And of course, the logistics situation needs to improve globally. It's not situation specific to Enphase. We are covered from our contract manufacturers and our cell pack capacity, et cetera, like what I said, we are covered from that. It's purely a logistics issue, and we expect, therefore, ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours. With regarding Q1, I'm afraid I cannot talk much right now about Q1 because the situation is so dynamic that whatever I say will be wrong tomorrow."

You got the IQ 8 coming in. And then presumably less or lessening supply chain and logistics costs as you head into 2022. I know you can't crystal ball that. But if you kind of take all of that into account, it seems like there's a setup here, where you should be earning significantly higher gross margins at some point next year, assuming some of these things normalize. So can you kind of speak to that a bit? I mean, where you're at today and why you wouldn't be at a significantly higher gross margin at some point as you move through next year?"

If you see our component suppliers, the folks who supply components to the microinverters and batteries are in the same situation as us. They are increasing a lot of costs on us. And some of the component costs have gone up by over 100%. And because the supply chain is so tight, I have to air ship many microinverters, which cost a lot of money. Not only on top of that, ocean freight, I just now told you. Ocean freight is 8x more expense. So you cannot here, right? Wherever I go, the costs are going up tremendously. What we did was we have made a lot of cost reductions over the last year. So we were able to absorb some of the cost increases. And we try to absorb a lot of them, but we are in a situation where we have to pass some modest cost increase, I mean, some modest price increases to customers. That's what we exactly did. Now I don't have a crystal ball with me. I do not know whether 2022 brings in better logistics anytime sooner. And I'm not sure what's going to happen to the component costs that the suppliers are charging. But it's fair to say the next 2 or 3 quarters, the situation is probably not going to die down. And so our gross margins are -- I cannot predict what's going to happen in Q1. Q4, we gave you a guidance, and we are sticking with that guidance."

So therefore, we are in a place where we are stuck, where we transport these batteries through the ocean. And we are in the same game as everybody else. When the situation gets better in terms of all the port congestions improving, in terms of the shipping constraints going away, then we'll start to see the lead times drop to their natural number, which is around 8 weeks.

And what have we done? The team is a very smart team. Obviously, they were affected a little bit by COVID, they had some hiring limitations, but all of those are resolved. Right now, the team is firing on all cylinders. They understand exactly the improvements that we have to do, which is we are working on we are working on 3D, we are working on adding storage, and we expect all of those to be added and released by early next year. 
And so that will become a best-in-class tool for installers. Now the second one is another company called DIN. DIN does proposal and permitting services. This is -- an installer says, here is the address of the home, I want a proposal in 8 hours. Or here are the details about the contract details. I want a permit plan set you to create a permit plan set and give it to me in 24 hours. So the Enphase Noida team, Noida is a city in Northern India. And that team basically does proposal and permitting services, very healthy growth in Q4 and servicing right now big installers. There, the name of the game for us is how are we going to get the automation of the permit plan set. So that we can increase the quality and the turnaround time -- and keep the turnaround time to near 0. We are working on automation of those permit plan sets. And once that is done, then I will introduce that capability to all our long tail installers. Those 2 are doing -- just to summarize, those 2 are doing exceptionally well. They hit records in Q2.

I already talked about the logistics situation, which is not in our control. Whatever was in our control was the AC FET driver supply. What we did was we basically pivoted. We had 2 suppliers last -- early this year, which we -- which I think in Q2, it was 3, now it is 5 suppliers. So really, we have solved the problem of the AC FET driver simply by hard work and qualifying a lot more suppliers. Now let's come to IQ 8. IQ 8 offers a lot of interesting possibility. Why is IQ 8 -- Why we think IQ 8 is going to make a huge difference, is till now homeowners are under the assumption that their solar system will not produce power or will produce power during the grid outage as long as the sun is shining. We -- only a few of us know that, that is not true. A standard solar system needs the grid voltage and frequency as a reference. So therefore, during a grid shutdown, you don't have that voltage and frequency as a reference. Therefore, there is no power from a standard solar system. We are changing that paradigm. IQ 8 is a micro grid forming microinverter. So we think this opens up very interesting possibilities. And one other thing about IQ 8 is it does not require any particular storage size to be paired with it. In other words, at the -- in the extreme case, if there is no storage, the ratio of solar to storage is infinity. There is solar on the roof, there is no storage, you device it is infinity. So our IQ 8 is blazing fast and can adjust itself to any kind of grid conditions. Having said that, use case 2, which I talked about, sunlight backup. It's back up using the sunlight without storage. That's use case to in the event of a grid -- in the event of a grid outage. Now we think our customers would mainly buy a small battery along with it because when a cloud cover comes, you don't want to lose power. So at that time, you want some there. So a small battery will be perfect in order to make sure you have enough resilience that you don't need to buy a large battery. You can buy a small battery. Some people might say, no, I'm just happy with solar. I only need -- I only lose power twice a year. I'm happy with solar and sunlight backup, which is use case 2, is perfectly fine. So homeowners have their own way of choosing what they want according to their needs. But Enphase will provide the entire range of what they need with the help of our installers. Because installers are extremely important to educate the homeowners there. So that education process will take some time. And as normal with any new product, there will be a ramp, but this product is going to be a game changer. When you have a grid product and when you have a grid agnostic product side by side, you have to question who is going to buy the grid product. So I'll just -- I didn't give you specific numbers, but we are excited about IQ 8, and we think it's going to make a huge difference for our business going forward."

But the beta installations, which I call billet installations are happening this quarter. And IQ 8D is really a product with fantastic cost structure. You have 640 watts of AC and they are all packed into a form factor that's only slightly bigger than IQ 8. And it is perfect for the small commercial business. Maintaining very high quality, still the Enphase quality and the small commercial business folks can accept a 2-panel, 1 micro solution. So to answer your question, we are going to be introducing IQ 8. We are going to start ramping in the first quarter. Not only we are -- let me step back. We are actually thinking about IQ 8 as not a microinverter only. We are thinking about it as an entire system. What do I mean by an entire system is an asset manager or an installer comes to our website and wants to design a product for a building, for a gas station, for a hotel, for a school. We will enable all possible tools. He will be able to go and draw what he wants on the roof. He'll be able to estimate and get a quick proposal. He'll be able to go and do permitting services that he needs. And in short -- and one more important thing, fleet management. He'll be able to manage his fleet and have enormous flexibility on doing what he wants. He'll be able to see, on a given day, whether he was profitable or not, on a given day, if he made money, he'll be able to get incredible resolution on which microinverters doesn't work. And with the touch of a button, he'll be able to call in phase. So we are thinking about it end-to-end fully. And this is with a view towards the asset managers, with the view towards the installers, the end-to-end system. So that's why we have taken a little bit of time. But having said that, like what I said, we are going to pilot it in Q4 and start ramping in Q1."

It is basically the power is getting higher and higher and higher. And if you want to dissipate the higher power through a same form factor, you need innovation. And when you start looking at innovation, there is innovation that needs to happen in the transistors, which are what I call it the output AC transistors as well as the DC transistors. Innovation needs to happen there. The innovation needs to happen in the ASIC that's relatively easy, needs to run at a higher frequency. Innovation needs to happen at the transformer level because now the transformer can be a lot lesser if you run the AC transistors at higher frequency. So it needs all 3 of these to work in tandem. We need a transistor that's capable of tolerating much higher current and much small -- in much smaller form factor. The second is an ASIC that's capable of driving to that frequency. The third is a transformer that can be miniaturized to gain advantage from the increased frequency. All 3 of them are going to be worked on in IQ 9. So that we can deliver even more higher power with smaller form factors. Let's stop with that. Bottom line, it's innovation, you'll hear it. And -- but in the meantime, we got IQ 8. IQ 8 is the innovation in the IQ 8 ASIC enables the response time to grid events to be significantly faster, orders of magnitude faster than IQ 7. That's so we can get away with any storage sizing. So IQ 8 is -- like what I said, I've already said it, we couldn't be more excited. And there's a lot of innovation in IQ 8 that's still going to come as incremental products. For example, IQ 8H. IQ 8H is the highest power version that we have today. That's the highest power version we have made at Enphase is 384 watts of ASIC. In IQ 7, we had a IQ 7a, which was 366 watts. So we'll continuously tweak the power as we -- to do incremental products. But IQ 8 is a great product."

In this case, the competitor is a formidable competitor. We have a lot of respect for them. They have a big balance sheet. We're not sure what they're going to do, but we are focused on what we can do. We have made 8 generations of microinverters. We have very strong IP, 300-plus patents. All of these microinverters are based on the ASIC. The chip semiconductor architecture that has got an ASIC custom designed by Enphase. And that custom designed by Enphase enables us to do a single-stage architecture. Because we do a single-stage architecture versus the standard dual-stage architecture, what happens is we use reduced number of components. Because we have reduced number of components, our heat dissipation is a lot lesser. Because our dissipation is a lot lesser, our quality is high. As I always have said, my target DPPM is 500. 500 parts per million for microinverter. That's 0.05%. We are talking about. And that kind of outstanding quality comes due to our custom ASIC architecture and high level of semiconductor integration. So that's what we have done over time. And now to on the cake, it is IQ 8 is good for. It is -- it can do sunlight backup in the absence of a power grid without a battery. So that's where we are going. And when you ask me about next, I did talk a little bit on IQ 9 and IQ 10. Right now, IQ 8 has got single-phase grid farming. Soon, we will have 3-phase grid farming. So that's the direction we are going. So it's all about innovation for us. Innovation will drive high quality, high quality will drive great customer experience. That's what we are all about."

So you can track our past record on that front. In terms of the moving parts, we feel in many ways that our detailed bottoms-up forecasting process and the way we manage our cost and the opportunities that we have based on our technology that Badri just described, provide us unique visibility over perhaps a few quarters ahead of us. But right now, based on the reality of the logistics, I mean, another example just to give you, the spot pricing on components. In many cases, the availability of components, you need to pay additional price. And so some of them can be short term. Some of them they may stay with us. In the meantime, we continue very disciplined on our cost reduction road maps and attaining those. So within the visibility that we have, within the guidance that we provided that hopefully is very consistent. And the way we've been conducting ourselves in the past even under the extreme supply constraint challenges, we know how to manage fairly well within the quarter.

And we need to make sure we help them to put the best foot forward with the homeowners. And that process does take a little bit of time. That's why we thought success for us is 4 to 6. So obviously, 4, I would be thrilled; 6, I would look for a lot more improvements we can do in the future. But I think it's a reasonable number right now."

But it's really all about Europe. Latin America is a region that we are excited about, especially Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is very strong for us in terms of storage. We expect continued growth in Puerto Rico, both solar and storage in the next few quarters. Brazil is another one you should be looking at, you should be watching closely. And in Brazil, it's too early to talk about numbers, but it is a big market, 1.6 gigawatts of solar. Of course, it is a cutthroat market. But I think with some intelligence with some -- with some intelligent way to sell the product and with products like the IQ 8D; along with our products like the IQ 7A, which is the highest power products, we should be able to make a serious debt coupled with innovative financing. So we'll be working on that a lot, but we are excited about Brazil. It's a huge opportunity for us. So that's the color on international, mainly Europe for now."

And -- but yes, I get that question a lot, is storage -- what's the margin on storage, what are you confident about, et cetera. I want to mention the following. We just started shipping storage last year. We are ramping. It took us some time to ramp. We were in the early stages before. Our cost is usually -- it's common knowledge that the cost is high, relatively at an earlier stage of ramp and that situation is changing. We are streamlining everything as far as the product is concerned, the supply chain, the manufacturing, the cost structure, et cetera. We are also working on new products, which I will share with at the Analyst Day. Very often in store at the 2 metrics to focus on are basically kilowatt hours per liter. And actually, watt hours per liter and watt hours per kilogram. Those are the 2 metrics to focus on. And for us, the way we can maximize watt hours per liter -- if you maximize that, obviously, your cost comes down. Manufacturing cost, product cost comes down. And how do you maximize that is by building best-in-class power electronics because things that pack is pretty decent. But if you take the cell pack on 1 hand and if you take power electronics, those are the 2 things that you need to work on. Cell pack is already pretty decent. So we're working on power electronics to to do best-in-class integration, and we'll share more of our thoughts on the Analyst Day, but we are working on those seriously. And those will help us to achieve best-in-class cost structure on storage. And remember, we will not enter any business until we are confident unless we are confident that they will meet our target base line. That's why we set the target baseline, and we won't enter businesses where we cannot achieve them at a minimum."

It is right now, we think the long tail installers are neglected in this segment, which is specifically -- and I wouldn't call it as a niche segment. It's a small commercial segment.

We are talking about relatively small install base here. And so the name of the game for us is the same. Provide great customer experience to our installers, provide highest quality to our installers. The installers do have a pain point. A lot of the solutions they have today are not high quality. That's where Enphase can add value. And that's what we are going to do with the IQ 8B product. Address that 20 to 200-kilowatt segment and try to win over that segment, win over the installers who service that segment. And one of the ways we think we can win over is by offering a complete solution. It's not just micros. It is you talk about the design soft -- in solar design software and then proposals, then permits, then fleet management, then operations and maintenance with best-in-class quality micro invert. Now of course, I mean, one of the other things which again, we'll share our thoughts on in the Analyst Day is a small commercial solar also begs the question of small commercial storage. So we'll share a little bit of our thoughts there. But for now, it is just to answer it in 1 line, it's a very similar dynamics of installers. They all want high-quality and great service.

I'm hoping that will happen here. And so that's one. That's the success. The second one is we are able to  enable -- I mean we are able to have our realized cost effective Storage Systems sizes for the market. In other words, let's say, I have a 6-kilowatt solar system, I don't need 16-kilowatt hours storage systems. How about I only get 6-kilowatt storage system just for the essential backup I mean. How about I have enormous flexibility in that choice. I should be able to get a 3, if I need to 3-kilowatt hour because all I care is, let's say, my requirement as a homeowner, let us say, is only to keep the lights on or my UPS on. I should be able to do that with minimal cost and 0 constraints. So it's going to enable all kinds of use cases with a range of batteries. And hopefully, it's going to make the overall system affordable for a lot more people. And in the extreme case, the case with no storage, which is sunlight backup only, there may be some population who say, you know what, I'm okay. I lose power only like what I said earlier in the call, 2x a year, maybe 5 times a year. And at that time, I'm perfectly happy if I get -- if I have back power only during the day, right? So success for me is the batteries become a lot more common, which is the use case 3, which is IQ 8 solar systems with small-sized batteries, just start at every home. But that's me. The -- without respect the homeowners have their own way of choosing things. And that installers are going to help them to make the correct choice for them.

We had a good quarter. We reported record revenue of $351.5 million, shipped approximately 2.6 million microinverters and 65-megawatt hours of Enphase S",2191,"Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results. We had a good quarter. 
We reported record revenue of $351.5 million, shipped approximately 2.6 million microinverters and 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.8% and generated strong free cash flow of $100.7 million. 
We exited the third quarter at approximately 41%, 16%, 24%. This means 41% gross margin, 16% operating expenses and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. Our CFO, Eric, will go into detail about our financials later in the call. 
Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q3 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 67%, and our North American Net Promoter Score was 71%, both unchanged from Q2. 
Our average call wait time went up a little bit and was at 5.5 minutes in Q3 compared to 3 minutes in Q2, primarily related to the growth in our business. We are working on reducing call wait times to under a minute through additional staffing and training. We have increased the number of field service teams in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers, particularly for storage. We remain laser focused on customer experience.
Let's talk about manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past earnings calls, the global supply chain is under stress. Our situation is getting primarily better due to our hard work in qualifying alternate suppliers. For the AC FET drivers, we now have 5 suppliers qualified. Our supply of AC FET drivers is much better in Q4 than the prior quarters. 
For the ASICs used in our microinverters, we are a little bit tight on supply, but we expect to manage the situation. While we are happy with the overall supply for Q4, the situation is quite dynamic worldwide for both supply chain as well as logistics. We remain vigilant and cautious given the growing demand. 
So given our strong demand, we are adding a fully automated line in Mexico in Q4, bringing our quarterly capacity in Mexico to approximately 2.2 million microinverters. We have already added a second fully automated line in Q2 at our contract manufacturing partner in India, bringing that quarterly capacity to over 1.5 million microinverters in India.
Along with our existing capacity in China, we expect to easily achieve our target global capacity of 5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of the year. We have now geographically diversified 2/3 of our contract manufacturing capacity outside of China. 
Let's now talk about batteries. Our 2 sources for battery cell packs have increased their capacity to a total of approximately 180-megawatt hours per quarter from 120. Our existing suppliers are capable of adding more capacity required. In the meantime, we are working on adding additional suppliers in 2022 to achieve global diversification. 
Our lead times for Storage Systems are long today at approximately 14 weeks due to the global logistics challenges. These lead times will come down once the shipping constraints and port congestion improve. Despite these headwinds, we expect to increase shipments of our Enphase Storage Systems by approximately 45% sequentially in Q4. 
Let's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 76% and 24%, respectively. The U.S. market demand was quite strong in Q3, and we reported record revenue. We had record sell-through from our distribution partners to installers for both microinverters and storage. While our microinverter channel inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q3, our storage channel inventory remained tight due to strong demand and logistics issues. We expect microinverter channel inventory to remain manageable in Q4 and expect storage channel inventory to get better.
In Europe, we reported record revenue in Q3. We continue to have solid growth in Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain. Our Storage business in Germany is just getting started, and we are continuing to train a lot of installers. In September, we announced our entry into Italy, where we are providing IQ 7 family of microinverters to residential installers. Earlier this month, in October, we began selling Enphase Storage Systems to customers in Belgium, further expanding the products availability in Europe. Overall, I'm very pleased with our growth in Europe.
In Asia Pacific region, revenue declined a little bit in Q3, primarily due to ongoing COVID lockdowns in Australia. Despite the disruptions, we are pleased with the growth of the Enphase Installer Network, the continued adoption of our high power IQ 7A product and growing strength of our AC module partnerships. 
In Latin America, we reported record revenue in Q3, largely due to the increased sales of Solar and Storage Systems in Puerto Rico. We are quite optimistic about our business in Puerto Rico and expect steady growth in the next few quarters, especially in Storage. We also announced our entry into Brazil in September and started shipping IQ 7+ microinverters to installers in early October. 
Now that we have covered the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q4. Our overall customer demand for Q4 once again exceeds the higher end of our guidance. The component availability is currently much better in Q4 compared to Q3, but not fully there yet. We are optimistic that our supply will catch up the demand by early next year. 
Let's now move to an update on our Storage Systems. We shipped 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in Q3, which was a 51% increase from Q2. Let's discuss the training for our Enphase Storage Systems. By the end of Q3, we had trained 3,771 installer personnel, representing approximately 1,700 unique installation companies. Our hands-on storage installation training through our mobile vans and training centers also started ramping in Q3 with electricians and lead installers attending training sessions and experiencing valuable hands-on time with real systems. 
We are working diligently on our Enphase Storage Systems to improve commissioning times for installers. With the rapid increase in the number of long-tail installers, our average commissioning time is approximately 2.5 hours in Q3. We are working hard to bring this time down and made numerous updates in Q3. Our goal remains a sub-60-minute commissioning time, which will allow installers to visit the site, install and commission an Enphase Storage Systems in less than a few hours. 
We've recently introduced 2 new features for our Enphase Storage Systems. In late May, we introduced load control, which provides homeowners the ability to conserve their energy consumption by shedding nonessential loads during an outage, and thereby extending the backup duration. We have 4 circuits for load control designed into our smart switch. These loads will be on when the grid is present and shed automatically in the event of a grid failure. This feature is configurable and controllable by the homeowner via our Enphase app. 
Last week, we announced that our home energy systems will soon integrate with most leading models of home standby AC generators, providing enhanced performance and a glitch-free transition for homeowners during power outages. Homeowners can monitor real-time the power flow, start and stop their generator remotely, set quite hours to prevent their generated from operating until their batteries fall below a certain state of charge, and control it all with the Enphase app. This new feature functions without a dedicated generator automatic transfer switch, and eliminates the power glitches that reset home appliances when switching to generator power. This new feature will be available to installers in the U.S. in November. 
With the addition of these new features, plus our laser focus on customer experience, we continue to see an acceleration in demand for our Enphase Storage Systems. As a result, we expect to ship between 90 and 100-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in Q4. 
Let's talk about new products. Yesterday, we announced the all-new all-in-one Enphase Energy System with IQ8 solar microinverters for customers in North America. IQ8 is Enphase's smartest microinverter yet. Unlike competing devices, IQ8 can form a microgrid during a power outage using sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery.
Since the company's inception, we have invested in custom application specific integrated chips for our microinverters. And today, we see a big payoff with a software-defined microinverters, smart enough to form a microgrid. Many homeowners often assume that their solar systems will function if the sun is shining even during a power outage. This is unfortunately not been true until today. Now with IQ8, homeowners can realize the true promise of solar to make and use their own power. IQ8 solar microinverters can provide sunlight backup during an outage even without a battery. 
The Enphase Energy System with IQ8 comes in 4 different configurations. The first is solar only, which is a standard grid-tied system that everybody is used to today. The second is sunlight backup, which I just talked about, without a battery. The third is very interesting, it's home essentials backup with a small battery for cloud cover and nighttime backup. The fourth is full energy independent, a solar system with IQ8 and a large battery. So while the first configuration, as I mentioned, is a standard grid-tied system. The remaining 3 configurations are grid-agnostic system, which need an Enphase System controller or a smart switch to which islands the home during an outage. For homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions on pairing an Enphase battery with an IQ8 solar system. All the configurations can be customized for homeowners with the help of our valued Enphase installer partners.
We started piloting IQ8 to select installers in Q3, and we will be ramping shipments in Q4 beginning December. We expect the IQ8 ramp to take 4 to 6 quarters much like the IQ7 ramp. 
Let me also say a few words about IQ8D. So IQ8D is a high-power 640-watt AC microinverter capable of supporting 2 DC panels, primarily for the small commercial solar business. We expect to start piloting IQ8D with select installers in Q4 and begin production shipments in Q1. This product is very important to us, not only for the small commercial solar business, but also for our next-generation batteries as we increase the discharge power and improve our cost structure.
Let's turn to digital transformation. Both of our recent acquisitions achieved record revenue in Q3. Enphase Montreal, which provides design and proposal software, added a significant number of new installers. We plan to release several new software features early next year to improve the installer experience. Enphase Noida, which provides proposal and permitting services for installers, also experienced a significant increase in customer demand and is focused on automating the creation of permit plan sets to further expand the installer base. Both teams will significantly leverage the Enphase Installer Network to grow and expand their business. 
Let me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded approximately 1,000 installers to our Enphase Installer Network worldwide through a highly selective process focused on quality and homeowner experience. Our EIN in the U.S. has grown 57% since its introduction last year. We are very pleased with this initiative's progress and are thankful to our installers who act as our product evangelists and provide an exceptional experience to homeowners. 
Let's talk about grid services. Last quarter, we discussed our participation in the ConnectedSolutions program, which is an incentive program implemented by 3 utilities in the Northeast U.S. to reduce electrical demand during high-use periods. Our storage customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts  and Rhode Island can sign up, monitor, track money earned and control participation in the program using the Enphase app. 
We were pleased to announce in Q3 our participation in the Hawaiian Electric’s Battery Bonus grid services program. This program offers a new incentive for homeowners on the island of Oahu who installed a new home battery. The first customers accepted by Hawaiian Electric into the program will be eligible to receive $850 per kilowatt that they commit to make available during a fixed 2-hour period each day. The program helps Hawaiian Electric realize the goal of 100% renewable power by 2045 and more homeowners than ever before can now have a solar plus storage system. We expect to engage with more such utilities and aggregators in our grid services program during the months ahead. 
In summary, we are pleased with the overall progress we have made this year. We now have solar, storage, load control, grid services and generator compatibility as part of our home energy management system. We are making significant progress on the digital platform for installers in order to cut soft costs. We will remain laser-focused on both the products and the digital platform to deliver a superior customer experience for both our installers and homeowners.
I'd like to make one more important announcement. We will be hosting an Investor Day on November 16 to provide a deeper update on our business. More details will follow over the next few weeks. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our finances. Eric?"

I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2021 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Total revenue for Q3 was $351.5 million, representing an increase of 11% sequentially an a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 913 megawatts DC of microinverters and 65-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 40.8%, the same as compared to Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin was impacted by higher logistics and expedite costs partially offset by a price increase on microinverters and continued cost management.  GAAP gross margin was 39.9% for Q3. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $57.3 million for Q3 compared to $51.7 million for Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investments in R&D, IT infrastructure and brand awareness marketing programs.  
GAAP operating expenses were $103 million for Q3 compared to $68.4 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $44 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $1.6 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring intangible assets. 
On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $85.9 million compared to $77.2 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $37.4 million for Q3 compared to $59.4 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $84.2 million compared to $74.7 million for Q2. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.60 for Q3 compared to $0.53 per share for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $21.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $39.4 million for Q2. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.15 for Q3 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for Q2. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and the working capital front. Inventory was $65.4 million at the end of Q3 compared to $37.8 million at the end of Q2. The sequential increase was due to the expected higher demand for our Enphase Solar and Storage Systems in Q4 as well as longer lead times due to current global logistics and supply chain challenges. 
Days of inventory outstanding was 28 days at the end of Q3 compared to 18 days at the end of Q2 to support the growth in the demand. Our target is 30 days.
Accounts receivable were $273 million at the end of Q3 compared to $281.2 million at the end of Q2. DSO of 54 days in Q3 decreased from [ 65 ] days in the prior quarter. 
We exited Q3 with a total cash and cash equivalent and market-related securities balance of approximately $1.4 billion compared to approximately $1.3 billion at the end of Q2. We did not make any share repurchases against our recently approved $500 million share repurchase authorization. In Q3, we generated $113.4 million in cash flow from operations and $100.7 million on free cash flow. Capital expenditures was $12.7 million for Q3 to expand both, microinverters and storage manufacturing capacity as well as costs related to app development, website and IT.  
Now let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect our revenue for the quarter to be within a range of $390 million to $410 million, which includes shipments of 90 to 100-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses. 
We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $119 million to $122 million, including a total of approximately $52 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $67 million to $70 million. 
Let me provide some additional color on a few topics. The revenue guidance assumes an increase in microinverter shipments, including IQ8 as well as Storage System shipments. We expect to ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours of Enphase Storage Systems in Q4, representing approximately 45% sequential growth at the midpoint of the guidance. We expect improved component availability for microinverter production in Q4 and continued momentum for the Enphase Storage Systems.
On the cost side, we are continuing to expedite components and finished goods in Q4 to ensure customers have an adequate supply of our products. We expect the quarterly expedite expenses to remain at similar levels of Q3. Due to the steep increase in logistic costs and increase in component costs driven by inflation, we are implementing a modest price increase on all products starting in the second half of Q4. It is also prudent for us to maintain our baseline financial model as we continue to navigate the global component supply constraints and logistics challenges.
Finally, I would like to touch upon our OpEx guidance. Our guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, is expected to increase in Q4. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, our OpEx may be slightly above our 15% target at times, but we still expect to be comfortably above our baseline target of 20% operating income. We continue to invest significantly in R&D to further our competitive advantage. Significantly, we are more focused on semiconductor integration in -- of our ASIC and software advancement, including cloud software to increase our system performance, reduce cost and increase reliability. We also ramped up our marketing spend in the back half of the year with new product launches and brand awareness. 
For Q4, accruals for post combination expenses from prior acquisitions are expected to be approximately $3.6 million.
With that, I will now open the line for questions."

So to just give a general color on the Storage business so that you understand why our demand is picking up. We introduced the Storage Systems in July of 2020. It's a beautiful product, distributed architecture, modular AC-coupled lithium-ion phospha",586,"Yes. So to just give a general color on the Storage business so that you understand why our demand is picking up. We introduced the Storage Systems in July of 2020. It's a beautiful product, distributed architecture, modular AC-coupled lithium-ion phosphate safe chemistry, air cooled. And of course, we had interesting features like power start, which helped us to optimize, starting an air conditioner, et cetera. And of course, Enphase customer service, which my expectations are that we will get better and better and better with our NPS beyond 70 in the future. 
We've learned a lot in the last year, especially when it comes to homeowner experience, the kind of notifications they need to get and when it comes to installers, ease of use, ease of install, ease of commissioning. So a lot of learning has gone into it. We have made continuous hardware and software updates in the last year. 
And I told you in the last earnings call that we introduced load control in May of 2021. Load control helped quite a bit in terms of customer experience. We are finding that's quite successful. There's a lot of uptick. And simultaneously, along with the introduction of load control, we also optimized our pricing. Initially, we did start a little bit high and then we thought it is the right time to optimize pricing. So we did that and we improved -- with the improvement in commissioning with load control, with the drop in pricing, we started seeing a lot of demand. 
So Q3 obviously unleashed a lot of demand and that's the number you saw, 50% growth from Q2. And that demand has continued to stay healthy as we improve our product more and more and more. So there is no demand limitation for Q4. For Q4, we said we would do anywhere between 90 and 100-megawatt hours. And yes primarily, that's gated by logistics. 
As you know, the situation globally is quite dynamic. Containers are scarce to find. The container costs have increased 8x. Ocean freight has increased 8x. The typical container used to cost a couple of thousand dollars is now $16,000. So there's a lot of stress in logistics, a lot of stress in supply chain situation. That's kind of limiting our supply in Q4. We are going to ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours. However, one thing which I didn't talk about is, we are really happy at the adoption of the product by our long tail of installers. 
Really, if you see the statistics, it's kind of astounding. We have trained 1,700 installation companies through our Enphase University. And 1,000 -- over 1,000 of them are certified. Certified means not only they have to complete the training, they have to complete a real install with Enphase on the line guiding them. And there's over 1,000 installers were certified right now. So we expect that number to continuously increase. We expect the demand to be broad-based. We expect the demand to go up and up and up. And of course, the logistics situation needs to improve globally. It's not situation specific to Enphase. We are covered from our contract manufacturers and our cell pack capacity, et cetera, like what I said, we are covered from that. It's purely a logistics issue, and we expect, therefore to ship 90 to 100-megawatt hours. With regarding Q1, yes, I'm afraid I cannot talk much right now about Q1 because now the situation is so dynamic that whatever I say will be wrong tomorrow."

And this year, you have the 2 price increases, you've got the IQ8 coming in. And then presumably less or lessening supply chain and logistics costs as you head into 2022. I know you can't crystal ball that, but if you kind of take all of that into account, it seems like there's a setup here, where you should be earning significantly higher gross margins at some point next year, assuming some of these things normalize. So can you kind of speak to that a bit? I mean, where you're at today and why you wouldn't be at a significantly higher gross margin at some point as you move through next year?"

If you see our component suppliers, the folks who supply components to the microinverters and batteries are in the same situation as us. They are increasing a lot of costs on us. And some of the component costs have gone up by over 100%. And because the supply chain is so tight, I have to air ship many microinverters, which cost a lot of money. Not only on top of that, ocean freight, I just now told you, ocean freight is 8x more expense. So you cannot hide here, right? Wherever I go, the costs are going up tremendously. What we did was, we have made a lot of cost reductions over the last year. So we were able to absorb some of the cost increases. And we try to absorb a lot of them, but we are in a situation where we have to pass some modest cost increase, I mean, some modest price increase to customers. That's what we exactly did. 
Now I don't have a crystal ball with me. I do not know whether 2022 brings in better logistics anytime sooner. And I'm not sure what's going to happen to the elevated component costs that the suppliers are charging. But it's fair to say the next 2 or 3 quarters, the situation is probably not going to die down. And so our gross margins are -- I cannot predict what's going to happen in Q1. Q4, we gave you a guidance, and we are sticking with that guidance."

And so the supply, it's all about the global logistics. And unfortunately, we cannot air ship batteries like microinverters. It just doesn't make sense economically to airship batteries. So therefore, we are in a place where we are stuck, where we transport these batteries through the ocean. And we are in the same game as everybody else. When the situation gets better in terms of all the port congestions now improving, in terms of the shipping constraints going away, then we'll start to see the lead times drop to their natural number, which is around 8 weeks.

Solargraf basically, the installers can go in there, they can draw the solar panels on the roof. They can get a proposal calculation, so that they can discuss at the kitchen table. 
And what have we done? The team is a very smart team. Obviously, they were affected a little bit by COVID, they had some hiring limitations, but all of those are resolved. Right now, the team is firing on all cylinders. They understand exactly the improvements that we have to do, which is we are working on shading, we are working on 3D, we are working on adding storage, and we expect all of those to be added and released by early next year, and so that will become a best-in-class tool for installers. 
Now the second one is another company called DIN. DIN does proposal and permitting services. This is, an installer says, ""Here is the address of the home, I want a proposal in 8 hours."" or ""Here are the details about the contract details, I want a permit plan set, you to create a permit plan set and give it to me in 24 hours."" So the Enphase Noida team, Noida is a city in Northern India. And that team basically does proposal and permitting services, very healthy growth in Q4 and servicing right now big installers. There, the name of the game for us is, how are we going to get the automation of the permit plan set. So that we can increase the quality and the turnaround time -- and keep the turnaround time to near 0. We are working on automation of those permit plan sets. And once that is done, then I will introduce that capability to all our long-tail installers. Those 2 are doing -- just to summarize, those 2 are doing exceptionally well. They hit records in Q2. They hit new records in Q3, and I expect them to perform well going forward."

Whatever was in our control was the AC FET driver supply. What we did was? We basically pivoted. We had 2 suppliers early this year, which we -- which I think in Q2, it was 3, now it is 5 suppliers. So really, we have solved the problem of the AC FET driver simply by hard work and qualifying a lot more suppliers. 
Now let's come to IQ8. IQ8 offers a lot of interesting possibility. Why is IQ8? Why we think IQ8 is going to make a huge difference is, till now homeowners are under the assumption that their solar system will not produce power or will produce power during a grid outage as long as the sun is shining. We -- only a few of us know that, that is not true. A standard solar system needs the grid voltage and frequency as a reference. So therefore, during a grid shutdown, you don't have that voltage and frequency as a reference. Therefore, there is no power from a standard solar system. We are changing that paradigm. IQ8 is a microgrid forming microinverter. So we think this opens up very interesting possibilities. 
And one other thing about IQ8 is, it does not require any particular storage size to be paired with it. In other words, at the -- yes, in the extreme case, if there is no storage, the ratio of solar to storage is infinity. There is solar on the roof, there is no storage, you device the 2 it is infinity. So our IQ8 is blazing fast and can adjust itself to any kind of grid conditions. 
Having said that, use case 2, which I talked about, sunlight backup. It's back up using the sunlight without storage. That's use case 2 in the event of a grid -- in the event of a grid outage. Now we think our customers would mainly buy a small battery along with it because when a cloud cover comes, you don't want to lose power. So at that time, you want some immunity there. So a small battery will be perfect in order to make sure you have enough resilience that you don't need to buy a large battery. You can buy a small battery. Some people might say, ""No, I'm just happy with solar. I only need -- I only lose power twice a year. I'm happy with solar and sunlight backup."" Which is use case 2, is perfectly fine. 
So homeowners have their own way of choosing what they want according to their needs. But Enphase will provide the entire range of what they need with the help of our installers. Because installers are extremely important to educate the homeowners there. So that education process will take some time. And as normal with any new product, there will be a ramp, but this product is going to be a game changer. When you have a grid type product and when you have a grid agnostic product side by side, you have to question who is going to buy a grid product. So I'll just -- I didn't give you specific numbers, but we are excited about IQ8, and we think it's going to make a huge difference for our business going forward."

But the beta installations, which I call pilot installations are happening this quarter. And IQ8D is really a product with fantastic cost structure.

Maintaining very high quality, still the Enphase quality and the small commercial business folks can accept a 2-panel, 1 micro solution. .
So to answer your question, we are going to be introducing IQ8. We are going to start ramping in the first quarter. Not only we are -- let me step back, we are actually thinking about IQ8 as a not a microinverter only. We are thinking about it as an entire system. What do I mean by an entire system is an asset manager or an installer comes to our website and wants to design a product for a building, for a gas station, for a hotel, for a school. We will enable all possible tools. He will be able to go and draw what he wants on the roof. He'll be able to estimate and get a quick proposal. He'll be able to go and do permitting services that he needs. And in short, and one more important thing, fleet management. He'll be able to manage his fleet and have enormous flexibility on doing what he wants. He'll be able to see, on a given day, whether he was profitable or not, on a given day, if he made money, he'll be able to get incredible resolution on which microinverters doesn't work. And with the touch of a button, he'll be able to call Enphase. So we are thinking about it end-to-end fully. 
And this is with a view towards the asset managers, with the view towards the installers with an end-to-end system. So that's why we have taken a little bit of time. But having said that, like what I said, we are going to pilot it in Q4 and start ramping in Q1."

The -- on IQ9, just a quick thing. It is basically the power is getting higher and higher and higher. And if you want to dissipate the higher power through a same form factor, you need innovation",362,"We'll talk a little bit more about IQ9 in the Investor Day. The -- on IQ9, just a quick thing. It is basically the power is getting higher and higher and higher. And if you want to dissipate the higher power through a same form factor, you need innovation. And when you start looking at innovation, there is innovation that needs to happen in the transistors, which are what I call is the output AC transistors as well as the DC transistors. Innovation needs to happen there. The innovation needs to happen in the ASIC that's relatively easy, needs to run at a higher frequency. The innovation needs to happen at the transformer level because now the transformer can be a lot lesser if you run the AC transistors at a higher frequency. 
So it needs all 3 of these to work in tandem. We need a transistor that's capable of tolerating much higher current and much small -- in much smaller form factor. The second is an ASIC that's capable of driving to that frequency. The third is a transformer that can be miniaturized to gain advantage from the increased frequency. All 3 of them are going to be worked on in IQ9. So that we can deliver even more higher power with smaller form factor. I'll stop at that. 
Bottom line, it's innovation, you'll hear it. And -- but in the meantime, we got IQ8. IQ8 is the innovation in the IQ8 ASIC enables the response time to grid events to be significantly faster, orders of magnitude faster than IQ7. That's how we can get away with any storage sizing. So IQ8 is, like what I said, I've already said it, we couldn't be more excited. And there's a lot of innovation in IQ8 that's still going to come as incremental products. For example, IQ8H. IQ8H is the highest power version that we have today. That's the highest power version we have made at Enphase is 384 watts of ASIC. In IQ7, we had a IQ7A, which was 366 watts. So we'll continuously tweak the power as we -- to do incremental products. But IQ8 is a great product."

Now we have seen a lot of competition in microinverters over the year -- I mean, over the years. We don't neglect any of them. We take all of them seriously. In this case, the competitor is a formidable competitor. We have a lot of respect for them. They have a big balance sheet. We're not sure what they're going to do, but we are focused on what we can do. We have made 8 generations of microinverters. We have very strong IP, 300-plus patents. All of these microinverters are based on the ASIC. The chip semiconductor architecture that has got an ASIC custom designed by Enphase. 
And that custom designed by Enphase enables us to do a single-stage architecture. Because we do a single-stage architecture versus the standard dual-stage architecture, what happens is, we use reduced number of components. Because we have reduced number of components, our heat dissipation is a lot lesser. Because our heat dissipation is a lot lesser, our quality is high. 
As I always have said, my target DPPM is 500. 500 parts per million for microinverter. That's 0.05%. We are talking about. And that kind of outstanding quality comes due to our custom ASIC architecture and high level of semiconductor integration. So that's what we have done over time. And now to add icing on the cake, it is IQ8 is grid farming. It is -- it can do sunlight backup in the absence of a power grid without a battery. So that's where we are going. And when you ask me about next, I did talk a little bit on IQ9 and IQ10. Right now, IQ8 has got single-phase grid farming, soon, we will have 3-phase grid farming. So that's the direction we are going. So it's all about innovation for us. Innovation will drive high quality, high quality will drive great customer experience. That's what we are all about."

So you can track our past record on that front, right?
In terms of the moving parts, we feel in many ways that our detailed bottoms-ups forecasting process and the way we manage our cost and the opportunities that we have based on our technology that Badri just described, provide us unique visibility over perhaps a few quarters ahead of us. But right now, based on the reality of the logistics, I mean, another example just to give you, the spot pricing on components, right? In many cases, the availability of components, we need to pay additional price. And so some of them can be short term. Some of them they may stay with us. 
In the meantime, we continue very disciplined on our cost reduction road maps and attaining those. So within the visibility that we have, within the guidance that we provided that hopefully is very consistent. And the way we've been conducting ourselves in the past even under the extreme supply constraint challenges, we know how to manage fairly well within the quarter.

And -- but yes, I get that question a lot, is storage -- what's the margin on storage? What are you confident about, et cetera. I want to mention the following. We just started shipping storage last year. We are ramping. It took us some time to ramp. We were in the early stages before. Our cost is usually -- it's common knowledge that the cost is high, relatively at an earlier stage of ramp and that situation is changing. We are streamlining everything as far as the product is concerned, the supply chain, the manufacturing, the cost structure, et cetera. 
We are also working on new products, which I will share with at the Analyst Day. Very often in storage the 2 metrics to focus on are basically kilowatt hours per liter. And actually, watt hours per liter and watt hours per kilogram. Those are the 2 metrics to focus on. 
And for us, the way we can maximize watt hours per liter -- if you maximize that, obviously, your cost comes down, manufacturing cost, product cost comes down. And how do you maximize that is by building best-in-class power electronics, because things that cell pack is pretty decent. But if you take the cell pack on one hand and if you take power electronics, those are the 2 things that you need to work on. Cell pack is already pretty decent. So we're working on power electronics to do best-in-class integration, and we'll share more of our thoughts in the Analyst Day, but we are working on those furiously. And those will help us to achieve best-in-class cost structure on storage. And remember, we will not enter any business until we are confident, unless we are confident that they will meet our target baseline. That's why we set a target baseline, and we won't enter businesses where we cannot achieve that."

We are talking about relatively small installers here. And so the name of the game for us is the same. Provide great customer experience to our installers, provide highest quality to our installers. The installers do have a pain point. A lot of the solutions they have today are not high quality. That's where Enphase can add value. And that's what we are going to do with the IQ8D product. Address that 20 to 200-kilowatt segment and try to win over that segment, win over the installers who service that segment. 
And one of the ways we think we can win over is by offering a complete solution. It's not just micros. It is you talk about the design soft -- in solar design software and then proposals, then permits, then fleet management, then operations and maintenance with best-in-class quality microinverter.
Now of course, I mean, one of the other things which again, we'll share our thoughts on the -- in the Analyst Day is a small commercial solar also begs the question of small commercial storage.

The second one is, we are able to enable -- I mean we are able to have our realized cost effective Storage Systems sizes for the market. 
In other words, let's say, I have a 6-kilowatt solar system, I don't need a 16-kilowatt hour storage systems. How about I only get 6-kilowatt storage system just for the essential backup I mean. How about I have enormous flexibility in that choice. I should be able to get a 3, if I need to 3-kilowatt hour because all I care is, let's say, my requirement as a homeowner, let us say, is only to keep the lights on or my UPS on. I should be able to do that with minimal cost with 0 constraints. So it's going to enable all kinds of use cases with a range of batteries. 
And hopefully, it's going to make the overall system affordable for a lot more people, right.

With all due respect the homeowners have their own way of choosing things. And our installers are going to help them to make the correct choice for them. And all I can do is to speculate nothing more."

And as we continue innovating, improving our quality and delivering products that are superior or potentially even groundbreaking like IQ8, right? We seem to believe that those are not necessarily compromised at least in the mid short term, right? 
As you think in the long term, new product introductions, more acquisitions, more activity. The company that you are looking today is a very different company than the company that I joined almost 4 years ago. And will continue to transform itself into the energy company that the market deserves. And we will continue delighting customers, continue discipline on our pricing strategies, cost reduction, again, using the best innovation available, negotiating with our vendors on a fair pricing based on volume discounts, providing the homeowner full visibility over their experiences. So therefore, they understand what they are gaining. So I think that, that's what he made us what it is today."

That, of course, is a supply capacity. It's a manufacturing capacity of our contract manufacturers. However, the components need to come into those plants and that's the enormously stressed supply chain. So we don't know when that will get alleviated. But once that gets alleviated, we should not be having any capacity issues or any supply issues until the capacity that we indicated. 
And beyond that, all of these, if I look at our Guad factory, for example, if we want more capacity, we need to put more auto lines in. If we look at our Chennai factory in India, same deal. If we look at our China factory, same deal. And that is only manufacturing capacity. But on the other hand, we deal with many hundreds of suppliers. Each of them will need to up their gain, and we will need to qualify multiple suppliers. For an example for a PCB today in a printed circuit board, today we have a couple of suppliers. We may need to take that up to full suppliers if  we are going to service extraordinarily higher demand beyond 5 million. So there's some structural changes, we will do, but it's something that we are used to doing. It requires a couple of quarters of notice in order to put an auto line, we can have it. It requires a couple of qualifications to be done with adding 2 extra suppliers like what we did on the  [ ASIC ] drive we can have it. It'll take a few quarters, but we're not afraid of the number 5 or 10 doesn't daunt us."
