Since our last earnings call, they've completed an historic peak season. And using the power of our expanded 7-day week FedEx Ground operations, our team handled record-breaking volumes throughout the holiday shipping season. They also worked diligently to clear the backlog caused by the recent severe winter weather in the U.S., a 50-year event. They worked night and day to move the backlog quickly and as safely as possible. This includes the many team members who typically perform other duties and volunteered their time to help. We're sincerely grateful to them and to our customers for their understanding as we navigated the effects of these massive winter storms. 
Our team members are continuing to move the world forward with the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines-related ingredients and supplies throughout the U.S., Canada and more than 20 other countries around the world. We did a great job on these vaccines during the weather event, too. FedEx is prepared to transport now vaccines to more than 220 countries and territories for as long as necessary to help eradicate COVID-19. 
As part of our responsibility to be good stewards of the planet, earlier this month, we announced our bold strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040. To help reach this goal, we focused our strategy in 3 key areas: Vehicle electrification, which we've been involved in for over a decade; sustainable energy; and carbon sequestration, natural carbon sequestration. In this regard, importantly, our plan includes a pledge to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. The center will build on the Yale legacy of the school and the environment of world-class research and education to develop measurable carbon capture solutions with an initial focus on helping to offset greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline emissions. Findings will be published and shared so that businesses, industries and governments globally can benefit from this work. 
As reflected in this quarter's results, continued execution of our strategies is producing strong earnings growth and margin improvement across our company. We expect demand for our unmatched e-commerce and International Express solutions to remain high for the foreseeable future. 
I'm exceedingly optimistic about the future of Fedex. And again, very grateful to our team members for their hard work. I'd also like to thank Henry Maier, President and CEO of FedEx Ground, who is retiring at the end of July after more than 35 years of dedicated service at Fedex. We'll have much more to say about Henry on our next earnings call in June. 
Let me now ask Raj, Brie and Mike to provide their comments, after which we will take your questions. Raj?"
124423,688620421,2239863,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 18, 2021",2021-03-18,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Fred, and good afternoon, everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter of growth for Fedex. Despite challenging circumstances, the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our company's history. This included delivering nearly",772,"Thank you, Fred, and good afternoon, everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter of growth for Fedex. Despite challenging circumstances, the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our company's history. This included delivering nearly 0.5 billion holiday packages, transporting the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines here in the U.S. and increasing collaboration across operating companies. 
Our results speak for themselves. In December, we achieved the highest monthly totals in our company's history in both revenue and operating profit. Results in December were different than previous years. We better maximized our available capacity, and as Brie will cover in a moment, better aligned prices to incremental costs. Peak 2020 was unlike any peak experience before and sets a new standard for future peak seasons. 
As Fred mentioned, our operations were impacted by last month's severe winter weather throughout the United States. Mike will expand more on the scope and unique nature of these storms. And I'm sure many of you have seen reports in the last couple of days, which illustrate the impact these storms had on the overall U.S. economy, including retail sales and manufacturing output. We implemented numerous contingencies to mitigate the impact, including adding sorts, line haul and collaborating across our network to assist in the recovery. I'm very proud of the team for managing through this very challenging situation. 
Now speaking of the team, we announced that Henry Maier will retire this summer and named John Smith, former President and CEO of FedEx Freight, his successor. Lance Moll, former SVP of Operations at FedEx Freight, has been promoted to CEO, and we're pleased to have all these 3 gentlemen on the call today. 
Now turning to FedEx Ground. The outstanding margin improvement for Ground in Q3 highlights the success of our ongoing strategic initiatives and investments to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with the last mile even amid record residential volume levels. These investments continue to pay off. 
Let me share 3 examples. Number one, we saw a meaningful improvement in last-mile efficiency as service providers improve their stocks per hour 21% year-over-year in Q3. Number two, the average cost per stock decreased by 12% year-over-year. And number three, we maximized our assets, expanding to 7-day operations and integrating ground economy, or formerly FedEx SmartPost, reduced our fixed cost per package by 4% year-over-year. We remain very optimistic for continued profitable growth at Ground. 
Collaboration between operating companies continue at an unprecedented rate in Q3. This month marks the 1-year anniversary of the launch of last-mile optimization, which allows us to flex our networks to increase delivery density for residential, rural and deferred packages. LMO will expand to 6 more markets effective May 1, increasing to 63 markets in total and covering 2/3 of the U.S. GDP. Additionally, FedEx Freight has delivered more than 1.75 million shipments for ground so far this fiscal year. This time last year, Freight had yet to deliver a single ground shipment as increased support for ground kicked off in May of 2020. 
Finally, turning to FedEx Express. Our global network is moving COVID-19 vaccines, ingredients and supplies as we speak. It has been a coordinated orchestration of our physical and digital capabilities. At FedEx Express, we expect elevated pricing for at least the next 12 months. We know, however, that these prices are not sustainable in the longer term, and we will flex our networks appropriately as commercial capacity returns into the market. In addition, we will continue to improve our efficiency by executing last-mile optimization and transforming our European business. 
In Europe, momentum continues with the physical integration of the TNT network. We recently announced our Europe restructuring program, and we are progressing with local consultations as planned and in accordance with local market regulations. April will be a big month as we prepare to roll out a set of new service capabilities for our customers, which Brie will provide more detail very shortly here. We'll complete their integration in spring 2022, which will bring the physical network integration to a close. Our Paris Hub will be our main Express hub in Europe with Liege serving as [ Indi das ] in the U.S. as our second largest European air hub. We remain focused on optimizing the network and strengthening our capabilities to drive upside in Europe for years to come. 
In closing, FedEx remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. We have the network, the strategy and the right team in place as we build upon the exceptional results we have seen so far in fiscal year '21. With that, let me turn it over to Brie."
124423,688620421,2239863,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 18, 2021",2021-03-18,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In the United States, we are seeing strong growth and momentum. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, with e-commerce contributing 86% of total U.",855,"Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In the United States, we are seeing strong growth and momentum. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, with e-commerce contributing 86% of total U.S. market growth. E-commerce as a percentage of U.S. retail sales was approximately 21% in Q4 of calendar year '20, significantly above the pre-pandemic level. 
We remain excited about the diversification and evolution of the e-commerce market. Some of our largest retail customers reported e-commerce growth rates in the high double and even triple digits through 2020. As the U.S. reopens, we recognize the potential for a short-term deceleration in e-commerce shopping. However, we are very confident that e-commerce, as a percentage of retail, has a long growth runway. 
Turning now to peak. It certainly was the ship [ upon ] we predicted, a peak upon a peak. We had tremendous growth with almost 500 million packages delivered and 19% year-over-year ADV growth. To the global sales and marketing teams, I could not be more proud of your execution and the momentum you have created. 
FY '21 parcel volume growth remains strong, supported by a portfolio of e-commerce solutions growing at double digits. Of particular note, our FedEx Ground 7-day-a-week residential delivery service is one of the fastest-growing services in e-commerce with 70% volume growth in Q3. Overall, year-to-date average daily volume growth remains strong for all customer segments. However, our U.S. small and medium segment grew 35% through the end of February. 
In FY '21 Q3, FedEx total U.S. domestic residential package volume mix was 70% versus 62% a year ago. With the increase of residential packages in our networks, we're focused on improving yield and product mix. In FY '21 Q3, we increased FedEx Ground economy yield by 35% and overall U.S. domestic residential yields by 15% year-over-year. It's important to note FedEx Ground is formally FedEx SmartPost. 
While e-commerce is the key driver of the overall growth, in January, our U.S. enterprise B2B volume was at pre-COVID levels. 
Turning to our U.S. revenue quality strategy. We continue to actively pursue yield management, product and customer mix strategies. Our primary focus is ensuring large customer pricing aligns to their volume distribution. We continue to manage capacity at FedEx Ground, prioritizing our highest yielding SAM segment as well as our premium home delivery product. As we plan for peak of fiscal year '22, our peak surcharges will continue to play a critical role. 
Turning now to international. Global air cargo capacity remains down 20% year-over-year as of January. And we expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through the end of calendar year 2021. We expect passenger capacity to recover between 55% and 75% of its pre-COVID level by the end of calendar year 2021 with a full recovery not anticipated until '23 or '24. From a demand perspective, APAC outbound has recovered to pre COVID, while Europe outbound is expecting a partial recovery by the end of 2021 and a full recovery sometime in 2023. With these projections, demand trends will continue to favor freighters and integrators. We are confident in our ability to maintain elevated yields for at least 12 months. With e-commerce driving significant growth internationally, we will increasingly utilize peak surcharges in our international business. 
Finally, we are executing commercial strategies to maintain and grow our incremental volume as capacity recovers. Intercontinental performance continues to be very strong. Our total international express yield per pound has again seen impressive double-digit year-over-year improvements in all key markets. Our B2B volumes are recovering to pre-COVID levels in Europe and are fully recovered in Asia, while our overall growth is fueled by significant B2C volumes. 
During our fourth quarter, we will dramatically enhance our European portfolio. As stated on previous calls, with the completion of the road integration last May, our European road value proposition already gained significant improvements. Our customers have been accessing the unparalleled TNT European road network. In Q4, we will introduce an enhanced Europe-to-the-U.S. value proposition, providing an industry-leading next-day service to the U.S. in twice the number of origin countries currently offered. In addition, we will be launching our new FedEx International Priority Express service, giving our European customers 2 premium services within Europe: Offering customers choice between overnight by noon, and overnight by end of day. We will be rolling out these new service capabilities to our customers over the coming months. 
We will also launch FedEx International Connect Plus from Europe to the United States to Asia and within Europe, providing the service across more than 200 lanes. FedEx International Connect Plus, or FICP, has been designed with features of service targeted to reduce the cost to serve while delivering an outstanding customer experience and is specifically targeted to support our e-commerce customers. The new European transportation portfolio is brought to market through a refreshed and modern online shipping application that has already rolled out in Europe and across 143 countries globally. 
In summary, we have great momentum coming out of Q3. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments."
124423,688620421,2239863,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 18, 2021",2021-03-18,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. FedEx delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in February",1226,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. FedEx delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in February. 
Adjusted operating profit increased 120%, and adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points, primarily due to strong volume growth in U.S. domestic residential package; a 41% increase in FedEx international priority package volume, led by Asia and Europe; and solid execution of our revenue management strategies in the face of increasing demand across all our transportation segments. 
These gains were partially offset by 4 noteworthy factors. First, higher variable incentive compensation expense of $485 million, including a $125 million special bonus for global frontline team members at FedEx Express; second, lower revenues and higher costs due to significant weather events that reduced operating income by an estimated $350 million; third, the estimated impact of having 1 fewer operating week day, which was approximately $150 million; and lastly, consolidated direct COVID-19-related cost of approximately $60 million, which does not capture the many accommodations we continue to make across all our operations for the safety of our employees and to comply with various regulations and guidelines. 
Given its significance, I want to add further context around the adverse weather impact. First, we always anticipate and have contingencies for demand and operational impacts during our fiscal third quarter which spans the most active winter weather months. The mid to late February events, in particular, impacted many parts of the country, but were historic throughout the South Central Corridor of the U.S. The snow amounts in Memphis had not been seen in over 50 years prior to the founding of Fedex. And when coupled with a record time 9 consecutive days below freezing, had a significant impact on our operations, as Fred and Raj mentioned. Our Indianapolis and North Texas Express hubs were impacted as well. Demand was deferred as significant portions of the U.S. population were impacted by the various weather events. Of the $350 million estimated impact, $240 million was at Express, $85 million at Ground and $25 million at Freight. Despite that, the Express segment reported adjusted operating profit of $514 million with an adjusted operating margin of 4.8%, up 260 basis points, driven by significant volume growth in both international export and U.S. domestic package as well as higher international priority yields. In the quarter, Express absorbed $340 million higher variable incentive compensation expense and was on pace to deliver record third quarter operating profit prior to the February weather. 
FedEx Ground had an exceptional peak and third quarter, growing operating margin 270 basis points over the prior year to 8.8%. Operating income of $702 million was the highest third quarter in FedEx Ground's history. Yield grew 11%, while volumes were up 25%, resulting in 37% growth in revenues which more than offset headwinds, including increased payments to our independent service providers, higher labor rates and higher variable incentive compensation of $70 million. As Raj and Brie highlighted, our commercial and operational initiatives are yielding and will continue to yield profitable growth at Ground as we capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity. 
Turning to FedEx Freight. Operating income increased 5% despite the impact of increased variable compensation and the weather. Freight continues to post excellent results with their focus on revenue quality, aligning their cost structure with current business levels and improving operational efficiencies. Freight also provided critical peak season operational support to both Ground and Express. 
Our effective tax rate was 15% for the quarter due to tax benefits of $108 million, resulting from a tax rate increase in the Netherlands applied to a deferred tax balances and associated with a $300 million voluntary contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plans. 
Now turning to what's ahead. While there remains a degree of uncertainty as we begin to see progress in combating the pandemic, we are projecting full year adjusted earnings per share of $17.60 to $18.20, compared to $9.50 adjusted EPS in FY '20. We expect our effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market adjustment to be between 21% and 22% for the full year fiscal '21. We expect higher revenue, operating income and operating margins on a year-over-year basis at all our transportation segments in the fourth quarter, which does include 1 additional operating week day. These forecasts assume continued recovery in U.S. industrial production and global trade, no additional COVID-19-related business restrictions and current fuel price expectations. With this forecast, we expect higher variable incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter as we plan to reward our employees for their achievements this year. The year-over-year increase is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, excluding the $125 million special bonus I mentioned previously. 
Earlier, Fred mentioned our sustainability initiatives, and we will record our $100 million pledge to Yale University in our fourth quarter results. For Express, in the fourth quarter, there will be no benefit from the reduction in the aviation excise tax from the CARES Act, which expired on December 31. In addition, Express maintenance costs will be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we execute on our flexible air fleet strategy. Just over a year ago, we shared with you plans to temporarily park the equivalent of 7 MD-11s. Given the increased demand, we are efficiently adding needed capacity for our customers by investing in maintenance expense -- maintenance expense to utilize aircraft from temporary storage. As of now, we plan to have no temporarily parked MD-11s prior to next peak season. This illustrates our ability to flex capacity up or down in a financially efficient manner in response to changes in the market. 
Our capital spending focus remains on strategic investments that will reduce our cost structure, improve our efficiency and increase our capacity to profitably meet market growth demands. Our FY '21 CapEx forecast is now $5.7 billion due to changes in the timing of aircraft payments as well as the acceleration of FedEx Ground capacity initiatives. That projects to roughly 6.9% of expected revenue, which is the lowest level in over 10 years. While we have not finalized our FY '22 plans, capital spending will increase as we invest in capacity and proceed with investments in replacement capital previously deferred. That said, I anticipate CapEx as a percentage of revenue will be 8% or less, which remains less than our historical capital intensity. We will provide more specifics in June. 
Looking at liquidity on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $8.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and on Tuesday, renewed our $2 billion 5-year credit agreement and $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement. The key aspect of our capital allocation strategy moving forward will be strengthening our balance sheet and repayment of outstanding debt. Given our strong cash flows and liquidity position, we are evaluating potential transactions to reduce and refinance existing debt. The timing of any transaction will be based on market conditions, and we would incur costs related to these transactions which may be material. 
I'll close by reiterating I have great confidence in our ability to build on the successes we have had this year as we execute our plans to generate sustainable long-term growth in earnings and cash flow. And with that, we can move to the question-and-answer session."

First of all, in Q4, we expect teens -- margins to be in the teens. But let me speak to how we see the business beyond that. First, we believe there's considerable operating leverage still to be realized in this business. Strategic initiatives will help ensure the right packages are on the right sort, on the right day for on-time delivery. They also ensure that overnight sorts are reserved for next-day volume, enabling the right balance of sort capacity in the network. These are critical capabilities for a 7-day network operation. We're also implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount more closely to volumes, thereby improving dock productivity and our dock expense. And we're rolling out capabilities for certain upstream volume in the network to bypass station sortation and transfer directly to delivery vehicles, freeing up valuable station capacity. None of these initiatives require brick-and-mortar. They're possible through industry leading technology, AI and machine learning and are developed using a safe agile framework and tools. 
So with all of that, in my view, as we continue to transform the FedEx Ground business, FedEx Ground's best days are still ahead of them."

I'll start with the pricing and the yield element and then turn it back over to Don and Mike. From a yield perspective and from a B2B, as we mentioned, as of January, here in the United States, our B2B volume was back to pre-COVID level. The mix within the B2B wasn't what historically we have seen. It was obviously heavy health care, heavy retail, heavy tech. We have not seen it fully come back in automotive and industrial. So we think that there's some upside there. When you look at the B2B volume outside of the United States, at a whole holistic level, we're back, but Europe is not. So we see there still opportunity intra-Europe and intercontinental outbound from Europe. The European team has done a phenomenal job of shoring up volume, but it is B2C volume that they've shored up that gap with. So I still think that there is some B2B upside coming out of Europe still. 
From a yield perspective, we're feeling pretty confident in our yields throughout this calendar year from an International Express as well as a Domestic Express.

One is, I think Raj had mentioned in his prepared remarks about the strength of the quarter. And it was a strong quarter for us, highlighted by the best December we've had in the company's history, and on track to provide that same level of performance for the quarter until the weather hit. Now this is not a comment about would have, should have, could have, but it really is one to highlight the strong fundamentals that exist in the Express business right now. We're extremely confident of the fundamentals that we'll continue to deliver into the fourth quarter as evidence of what we've seen. We had $1.9 billion of revenue growth in that quarter. I thank our excellent sales team around the globe and a wonderful job that the Express operating unit did in terms of monetizing and turning that into a strong performance. 
As it relates to what we're seeing from a yield perspective. I agree, obviously, with Brie's assessment. We're seeing some fundamentals in our international business that are quite clear to us in the short, medium and maybe in the longer term. When inventory levels remain low, supply is soft and demand is very strong. And we think that demand is going to even increase as the stimulus checks come into the marketplace. So we think if you look at it in terms of [ trifecta ], those fundamental economic issues that we have should continue to benefit us, especially in our international business going forward."

We know the spread between the FedEx Ground economy and our FedEx Ground home delivery product. That yield spread, historically, has been too wide. So we are very focused on prioritizing capacity at the higher-yielding home delivery product. And so you're going to see 2 things happen. You're going to see us give more capacity to home delivery at the higher yield, and you're going to see us increase the yield throughout this calendar year, both through peak surcharges as well as through GRI strategies and, quite frankly, just contractual discussion.

But clearly, we have a playbook on margin -- improving margin expansion in both our domestic and international business. I think you touched upon, and I did in my earlier comments about why we're confident over the medium term that the supply and demand curve works in our favor. Capacity is light, and we think it will continue to remain that way. Until people start traveling again on an intercontinental basis, we don't think that happens for the next 12 to 18 months because of the various levels of quarantine restrictions that earn all parts of the globe. 
We're working and monitoring -- I would want to highlight that you didn't talk to as last-mile optimization plans and the impact that, that has on our margin. I think our Chairman says, density is our destiny. And as we can continue to improve the density in the ether of our networks, it's very much margin accretive. We're celebrating the 1-year anniversary coming up on last-mile optimization, working very closely with Henry and his team. And we're driving a significant amount of volume through the Ground network. And that -- those numbers are accelerating on a sequential week-over-week, month-over-month basis. 
So there's a lot of leverage that we can pull in our business, the European transformation, the domestic transformation. We have multiple playbooks in play as we speak to continue with our margin improvement and expansion."

The LMO initiative benefits in 2 ways: One, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network, allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B",487,"Let me add something to that. The LMO initiative benefits in 2 ways: One, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network, allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B and the verticals, particularly those that require ancillary services like SenseAware ID, which is on every single box of vaccines that we're now delivering. I mean, it's almost been flawless, the execution of that. And you can count on your hand the number of issues with the number of vaccines we've delivered in the millions. And so Express is able to be more Express in the B2C and the less dense areas, more cost effectively serve. So it's not just one side. It helps on both sides, which is what Don mentioned about the density, because as we give more residential packages that are not expressed in nature, time definite or something that somebody needs in a residence that Express has to deliver, it helps Ground's density, its cost is asset utilization. 
And I think one of the things that I listen to these calls, the last call, we had 13 questions on Ground margins. I don't know. We're not going to have 13 this time, but we've probably got half a dozen so far, wouldn't that be close? So one of the things that's hard for us to communicate to this group, Henry has mentioned, is the fantastic effect of this technology that we've been rolling out. We don't advertise it all the time, but Rob and his team and some of the fantastic work we have going on in other ways, that's why the confidence level is so high that we can achieve these things in the future. So what you all want us to do is to give it to you in a quarterly forecast and so forth, but some of the numbers that Raj laid out there for you, I mean, they're stunning in the productivity improvements. So I think it's important to look a bit at the bigger picture of some of these things. 
And finally, I'll say, we have a plan to improve Express' margins with a lot of passenger capacity in the marketplace and a plan to improve it without a lot of passenger in the market. It's not an either/or situation. And so those are the 2 recurring questions that come up in these calls. The e-commerce are going to go back because everybody -- the pandemic is over, and your margins aren't going to get better, and you're not going to do well in Express because the passenger is coming back. Those are inherent in most of the questions, these last 2 calls. Both of those are wrong. So I felt I had to step in finally. I've tried not to answer any questions, but you're going down the wrong rabbit hole on both of those areas."

Thanks, and it gives me an opportunity to brag on the team a little bit. So I guess if there's anything that's surprised me and it shouldn't have is how amazing the team is it that provided this exemplary service. Richard Smith and his organization have done Yeoman's work to make sure that these vaccines move through our network. As Fred said, an extremely high level of efficiency, a handful if that shipments that did not meet service. 
I think what's important to note, though, when we talk about the vaccines, is really not the raw in absolute numbers that move in our network. In the grand scheme of things, when you look at almost 20 million packages a day moving through our network, this represents a very small portion of that. But what is important to note is a profound impact that these shipments have when they get to destination. And it really just validates our purpose, and it's one we take very, very seriously. The amount of lives that we potentially save, the amount of people we put back to work, amount of small businesses that reopen, the borders that can reopen back to normal levels. That's really the story on that vaccines, and that's what we're most proud about. 
So I guess, the surprise that really shouldn't have been is the amazing work that our team has done to galvanize and be energized around this purpose. And they take that purpose very personally. Get up every morning thinking about the mission that we have to get these vaccines to market so we can get them in folks on. So I couldn't be more proud of the team in the way that brought these vaccines to market globally. So thanks for asking that question."

But you also tied to it, the technology component, the SenseAware ID that Fred talked about. As we rolled that out last year, I mean, it was perfectly timed for the vaccines to provide unprecedented visibility. And we also launched FedEx Surround last year, which provides the AI and ML predictive capability of what is going to happen. You put it all together, we have the best service possible. And as the Chairman pointed out, extremely low level of failures. So again, we are very proud of this work and continue to do our part in ending this pandemic."

So I think when you think about what we're going -- what we have going on in the fourth quarter, we really actually have 3 kind of expansions from a service perspective. We will have -- actually, we do have the fastest intra-European ground network",403,"Sure. So I think when you think about what we're going -- what we have going on in the fourth quarter, we really actually have 3 kind of expansions from a service perspective. We will have -- actually, we do have the fastest intra-European ground network as we completed the TNT ground network integration. That will provide growth, both from a B2B perspective as well as a B2C perspective. So we are absolutely looking to take share intra Europe, and we see that with the fastest network in Europe. We're confident we can do that. 
When you think about the intercontinental, we actually, today, have the leading value proposition from Europe to the United States, and we're going to double that. So we are going to have a dramatic advantage over both UPS and DHL. We're adding 9 origin countries. So it's going to allow us to really expand both our B2B share as well as our B2C share outside of the major markets in Europe. 
And then third, as we're talking about FICP, the same story outside of the United States is playing out everywhere in the world with more than 85% of our parcel growth opportunity coming in, in e-commerce. And we did not have an international product that really had the right features of service for serving this massive growth opportunity. And we are under-penetrated. Full disclosure, we are behind both DHL and UPS in this market today so we see there only upside. When you think about FICP, its features of service are different from our core B2B products in a couple of ways. Number one, we've changed the clearance capabilities. So we now have low-value clearance capabilities, or what we call type 86, which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities, which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile. And of course, we're rolling out retail access points in Europe as well so that we can provide that access directly to retail, again, lowering the cost to serve. 
So in all 3 of these segments, we believe we've got market share upside, but probably most specifically, on the overnight service to the United States, it's a B2B play. On FICP, it's a rapidly growing opportunity for e-commerce. I hope that helps clarify."

Since our last earnings call, they've completed an historic peak season. And using the power of our expanded 7-day week FedEx Ground operations, our team handled record-breaking volumes throughout the holiday shipping season. They also worked diligently to clear the backlog caused by the recent severe winter weather in the U.S., a 50-year event. They worked night and day to move the backlog quickly and as safely as possible. This includes the many team members who typically perform other duties and volunteered their time to help. We're sincerely grateful to them and to our customers for their understanding as we navigated the effects of these massive winter storms.  
Our team members are continuing to move the world forward with the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines-related ingredients and supplies throughout the U.S., Canada and more than 20 other countries around the world. We did a great job on these vaccines during the weather event, too. FedEx is prepared to transport now vaccines to more than 220 countries and territories for as long as necessary to help eradicate COVID-19.  
As part of our responsibility to be good stewards of the planet, earlier this month, we announced our bold strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040. To help reach this goal, we focused our strategy in 3 key areas: vehicle electrification, which we've been involved in for over a decade; sustainable energy; and carbon sequestration -- natural carbon sequestration. In this regard, importantly, our plan includes a pledge to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. The center will build on the Yale legacy of the school and the environment of world-class research and education to develop measurable carbon capture solutions with an initial focus on helping to offset greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline emissions. Findings will be published and shared so that businesses, industries and governments globally can benefit from this work.  
As reflected in this quarter's results, continued execution of our strategies is producing strong earnings growth and margin improvement across our company. We expect demand for our unmatched e-commerce and international express solutions to remain high for the foreseeable future.  
I'm exceedingly optimistic about the future of FedEx, and again, very grateful to our team members for their hard work. I'd also like to thank Henry Maier, President and CEO of FedEx Ground, who is retiring at the end of July after more than 35 years of dedicated service at FedEx. We'll have much more to say about Henry on our next earnings call in June.  
Let me now ask Raj, Brie and Mike to provide their comments, after which we will take your questions. Raj?"

Despite challenging circumstances, the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our company's history. This included delivering nearly 0.5 billion holiday packages, transporting the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines here in the U.S. and increasing collaboration across operating companies.  
Our results speak for themselves. In December, we achieved the highest monthly totals in our company's history in both revenue and operating profit. Results in December were different than previous years. We better maximized our available capacity and, as Brie will cover in a moment, better aligned prices to incremental costs. Peak 2020 was unlike any peak experience before and sets a new standard for future peak seasons.  
As Fred mentioned, our operations were impacted by last month's severe winter weather throughout the United States. Mike will expand more on the scope and unique nature of these storms. And I'm sure many of you have seen reports in the last couple of days, which illustrate the impact these storms had on the overall U.S. economy, including retail sales and manufacturing output. We implemented numerous contingencies to mitigate the impact, including adding sorts, line haul and collaborating across our network to assist in the recovery. I'm very proud of the team for managing through this very challenging situation.  
Now speaking of the team, we announced that Henry Maier will retire this summer and named John Smith, former President and CEO of FedEx Freight, his successor. Lance Moll, former SVP of Operations at FedEx Freight, has been promoted to CEO, and we're pleased to have all these 3 gentlemen on the call today.  
Now turning to FedEx Ground. The outstanding margin improvement for Ground in Q3 highlights the success of our ongoing strategic initiatives and investments to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with the last mile even amid record residential volume levels. These investments continue to pay off. 
Let me share 3 examples. Number one, we saw a meaningful improvement in last-mile efficiency as service providers improve their stops per hour 21% year-over-year in Q3. Number two, the average cost per stop decreased by 12% year-over-year. And number three, we maximized our assets, expanding to 7-day operations and integrating Ground Economy, or formerly FedEx SmartPost, reduced our fixed cost per package by 4% year-over-year. We remain very optimistic for continued profitable growth at Ground.  
Collaboration between operating companies continue at an unprecedented rate in Q3. This month marks the 1-year anniversary of the launch of last-mile optimization, which allows us to flex our networks to increase delivery density for residential, rural and deferred packages. LMO will expand to 6 more markets effective May 1, increasing to 63 markets in total and covering 2/3 of the U.S. GDP. Additionally, FedEx Freight has delivered more than 1.75 million shipments for Ground so far this fiscal year. This time last year, Freight had yet to deliver a single Ground shipment as increased support for Ground kicked off in May of 2020.  
Finally, turning to FedEx Express. Our global network is moving COVID-19 vaccines, ingredients and supplies as we speak. It has been a coordinated orchestration of our physical and digital capabilities. At FedEx Express, we expect elevated pricing for at least the next 12 months. We know, however, that these prices are not sustainable in the longer term, and we will flex our networks appropriately as commercial capacity returns into the market. In addition, we will continue to improve our efficiency by executing last-mile optimization and transforming our European business.  
In Europe, momentum continues with the physical integration of the TNT network. We recently announced our Europe restructuring program, and we are progressing with local consultations as planned and in accordance with local market regulations. April will be a big month as we prepare to roll out a set of new service capabilities for our customers, which Brie will provide more detail very shortly here. We'll complete their integration in spring 2022, which will bring the physical network integration to a close. Our Paris hub will be our main Express hub in Europe with Liege serving as [indiscernible] in the U.S. as our second largest European air hub. We remain focused on optimizing the network and strengthening our capabilities to drive upside in Europe for years to come.  
In closing, FedEx remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. We have the network, the strategy and the right team in place as we build upon the exceptional results we have seen so far in fiscal year '21. With that, let me turn it over to Brie."
124423,688620421,2239891,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 18, 2021",2021-03-18,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In the United States, we are seeing strong growth and momentum. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, with e-commerce contributing 86% of total U.",852,"Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In the United States, we are seeing strong growth and momentum. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, with e-commerce contributing 86% of total U.S. market growth. E-commerce as a percentage of U.S. retail sales was approximately 21% in Q4 of calendar year '20, significantly above the pre-pandemic level.  
We remain excited about the diversification and evolution of the e-commerce market. Some of our largest retail customers reported e-commerce growth rates in the high double and even triple digits through 2020. As the U.S. reopens, we recognize the potential for a short-term deceleration in e-commerce shopping. However, we are very confident that e-commerce, as a percentage of retail, has a long growth runway.  
Turning now to peak. It certainly was the shipathon we predicted, a peak upon a peak. We had tremendous growth with almost 500 million packages delivered and 19% year-over-year ADV growth. To the global sales and marketing teams, I could not be more proud of your execution and the momentum you have created.  
FY '21 parcel volume growth remains strong, supported by a portfolio of e-commerce solutions growing at double digits. Of particular note, our FedEx Ground 7-day-a-week residential delivery service is one of the fastest-growing services in e-commerce with 70% volume growth in Q3. Overall, year-to-date average daily volume growth remains strong for all customer segments. However, our U.S. small and medium segment grew 35% through the end of February.  
In FY '21 Q3, FedEx total U.S. domestic residential package volume mix was 70% versus 62% a year ago. With the increase of residential packages in our networks, we're focused on improving yield and product mix. In FY '21 Q3, we increased FedEx Ground Economy yield by 35% and overall U.S. domestic residential yields by 15% year-over-year. It's important to note FedEx Ground is formerly FedEx SmartPost. While e-commerce is the key driver of the overall growth, in January, our U.S. enterprise B2B volume was at pre-COVID levels.  
Turning to our U.S. revenue quality strategy. We continue to actively pursue yield management, product and customer mix strategies. Our primary focus is ensuring large customer pricing aligns to their volume distribution. We continue to manage capacity at FedEx Ground, prioritizing our highest yielding SAM segment as well as our premium home delivery product. As we plan for peak of fiscal year '22, our peak surcharges will continue to play a critical role.  
Turning now to international. Global air cargo capacity remains down 20% year-over-year as of January. And we expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through the end of calendar year 2021. We expect passenger capacity to recover between 55% and 75% of its pre-COVID level by the end of calendar year 2021 with a full recovery not anticipated until '23 or '24.  
From a demand perspective, APAC outbound has recovered to pre COVID, while Europe outbound is expecting a partial recovery by the end of 2021 and a full recovery sometime in 2023. With these projections, demand trends will continue to favor freighters and integrators. We are confident in our ability to maintain elevated yields for at least 12 months. With e-commerce driving significant growth internationally, we will increasingly utilize peak surcharges in our international business. Finally, we are executing commercial strategies to maintain and grow our incremental volume as capacity recovers. Intercontinental performance continues to be very strong. Our total international express yield per pound has again seen impressive double-digit year-over-year improvements in all key markets. Our B2B volumes are recovering to pre-COVID levels in Europe and are fully recovered in Asia, while our overall growth is fueled by significant B2C volumes.  
During our fourth quarter, we will dramatically enhance our European portfolio. As stated on previous calls, with the completion of the road integration last May, our European road value proposition already gained significant improvements. Our customers have been accessing the unparalleled TNT European road network. In Q4, we will introduce an enhanced Europe-to-the-U.S. value proposition, providing an industry-leading next-day service to the U.S. in twice the number of origin countries currently offered. In addition, we will be launching our new FedEx International Priority Express service, giving our European customers 2 premium services within Europe, offering customers choice between overnight by noon and overnight by end of day. We will be rolling out these new service capabilities to our customers over the coming months.  
We will also launch FedEx International Connect Plus from Europe to the United States to Asia and within Europe, providing the service across more than 200 lanes. FedEx International Connect Plus, or FICP, has been designed with features of service targeted to reduce the cost to serve while delivering an outstanding customer experience and is specifically targeted to support our e-commerce customers. The new European transportation portfolio is brought to market through a refreshed and modern online shipping application that has already rolled out in Europe and across 143 countries globally. In summary, we have great momentum coming out of Q3. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments."
124423,688620421,2239891,"FedEx Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 18, 2021",2021-03-18,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. FedEx delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in February",1223,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. FedEx delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in February.  
Adjusted operating profit increased 120% and adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points, primarily due to strong volume growth in U.S. domestic residential package, a 41% increase in FedEx International Priority package volume, led by Asia and Europe; and solid execution of our revenue management strategies in the face of increasing demand across all our transportation segments. These gains were partially offset by 4 noteworthy factors. First, higher variable incentive compensation expense of $485 million, including a $125 million special bonus for global frontline team members at FedEx Express; second, lower revenues and higher costs due to significant weather events that reduced operating income by an estimated $350 million; third, the estimated impact of having 1 fewer operating week day, which was approximately $150 million; and lastly, consolidated direct COVID-19-related cost of approximately $60 million, which does not capture the many accommodations we continue to make across all our operations for the safety of our employees and to comply with various regulations and guidelines.  
Given its significance, I want to add further context around the adverse weather impact. First, we always anticipate and have contingencies for demand and operational impacts during our fiscal third quarter, which spans the most active winter weather months. The mid to late February events, in particular, impacted many parts of the country, but were historic throughout the South Central Corridor of the U.S. The snow amounts in Memphis had not been seen in over 50 years prior to the founding of FedEx and, when coupled with a record time 9 consecutive days below freezing, had a significant impact on our operations, as Fred and Raj mentioned. 
Our Indianapolis and North Texas Express hubs were impacted as well. Demand was deferred as significant portions of the U.S. population were impacted by the various weather events. Of the $350 million estimated impact, $240 million was at Express, $85 million at Ground and $25 million at Freight. Despite that, the Express segment reported adjusted operating profit of $514 million with an adjusted operating margin of 4.8%, up 260 basis points, driven by significant volume growth in both international export and U.S. domestic package as well as higher international priority yields. In the quarter, Express absorbed $340 million higher variable incentive compensation expense and was on pace to deliver record third quarter operating profit prior to the February weather.  
FedEx Ground had an exceptional peak and third quarter, growing operating margin 270 basis points over the prior year to 8.8%. Operating income of $702 million was the highest third quarter in FedEx Ground's history. Yield grew 11%, while volumes were up 25%, resulting in 37% growth in revenues, which more than offset headwinds, including increased payments to our independent service providers, higher labor rates and higher variable incentive compensation of $70 million. As Raj and Brie highlighted, our commercial and operational initiatives are yielding and will continue to yield profitable growth at Ground as we capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity.  
Turning to FedEx Freight. Operating income increased 5% despite the impact of increased variable compensation and the weather. Freight continues to post excellent results with their focus on revenue quality, aligning their cost structure with current business levels and improving operational efficiencies. Freight also provided critical peak season operational support to both Ground and Express.  
Our effective tax rate was 15% for the quarter due to tax benefits of $108 million, resulting from a tax rate increase in the Netherlands applied to a deferred tax balances and associated with a $300 million voluntary contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plans.  
Now turning to what's ahead. While there remains a degree of uncertainty as we begin to see progress in combating the pandemic, we are projecting full year adjusted earnings per share of $17.60 to $18.20 compared to $9.50 adjusted EPS in FY '20. We expect our effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market adjustment to be between 21% and 22% for the full year fiscal '21. We expect higher revenue, operating income and operating margins on a year-over-year basis at all our transportation segments in the fourth quarter, which does include 1 additional operating week day. These forecasts assume continued recovery in U.S. industrial production and global trade, no additional COVID-19-related business restrictions and current fuel price expectations. With this forecast, we expect higher variable incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter as we plan to reward our employees for their achievements this year. The year-over-year increase is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, excluding the $125 million special bonus I mentioned previously.  
Earlier, Fred mentioned our sustainability initiatives, and we will record our $100 million pledge to Yale University in our fourth quarter results. For Express, in the fourth quarter, there will be no benefit from the reduction in the aviation excise tax from the CARES Act, which expired on December 31. In addition, Express maintenance costs will be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we execute on our flexible air fleet strategy. Just over a year ago, we shared with you plans to temporarily park the equivalent of 7 MD-11s. Given the increased demand, we are efficiently adding needed capacity for our customers by investing in maintenance expense to utilize aircraft from temporary storage. As of now, we plan to have no temporarily parked MD-11s prior to next peak season. This illustrates our ability to flex capacity up or down in a financially efficient manner in response to changes in the market.  
Our capital spending focus remains on strategic investments that will reduce our cost structure, improve our efficiency and increase our capacity to profitably meet market growth demands. Our FY '21 CapEx forecast is now $5.7 billion due to changes in the timing of aircraft payments as well as the acceleration of FedEx Ground capacity initiatives. That projects to roughly 6.9% of expected revenue, which is the lowest level in over 10 years. While we have not finalized our FY '22 plans, capital spending will increase as we invest in capacity and proceed with investments in replacement capital previously deferred. That said, I anticipate CapEx as a percentage of revenue will be 8% or less, which remains less than our historical capital intensity. We will provide more specifics in June. 
Looking at liquidity on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $8.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and on Tuesday, renewed our $2 billion 5-year credit agreement and $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement. The key aspect of our capital allocation strategy moving forward will be strengthening our balance sheet and repayment of outstanding debt. Given our strong cash flows and liquidity position, we are evaluating potential transactions to reduce and refinance existing debt. The timing of any transaction will be based on market conditions, and we would incur costs related to these transactions which may be material. 
I'll close by reiterating I have great confidence in our ability to build on the successes we have had this year as we execute our plans to generate sustainable long-term growth in earnings and cash flow. And with that, we can move to the question-and-answer session."

You're going to see that shift throughout this year as capacity -- we anticipate capacity throughout this calendar year will be constrained. And as a result, as I mentioned, we've got to prioritize our SAM growth. You heard 35%. It's the best segment performance we've got from a small perspective. So we're going to prioritize that. It will continue to work our yields up. In addition to that, the FedEx Economy product is something that we are very focused on, and it will add dramatic yield upside from here out. Henry?"

First of all, in Q4, we expect teens to -- margins to be in the teens. But let me speak to how we see the business beyond that. First, we believe there's considerable operating leverage still to be realized in this business. Strategic initiatives will help ensure the right packages are on the right sort, on the right day for on-time delivery. They also ensure that overnight sorts are reserved for next-day volume, enabling the right balance of sort capacity in the network. These are critical capabilities for a 7-day network operation. We're also implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount more closely to volumes, thereby improving dock productivity and our dock expense. And we're rolling out capabilities for certain upstream volume in the network to bypass station sortation and transfer directly to delivery vehicles, freeing up valuable station capacity. None of these initiatives require brick-and-mortar. They're possible through industry leading technology, AI and machine learning and are developed using a safe agile framework and tools. 
So with all of that, in my view, as we continue to transform the FedEx Ground business, FedEx Ground's best days are still ahead of them."

I'll start with the pricing and the yield element and then turn it back over to Don and Mike. From a yield perspective and from a B2B, as we mentioned, as of January, here in the United States, our B2B volume was back to pre-COVID level. The mix within the B2B wasn't what historically we have seen. It was obviously heavy health care, heavy retail, heavy tech. We have not seen it fully come back in automotive and industrial. So we think that there's some upside there. When you look at the B2B volume outside of the United States, at a whole holistic level, we're back, but Europe is not. So we see there still opportunity intra-Europe and intercontinental outbound from Europe. The European team has done a phenomenal job of shoring up volume, but it is B2C volume that they've shored up that gap with. So I still think that there is some B2B upside coming out of Europe still. 
From a yield perspective, we're feeling pretty confident in our yields throughout this calendar year from an international express as well as a domestic express. There is pressure on the yield from a weight perspective because the e-commerce mix will continue to increase outside of the United States at Express. So overall, we're quite comfortable from a yield growth and opportunity perspective for the next 12 months. And I'll turn it over to Mike."

Now this is not a comment about would have, should have, could have, but it really is one to highlight the strong fundamentals that exist in the Express business right now. We're extremely confident of the fundamentals that we'll continue to deliver into the fourth quarter as evidence of what we've seen. We had $1.9 billion of revenue growth in that quarter. I thank our excellent sales team around the globe and the wonderful job that the Express operating unit did in terms of monetizing and turning that into a strong performance. 
And as it relates to what we're seeing from a yield perspective, I agree, obviously, with Brie's assessment. We're seeing some fundamentals in our international business that are quite clear to us in the short, medium and maybe in the longer term. When inventory levels remain low, supply is soft and demand is very strong. And we think that demand is going to even increase as the stimulus checks come into the marketplace. So we think if you look at it in terms of a trifecta, those fundamental economic issues that we have should continue to benefit us, especially in our international business going forward."

And presumably, that's out very quickly and that you retain a portion of it. I wanted to see if you could give us a sense of the potential offset from your cost initiatives. Those numbers, if you look at a couple of years, are they potentially in the same magnitude? And I'm thinking in particular of integration of some of the B2C shipments for Express and Ground, but that's helpful on the cost side and potentially TNT and maybe you have other things in mind."

Obviously, it's not possible to give out the numbers by the individual items that you just talked about. However, we -- let me address it broadly by first saying that the capacity in the commercial carrier -- passenger carriers, we don't expect it to come back in the next 12 months, maybe more, and we expect the premium to remain for that period of time. Even if it does come back, we have the opportunity to flex it, flex our networks. We can -- and that is -- we have demonstrated that capability to flex up. And we'll be able to flex it down as needed and they become our partner networks to move deferred traffic. Thirdly, there's a lot of activity that's going on to continue to improve margins in FedEx Express. Transformation in Europe was one, expansion of last-mile optimization is another and very solid activity. So we feel very confident about our future of our Express around the world. I don't know, Don, if you want to add anything more to that?"

But clearly, we have a playbook on margin -- improving margin expansion in both our domestic and international business. I think you touched upon it. I did in my earlier comments about why we're confident over the medium term that the supply and demand curve works in our favor. Capacity is light, and we think it will continue to remain that way. Until people start traveling again on an intercontinental basis, we don't think that happens for the next 12 to 18 months because of the various levels of quarantine restrictions that earn all parts of the globe. 
We're working and monitoring -- I would want to highlight that you didn't talk to was our last-mile optimization plans and the impact that, that has on our margin. I think our Chairman says, density is our destiny. And as we can continue to improve the density in the ether of our networks, it's very much margin accretive. We're celebrating the 1-year anniversary coming up on last-mile optimization, working very closely with Henry and his team. And we're driving a significant amount of volume through the Ground network. And that -- those numbers are accelerating on a sequential week-over-week, month-over-month basis. 
So there's a lot of leverage that we can pull in our business, the European transformation, the domestic transformation. We have multiple playbooks in play as we speak to continue with our margin improvement and expansion."

The LMO initiative benefits in 2 ways: one, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network, allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B",487,"Let me add something to that. The LMO initiative benefits in 2 ways: one, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network, allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B and the verticals, particularly those that require ancillary services like SenseAware ID, which is on every single box of vaccines that we're now delivering. I mean it's almost been flawless, the execution of that. And you can count on your hand the number of issues with the number of vaccines we've delivered in the millions. And so Express is able to be more Express in the B2C and the less dense areas, more cost effectively serve. So it's not just one side. It helps on both sides, which is what Don mentioned about the density, because as we get more residential packages that are not express in nature, time definite or something that somebody needs in a residence that Express has to deliver, it helps Ground's density, its cost, its asset utilization. 
And I think one of the things that I listen to these calls, the last call, we had 13 questions on Ground margins. I don't know. We're not going to have 13 this time, but we've probably got half a dozen so far, wouldn't that be close? So one of the things that's hard for us to communicate to this group, Henry has mentioned, is the fantastic effect of this technology that we've been rolling out. We don't advertise it all the time, but Rob and his team and some of the fantastic work we have going on in other ways, that's why the confidence level is so high that we can achieve these things in the future. So what you all want us to do is to give it to you in a quarterly forecast and so forth, but some of the numbers that Raj laid out there for you, I mean, they're stunning in the productivity improvements. So I think it's important to look a bit at the bigger picture of some of these things. 
And finally, I'll say, we have a plan to improve Express margins with a lot of passenger capacity in the marketplace and a plan to improve it without a lot of passenger in the market. It's not an either/or situation. And so those are the 2 recurring questions that come up in these calls. The e-commerce are going to go back because everybody -- the pandemic is over, and your margins aren't going to get better, and you're not going to do well in Express because the passenger is coming back. Those are inherent in most of the questions, these last 2 calls. Both of those are wrong. So I felt I had to step in finally. I've tried not to answer any questions, but you're going down the wrong rabbit hole on both of those areas."

Thanks, and it gives me an opportunity to brag on the team a little bit. So I guess if there's anything that's surprised me and it shouldn't have is how amazing the team is it that provided this exemplary service. Richard Smith and his organization have done [indiscernible] work to make sure that these vaccines move through our network. As Fred said, an extremely high level of efficiency, a handful if that shipments that did not meet service. 
I think what's important to note, though, when we talk about the vaccines, is really not the raw in absolute numbers that move in our network. In the grand scheme of things, when you look at almost 20 million packages a day moving through our network, this represents a very small portion of that. But what is important to note is a profound impact that these shipments have when they get to destination. And it really just validates our purpose, and it's one we take very, very seriously. The amount of lives that we potentially save, the amount of people we put back to work, the amount of small businesses that reopen, the borders that can reopen back to normal levels. That's really the story on that vaccines, and that's what we're most proud about. 
So I guess the surprise that really shouldn't have been is the amazing work that our team has done to galvanize and be energized around this purpose. And they take that purpose very personally. Get up every morning thinking about the mission that we have to get these vaccines to market so we can get them in folks's arms. So I couldn't be more proud of the team in the way that brought these vaccines to market globally. So thanks for asking that question."

But you also tied to it, the technology component, the SenseAware ID that Fred talked about that we rolled that out last year, I mean, it was perfectly timed for the vaccines to provide unprecedented visibility. And we also launched FedEx Surround last year, which provides the AI and ML predictive capability of what is going to happen. You put it all together, we have the best service possible.

So I think when you think about what we're going -- what we have going on in the fourth quarter, we really actually have 3 kind of expansions from a service perspective. We will have -- actually, we do have the fastest intra-European ground network",402,"Sure. So I think when you think about what we're going -- what we have going on in the fourth quarter, we really actually have 3 kind of expansions from a service perspective. We will have -- actually, we do have the fastest intra-European ground network as we completed the TNT ground network integration. That will provide growth, both from a B2B perspective as well as a B2C perspective. So we are absolutely looking to take share intra-Europe, and we see that with the fastest network in Europe. We're confident we can do that. 
When you think about the intercontinental, we actually, today, have the leading value proposition from Europe to the United States, and we're going to double that. So we are going to have a dramatic advantage over both UPS and DHL. We're adding 9 origin countries. So it's going to allow us to really expand both our B2B share as well as our B2C share outside of the major markets in Europe. 
And then third, as we're talking about FICP, the same story outside of the United States is playing out everywhere in the world with more than 85% of our parcel growth opportunity coming in, in e-commerce. And we did not have an international product that really had the right features of service for serving this massive growth opportunity. And we are under-penetrated. Full disclosure, we are behind both DHL and UPS in this market today so we see there only upside. 
When you think about FICP, its features of service are different from our core B2B products in a couple of ways. Number one, we've changed the clearance capabilities. So we now have low-value clearance capabilities, or what we call type 86, which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities, which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile. And of course, we're rolling out retail access points in Europe as well so that we can provide that access directly to retail, again, lowering the cost to serve. 
So in all 3 of these segments, we believe we've got market share upside. But probably most specifically, on the overnight service to the United States, it's a B2B play. On FICP, it's a rapidly growing opportunity for e-commerce. I hope that helps clarify."

Fiscal '21 was truly unprecedented, and we are enormously proud of our 570,000 team members who performed magnificently to keep global health care, industrial and at-home supply chains open and, more recently, allowed significant additional commerce to flow. The FedEx team's role in moving PPE, vaccines and international release shipments has been perhaps this company's finest hour. Our financial results speak for themselves. Raj and Mike will have more to say about the numbers, of course. 
Our pride in the FedEx team and our performance for shareholders is greatly tempered, however, by our continuing grief over the April 15 [indiscernible] murder at the FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis of 8 FedEx team members. Lingering sorrow among their families, friends and colleagues throughout FedEx can never be erased. Raj will also comment on this strategy in a moment. 
The strategies we've executed over the last several years were carefully developed and have been executed at a high level with great success overall. As we've mentioned previously, the pandemic simply brought many of the market trends, which informed our strategies forward. Brie will be more specific about these trends in a moment. 
As reported, FedEx revenues for FY '21 were $84 billion, and we project FY '22 revenues over $90 billion. We believe FedEx margins will continue to improve this fiscal year. However, as Raj will cover momentarily, the labor market in the U.S. over the last several months has been quite challenging, adversely affecting hiring and leading to significant reengineering of parts of our networks to deal with the lack of these resources. And while the situation has begun to abate, delivering a successful peak season when we anticipate significant year-over-year volume increases will require additional flexibility and creativity on the part of our management, staff and frontline team members while maintaining our safety above all culture. 
To handle future Ground volumes, we are significantly increasing capacity to deliver both great service and improved financial results. This summer, we are intently focused on improving network and delivery operations prior to the volume surge in the fall. There's great focus on revenue quality at FedEx. However, our focus solely on yields does not give a complete picture of our profit upside. As Brie will explain, our alliances with retailer partners generate significant amounts of short-haul traffic, much of which is now shipped from stores. 
Our innovate digitally initiatives are gaining steam, particularly Surround and SenseAware. Let me thank Henry Maier for more than 34 years of loyal and dedicated service to FedEx and RPS, which we acquired in 1998. At the conclusion of this call, I'll have additional comments about Henry's remarkable career and countless contributions to FedEx' growth and success. 
A further note, the Biden administration has recognized an exceptional talent, and our Board member, [indiscernible], who was confirmed by the Senate last week, to serve as the National Cyber Director.

As Fred stated, we continue to man the tragic loss of 8 team members killed at FedEx Ground facilities in Indianapolis on April 15. Let me take a moment to remember each team member we lost that day: Matthew R. Alexander; Samaria Blackwell; Amarjeet Johal; Jaswinder Kaur; Amarjit Sekhon; Jaswinder Singh; Karli Smith; and John Weisert. Our most heartfelt sympathies and condolences remain with the families, team members and friends of these individuals. They will forever be members of the FedEx family. 
Now turning to our results. Fiscal year '21 was a pivotal year for FedEx as we delivered incredible financial performance, including record revenue and profit in Q4 and for the full fiscal year. This is a no short measure due to the outstanding work by our global team members. Let me take this opportunity to say thank you to the FedEx team, especially those on the front lines, for going above and beyond the call of duty in these difficult times. When I look back at fiscal year '21, I'm proud of the role FedEx played in saving lives, helping small and medium businesses get back on their feet and keeping the globe connected. 
The exceptional financial performance was driven by our robust growth strategy and focused execution on 3 key areas: e-commerce, operational excellence and digital innovation. Let me take a moment to highlight each strategic focus area and the progress made in Q4. 
Firstly, e-commerce. The acceleration of trends experienced in fiscal year '21 highlight the importance of our ongoing strategic initiatives to win globally in e-commerce. This includes FedEx Ground 7-day operations, investing in technology to optimize last-mile deliveries, expanding capabilities to better handle large items, offering the first FedEx branded through-the-door service with FedEx Freight Direct and accelerating the expansion of our retail convenience network. Ground's full 7-day operations, including weekend residential delivery coverage that reaches 98% of the U.S. population on Saturdays and 95% on Sundays, give us a distinct competitive advantage. We are working very closely with customers to leverage the full flexibility of weekend operations so they can meet the demands of e-commerce every day of the week. This is evident in the growth we saw in Ground Sunday deliveries with 56% more packages delivered on Sunday in Q4 than last year. We are also winning in e-commerce outside the United States by leveraging the strength of our global networks and the expansion of our portfolio. Brie will cover additional details in this regard shortly. 
The second strategic focus area is operational excellence. Our competitive advantage in the marketplace is fueled by a relentless focus on operational excellence and customer service. While service is a hallmark of FedEx, like many businesses, we are facing challenges with labor availability, which have contributed to recent service levels that do not meet our own high expectations of the quality we expect to deliver to our customers. The inability to hire team members, particularly package handlers, has driven wage rates higher and create inefficiency in our networks as we use over time to cover open shifts and route volume around known constraints just as a few examples. As such, we're taking bold actions across the business to address service issues and prepare for sustained volume increases, including continued investments in people, capacity and technology to optimize our networks. FedEx Ground's strategic focus on efficiency continued to reap benefits in Q4, as seen in our ongoing improvements in density. These improvements are driven in part by both B2B and B2C volume growth as well as enhancements in route optimization technology, which draw up the average number of stops the service providers made per hour by 3.6% versus Q4 of the previous fiscal year. Along with the revised service provider e-commerce rate structure, these efficiencies contributed to a 3% reduction in cost per stop compared to the same quarter last year. Further collaboration to improve efficiency continued across our businesses as we expanded our last-mile optimization program. In addition, FedEx Freight provided approximately 70 million line-haul miles and delivered 1.75 million packages for ground in fiscal year '21. 
Another significant opportunity in further enhancing our operational excellence is the improvement and the profitability of our international operations, which starts in Europe, with the completion of the physical integration of TNT. While the TNT integration has seen its share of setbacks, including a 2017 cyberattack and the delays due to the pandemic, we are certain of the value this combination creates for the FedEx of the future. The European restructuring announced in January 2021 is set to deliver $275 million to $350 million in benefits on an annual basis starting in fiscal 2024. The cost of the severance benefits under this program, which will be incurred through fiscal 2023, will be in the range from $300 million to $575 million in cash expenditures.
In Q4, we introduced overnight service from Europe, connecting 90% of European businesses to major U.S. markets. It's an unparalleled next-day connectivity that nobody in the marketplace matches. As you can see, we continue to enhance value for our customers while restructuring our European business. Said simply, the upside in the profitability of our international business is tremendous. 
Finally, our third strategic focus area, digital innovation. We are reimagining our digital capabilities and infrastructure in a manner that will deliver market-leading customer experiences that are simple, personal and proactive. We made great strides in fiscal 2021 as we continue to drive new value through strategic technologies, including increasing capabilities and products through sensor-based technologies like FedEx SenseAware ID and FedEx Surround, which provide unmatched visibility and predictive capabilities, most notably seen during the transportation of life-saving COVID-19 vaccines, building of sharp runner integration and Adobe, Magento extension to enable a more open e-commerce ecosystem and furthering development of our portfolio of services in the autonomous vehicle space as illustrated with ongoing Roxo testing in this month's announcement of testing with [indiscernible]. 
In fiscal 2022, we'll continue to deliver on our strategy around e-commerce, operational excellence and digital innovation as we execute on the following key initiatives. First, we expect to substantially increase capacity for this peak by investing in FedEx Ground's infrastructure with the addition of 16 new automated facilities and the implementation of nearly 100 expansion projects at existing operations and key technological enhancements. Second, we will complete the air network integration in early calendar year 2022, which will bring the physical TNT network integration to a close and provides the inflection point for long-term profit improvement in Europe. Next, we are exercising existing options to purchase 20 additional 767Fs, 10 for delivery in fiscal year '24 and 10 for delivery in fiscal year '25, as we continue to modernize our fleet and improve service to our customers. And we finally continue to identify areas to adapt, collaborate and utilize different elements of our global network to increase efficiency and reduce cost to serve. Our networks and capabilities reflect decades of investment, innovation and expertise that are differentiated from our competition. It's incredibly difficult to replicate and provides a significant advantage over others in our industry. 
When we net it all back together, despite some of the cyclical factors, we remain very confident for fiscal year '22 and beyond. The e-commerce market will continue to be a growth engine globally. And if anything has become clear over the past year, it's the contribution of our industry provides to the e-commerce value chain. We remain focused on differentiation, building customer solutions and improving revenue quality as critical long-term levers of profitable growth. In addition, the transformation efforts in Europe and U.S. domestic will generate margin improvement opportunities. And finally, we're just getting started on unlocking value with digital innovation. 
Our robust growth strategy positions FedEx to deliver superior, sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. 
With that, I will turn it over to Brie."
124423,688620452,2327305,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2021",2021-06-24,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In a year of extraordinary challenges and change for our business, I continue to be immensely proud of the team's ability to execute our commercial strategy while developing solutions to help our customers grow th",989,"Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In a year of extraordinary challenges and change for our business, I continue to be immensely proud of the team's ability to execute our commercial strategy while developing solutions to help our customers grow their businesses. Before I move into fiscal year '22, I wanted to reflect on our truly exceptional results of '21. 
Fiscal year '21 parcel volume was very strong across our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. Average daily volume grew across all our customer segments, with U.S. small and medium leading the way of 32% year-over-year growth. E-commerce also drove 28% year-over-year growth in our returns business through April. As more consumers shopped online, enrolled FedEx delivery manager users grew by 43% year-over-year. With this backdrop and the momentum from fiscal '21, our fiscal '22 outlook calls for robust growth. 
Enterprise growth in fiscal year '22 will be primarily driven by U.S. domestic e-commerce growth, followed by strength in B2B and international and a focus on revenue quality. In the United States, the flourishing U.S. domestic parcel market will continue to provide opportunity in the coming years. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to surpass 107 million packages a day in calendar year '22, with e-commerce contributing 88% of total U.S. market growth. Excluding Amazon volume, the U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to be 72 million packages a day in calendar year '22. As we look beyond calendar year '22, we forecast that the U.S. domestic parcel market will reach 172 million packages a day in calendar year 2026. 
In fiscal year '21, FedEx total U.S. domestic residential package volume mix was 67% versus 62% a year ago. As we look beyond this fiscal year, we expect residential volumes to grow significantly faster than commercial volume. However, with retail inventories relative to sales at historic lows, we expect solid B2B volume growth this fiscal year. 
In fiscal year '22, we will continue to execute against our revenue quality strategy. In fiscal year '21 Q4, we increased FedEx Ground economy yields by 28%, and overall, U.S. domestic residential yields by 16% year-over-year. It is important to note when reviewing composite U.S. domestic yields, that weights and zone will decrease, putting pressure on yields as we grow in e-commerce. We are managing total network profitability. Short zone e-commerce and our FedEx Ground economy service will enable us to sweat our assets and maximize sortation capacity. 
Within our pricing strategy, we continue to prioritize capacity for commercial and small and medium customer segments. To support the network amid ongoing capacity constraints, we have increased our peak surcharges as of June 21, and we'll monitor and adjust our strategy as capacity and demand warrant. 
We will continue to confidently renegotiate our large customer segment contracts to increase profitability. This means balancing product, day of week and lane mix at the customer level while ensuring appropriate surcharges and rate increases cover rising labor costs. Most large customer contracts in the U.S. are 3 years. Almost half of our total large segment volume had pricing agreement implementations in the past 12 months, leaving upside for fiscal year '22. 
Now turning to international. Global trade volume has surpassed prepandemic levels and is on course for its fastest year of growth in over a decade. Global air cargo capacity remained down 10% year-over-year as of April, mainly due to the reduction in passenger [ available ] capacity. We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year '22. Recovery will be slow, potentially episodic, and a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. We believe a favorable pricing internationally should continue through fiscal year 2022. We will continue to manage demand internationally, using yield management and continuation of peak surcharges, especially on transpacific and transatlantic lanes. We are seeing a very good capture rate on these surcharges. 
While peak surcharges played a significant role in our international performance in fiscal year '21, it was not the majority of our revenue growth. In fiscal '21, we improved parcel and priority mix versus freight and economy, grew our small and medium customer base while penetrating e-commerce. In fact, we grew e-commerce parcel volume by more than $1 billion year-over-year out of Asia and Europe. To a large extent, due to its lightweight nature and limited relative line-haul capacity requirements, we were able to price e-commerce very competitively. I believe this e-commerce volume as a result is quite sticky. That being said, we continue to refine our commercial and network strategies to be prepared for when commercial capacity does come back. 
Overall demand for exports from Asia have recovered to pre-COVID levels. In fiscal year '22, our network plans include 6 intercontinental daily frequencies from Asia to provide more consistent, predictable capacity based on our demand forecast. This will eliminate some of the ad hoc nature of our flights in fiscal year '21. 
Intra-European B2B volumes have recovered to pre-COVID levels, while our growth is further accelerated by significant B2C volumes on our intercontinental lanes. With reduced pandemic-related uncertainty and industrial activity on the rise, we expect the overall European economy to be back to prepandemic levels in late calendar year '21. 
Raj covered our new European value proposition. Customers are very interested in both our new Europe to U.S. overnight service and e-commerce product expansion. On the Europe to U.S. lane, we have strong demand with a healthy mix of small and large businesses. We have deployed incremental capacity to serve this high-yielding segment. Our e-commerce value proposition, anchored by our new FedEx International Connect Plus product, is very compelling. We continue to gain new customers and have a very robust sales pipeline. 
In summary, we had a stellar fiscal year '21, and the strategies we have in place will help us to win what's next in '22 and well beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks."
124423,688620452,2327305,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2021",2021-06-24,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results reflect the tremendous momentum in our business and reinforce our growth strategy and investments across our network to grow our capabilities, improve collaboratio",1096,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results reflect the tremendous momentum in our business and reinforce our growth strategy and investments across our network to grow our capabilities, improve collaboration and drive efficiency. Our full year results include over $1 billion in variable incentive compensation expense as we reward our team members for their invaluable contributions. In the fourth quarter, FedEx continued to drive higher profitability with increased margins across the board. Consolidated revenue grew 30% year-over-year in the quarter, while adjusted operating income was up 117% even with higher cost to support increased demand, increased variable compensation expense of $380 million and our previously announced $100 million contribution to Yale University to support our carbon neutrality goals. 
Drilling down into those numbers. The rise in U.S. parcel volume was the greatest driver of our revenue growth. And through the incredibly hard work and ingenuity of our team members, we took a significant portion of that revenue growth to the bottom line. Ground revenue grew 27% in the fourth quarter, with operating margin increasing 310 basis points to 13.6%. Ground substantially improved margins and earned the most operating profit in their history. 
As our international business and e-commerce in the U.S. continued to grow, Express revenue grew 32% over Q4 last year, with adjusted operating margin up 340 basis points. Freight blew out this quarter with 38% revenue growth and their highest quarterly operating margin ever at 16.1%. They also topped $1 billion in operating income for the full year for the first time. 
With our overall profit growth, we generated a record $4.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow while balancing continued investment in the business, funding our pension plans by $300 million and strengthening our balance sheet. 
During the fourth quarter, we executed a debt refinancing and extinguishment transaction, underscoring our focus on reducing our financial leverage. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $2.6 billion or 11% of the total outstanding liability, eliminating all debt maturities through FY '25 and one in FY '27. This transaction resulted in a $393 million charge in Q4. However, it will lower our interest cost over the next 3 years with a positive payback on the transaction. 
In FY '22, we will continue to drive a robust growth strategy, capitalizing on global economic recovery and e-commerce. This focus will flex all levers of our business, including volume growth, yield management, operational efficiency and network optimization. The FY '22 adjusted EPS range we provided corresponds to 13% to 18% year-over-year growth on top of record FY '21 earnings. 
I'd make the following highlights behind that. We expect margins in all our transportation segments on an adjusted basis to exceed FY '21 levels driven by several key areas. We expect e-commerce to continue to drive higher profitability, and we will continue to invest in our FedEx Ground network to improve efficiency and utilization through expanded and new facilities as well as technology enhancements. We also look forward to incremental benefit from the completion of our physical integration of TNT, which will enable us to offer more and better services to our customers internationally. This key milestone will continue to drive momentum and provide a launch point for even better profitability down the road. 
Integration expenses will be lower in FY '22 than in FY '21, and  total integration spending is expected to be $1.8 billion, slightly higher than our previous estimate due to additional opportunities identified to further optimize legal entity structures and improve back-office automation. 
We expect continued improvement at FedEx Freight through our ongoing revenue quality and profitable growth strategies. Our outlook includes substantial funding of our incentive compensation programs for our team members. That said, variable compensation expense is not expected to be a headwind for fiscal '22. While we have clear growth opportunities, the widespread labor shortages impacting many companies and industries across the U.S. is also impacting us through higher wage rates and lower productivity, particularly in the first quarter, and this is reflected in our overall outlook for the year. 
Earlier, Raj talked about our innovate digitally initiatives. The spending related to these important projects is included in our outlook and will largely be recorded in the corporate eliminations and other section of our P&L. Further, we estimate a higher effective tax rate for fiscal '22 of approximately 24% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments. 
Finally, I will address our capital allocation, starting with capital expenditures, which is expected to be $7.2 billion in FY '22. This projects to 8% or less of revenue, which is the target level for the CapEx to revenue component of our FY '22 to '24 long-term incentive plan and remains below our historical capital intensity. Approximately half of our expected capital spending this year will be for growth, with the remainder for important projects like replacement of our aging FedEx Express aircraft, which not only is expected to have a high financial return, but is an important part of our strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. We'll also continue to invest in the modernization of our key Express hubs and upgrades to other facilities in all our transportation networks to drive efficiency. We will increase replacement of vehicles across the enterprise, which we largely deferred in FY '21. We will add safer, more energy-efficient equipment. All these projects will yield benefits in the near term and long term. 
We ended fiscal 2021 with $7.1 billion in cash. And as such, our leadership team is laser-focused on enhanced capital allocation opportunities, including our 15% dividend increase for fiscal '22, which raised the dividend to $3 per share, as we announced on June 14. Next, our plan to restart our stock buyback program during the first quarter, which we can do without having to increase leverage, and our focus primarily to offset dilutive effects of our equity compensation programs. And our plan to voluntarily contribute $500 million in FY '22 to a pension plan, which was funded at 95% on May 31. 
In closing, we are adding shareholder value by driving profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, generating strong free cash flow, focusing capital spending into the greatest areas of return, strengthening our balance sheet and improving cash return to shareholders. Based on record fourth quarter results we just covered and the future strategies we have in place, I can say with confidence that we fully expect FedEx to continue delivering sustainable and superior financial returns in the future. 
Next, we will be happy to address your questions."

Or would you guide us to something a little bit less than that considering what you're outlining on inflation side, which does seem to be a little bit front-end loaded?

[indiscernible] increased an astounding 23% and driven by e-commerce, and we still improve margins. So we highlighted that U.S. domestic parcel growth will continue to be the primarily driven by e-commerce, and we're very confident in our strategy to profitably execute against that. So we expect margins to improve in '22 and beyond as we continue to increase density, further improve the facility and on-road productivity, enhance the utilization of our assets. And I kind of emphasize those aspects as Ground is generating exceptional ROIC margins. And so we remain very confident of the future opportunity, and we'll continue to innovate and differentiate the capabilities there.

We think we have the very best value proposition in the market, full stop. We have the best weekend coverage. And so as a result, we think the demand that we are planning for will be there for quite some time here domestically. 
On the international side, it's a little bit of a different story and far more complex. We do believe, as I mentioned, that commercial capacity will come back. Episodically, it will not be a straight line up than we actually have, we believe, until 2024. The longer it takes for commercial capacity to come back, quite frankly, the longer we have to make sure that this customer base is sticky. 
I pointed out in my opening remarks that we had $1 billion growth in e-commerce. We priced this e-commerce volume at future price. It is going to be very sticky. It was very competitively priced. So we don't believe there's any risk there in our small business growth. We've also had internationally. We also believe that volume is very sticky. So as commercial capacity comes back, we'll adjust the network. We'll bend the cost curve to offset some of the surcharge risk. But overall, we feel quite good about strategies, and we have some time to implement them."

Well, since Freight hardly ever gets any questions, I want to take this opportunity to add to Brie's comments and recognize our team for an exceptional year. They successfully battled through what has been the most challenging year I have ever seen in my almost 30 years in this business, and I grew up in it. So I want to recognize all of the points they put on the Board. 
Now I'm sure you all have read the multiple articles written over the last several months about the tightening in the trucking industry, and it starts with the truckload sector. They are 5x the size of the LTL divisions. And when they get full, the spillover comes into LTL. We use the large LTL carrier get the majority of it. And so when you have it combined with what the broad actions our competitors have taken to embargo entire sections of the country without any notice, impacting all customers, we decided to take an implemented temporary targeted volume [indiscernible] to minimize the network disruptions and balance capacity to avoid the backlogs across the entire country. So with record growth, has come some tough but necessary decisions to protect our employees, reduce our backlogs and staff to our business volume. This continues to be the driving force behind our business decisions. 
Now in hindsight, I would not have wanted to make a decision back in the [ corner ] like this, and we're taking measures to avoid it going forward. I hope that provided the transparency."

You're going to get benefits of those new renegotiations in the back half of this fiscal year. We're going to get them in the front half of '22. And in addition, we still have to reprice the rest of the large customer segment. And really importantly, as Fred mentioned, it's not just about the top line yield. It's about really making sure that our price matches our cost. And we're getting very on that, very disciplined, making sure that customers that have large package, they have the right surcharges, the right structure there, those that have the highest peaking factor really pay for the incremental labor at peak. And so it's not just about the top line, which I am, I want to be clear, I'm optimistic about, but it's really about aligning our price strategy with our cost, and we do think that, that is going to have tremendous momentum next year and, quite frankly, the year after as well."

And if you can sort of meter that capacity out over the course of the next couple of years, it should support sort of a relatively robust pricing environment, certainly above cost inflation as we go out into the out year. So I guess what would sort of take away from that potential opportunity to bring those domestic margins back up to maybe where we had seen them a couple of years ago? Is there some other impediment that we're thinking about? Or is this really just a dynamic of trying to match capacity with the volume growth that you outlined that is fairly robust and maintain just a very, very good pricing environment for the foreseeable future?"

And then, of course, there has to be matched on the pricing side, which as Brie has covered, I think, pretty comprehensively.

And so we're trying to strike that right balance. And so some customers, yes, they did require in their portfolio, a change in mix to meet their business need because many of them saw explosive growth, especially in our retail segment and, of course, in our health care. So of course, as required, we do reopen account and have those conversations. Every Thursday morning, as Mike mentioned, Mike and Jill and I get together, and we review what's necessary to run the business. So I'm very pleased that the team has been incredibly agile. 
I think the second half of the question was about B2B and B2C. So I think the answer from a domestic is we are going to continue to make Express more express. We're going to lean into commercial. We're going to lean into premium. And health care, we're very optimistic about our last-mile optimization strategy, which will allow us to continue to residential business into the Ground network. When we -- and I guess the other thing that I can share is that if you look in May of this past year, it was our highest absolute commercial volume in the domestic network in September 2019. So we're very confident about the return of our commercial business here in the United States. 
However, as I mentioned, 90% of the market growth will be e-commerce. And so there will be no settling of the B2C volume within the Ground network. We're going to continue to drive that growth. We're going to lean into it, grow yield. And as Mike mentioned, our goal is to grow the margin while we do that.

If you go back when we talk about the LMO, FY '20, we only delivered 1.2 million packages of LMO. Through fiscal year '21, we delivered 21.6 million packages of LMO.

The next, if you'll remember, we integrated SmartPost, which is now our economy product, and plus the surging residential growth since the pandemic, and all these factors has helped us improve our residential density. 
Now one of the things to remember, we're seeing package matching where we have commercial, residential, economy or LMO packages where they're destined to the same address or nearby address for another Ground package, and we fully continue to expect this to continue to increase. 
We're also confident that our weekend residential delivery coverage, which has already mentioned, reaching 98% of the U.S. population on Saturdays and 95% on Sundays truly gives us a distinct competitive advantage."

And then from an Asia to Europe, that's our third focus area for the European team. We have historically been under-shared in that lane.

Fiscal '21 was truly unprecedented, and we are enormously proud of our 570,000 team members who performed magnificently to keep global health care, industrial and at-home supply chains open and, more recently, allowed significant additional commerce to flow. The FedEx team's role in moving PPE, vaccines and international relief shipments has been perhaps this company's finest hour. Our financial results speak for themselves. Raj and Mike will have more to say about the numbers of course.
Our pride in the FedEx team and our performance for shareholders is greatly tempered, however, by our continuing grief over the 15th April senseless murder at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis of 8 FedEx team members. Lingering sorrow among their families, friends and colleagues throughout FedEx can never be erased. Raj will also comment on this strategy in a moment.
The strategies we've executed over the last several years were carefully developed and have been executed at a high level with great success overall. As we've mentioned previously, the pandemic simply brought many of the market trends, which informed our strategies forward. Brie will be more specific about these trends in a moment.
As reported, FedEx revenues for FY '21 were $84 billion, and we project FY '22 revenues over $90 billion. We believe FedEx margins will continue to improve this fiscal year. However, as Raj will cover momentarily, the labor market in the U.S. over the last several months has been quite challenging, adversely affecting hiring and leading to significant reengineering of parts of our networks to deal with the lack of these resources. And while the situation has begun to abate, delivering a successful peak season when we anticipate significant year-over-year volume increases will require additional flexibility and creativity on the part of our management, staff and frontline team members while maintaining our safety above all culture.
To handle future ground volumes, we are significantly increasing capacity to deliver both great service and improved financial results. This summer, we are intently focused on improving network and delivery operations prior to the volume surge in the fall. There's great focus on revenue quality at FedEx. However, our focus solely on yields does not give a complete picture of our profit upside. As Brie will explain, our alliances with retailer partners generate significant amounts of short-haul traffic, much of which is now shipped from stores.
Our innovate digitally initiatives are gaining steam, particularly Surround and SenseAware. Let me thank Henry Maier for more than 34 years of loyal and dedicated service to FedEx and RPS, which we acquired in 1998. At the conclusion of this call, I'll have additional comments about Henry's remarkable career and countless contributions to FedEx' growth and success.
A further note, the Biden administration has recognized an exceptional talent and our Board member, General Chris Inglis, who was confirmed by the Senate last week to serve as the National Cyber Director. We benefited from Chris' cybersecurity and information technology expertise since he joined our Board in 2015, and we wish him well in the hugely important role for which he has been tapped.
Now Raj, Brie and Mike will give their remarks, after which we will answer your questions. Raj?"

Alexander; Samaria Blackwell; Amarjeet Johal; Jaswinder Kaur; Amarjit Sekhon; Jaswinder Singh; Karli Smith; and John Weisert. Our most heartfelt sympathies and condolences remain with the families, team members and friends of these individuals. They will forever be members of the FedEx family.
Now turning to our results. Fiscal year '21 was a pivotal year for FedEx as we delivered incredible financial performance, including record revenue and profit in Q4 and for the full fiscal year. This is in no short measure due to the outstanding work by our global team members. Let me take this opportunity to say thank you to the FedEx team, especially those on the front lines, for going above and beyond the call of duty in these difficult times. When I look back at fiscal year '21, I'm proud of the role FedEx played in saving lives, helping small and medium businesses get back on their feet and keeping the globe connected.
The exceptional financial performance was driven by our robust growth strategy and focused execution on 3 key areas: e-commerce, operational excellence and digital innovation. Let me take a moment to highlight each strategic focus area and the progress made in Q4.
Firstly, e-commerce. The acceleration of trends experienced in fiscal year '21 highlight the importance of our ongoing strategic initiatives to win globally in e-commerce. This includes FedEx Ground 7-day operations, investing in technology to optimize last-mile deliveries, expanding capabilities to better handle large items, offering the first FedEx-branded through-the-door service with FedEx Freight Direct and accelerating the expansion of our retail convenience network. Ground's full 7-day operations, including weekend residential delivery coverage that reaches 98% of the U.S. population on Saturdays and 95% on Sundays, give us a distinct competitive advantage. We are working very closely with customers to leverage the full flexibility of weekend operations, so they can meet the demands of e-commerce every day of the week. This is evident in the growth we saw in Ground Sunday deliveries with 56% more packages delivered on Sunday in Q4 than last year. We are also winning in e-commerce outside the United States by leveraging the strength of our global networks and the expansion of our portfolio. Brie will cover additional details in this regard shortly.
The second strategic focus area is operational excellence. Our competitive advantage in the marketplace is fueled by a relentless focus on operational excellence and customer service. While service is a hallmark of FedEx, like many businesses, we are facing challenges with labor availability, which have contributed to recent service levels that do not meet our own high expectations of the quality we expect to deliver to our customers. The inability to hire team members, particularly package handlers, has driven wage rates higher and creates inefficiency in our networks as we use overtime to cover open shifts and route volume around known constraints just as a few examples. As such, we're taking bold actions across the business to address service issues and prepare for sustained volume increases, including continued investments in people, capacity and technology to optimize our networks.
FedEx Ground's strategic focus on efficiency continued to reap benefits in Q4, as seen in our ongoing improvements in density. These improvements are driven in part by both B2B and B2C volume growth as well as enhancements in route optimization technology, which draw up the average number of stops the service providers made per hour by 3.6% versus Q4 of the previous fiscal year. Along with the revised service provider e-commerce rate structure, these efficiencies contributed to a 3% reduction in cost per stop compared to the same quarter last year. Further collaboration to improve efficiency continued across our businesses as we expanded our last-mile optimization program. In addition, FedEx Freight provided approximately 70 million line-haul miles and delivered 1.75 million packages for Ground in fiscal year '21.
Another significant opportunity in further enhancing our operational excellence is the improvement and the profitability of our international operations, which starts in Europe with the completion of the physical integration of TNT. While the TNT integration has seen its share of setbacks, including a 2017 cyber attack and the delays due to the pandemic, we are certain of the value this combination creates for the FedEx of the future.
The European restructuring announced in January 2021 is set to deliver $275 million to $350 million in benefits on an annual basis starting in fiscal 2024. The cost of the severance benefit under this program, which will be incurred through fiscal 2023, will be in the range from $300 million to $575 million in cash expenditures.
In Q4, we introduced overnight service from Europe, connecting 90% of European businesses to major U.S. markets. It's an unparalleled next-day connectivity that nobody in the marketplace matches. As you can see, we continue to enhance value for our customers while restructuring our European business. Said simply, the upside in the profitability of our international business is tremendous.
Finally, our third strategic focus area, digital innovation. We are reimagining our digital capabilities and infrastructure in a manner that will deliver market-leading customer experiences that are simple, personal and proactive. We made great strides in fiscal 2021 as we continue to drive new value through strategic technologies, including increasing capabilities and products through sensor-based technologies like FedEx SenseAware ID and FedEx Surround, which provide unmatched visibility and predictive capabilities most notably seen during the transportation of life-saving COVID-19 vaccines.

In fiscal 2022, we'll continue to deliver on our strategy on e-commerce, operational excellence and digital innovation as we execute on the following key initiatives. First, we expect to substantially increase capacity for this peak by investing in FedEx Ground's infrastructure with the addition of 16 new automated facilities and the implementation of nearly 100 expansion projects at existing operations and key technological enhancements. Second, we will complete the air network integration in early calendar year 2022, which will bring the physical TNT network integration to a close and provides the inflection point for long-term profit improvement in Europe. Next, we are exercising existing options to purchase 20 additional 767Fs, 10 for delivery in fiscal year '24 and 10 for delivery in fiscal year '24 and 10 for delivery in fiscal year '25 as we continue to modernize our fleet and improve service to our customers. And we finally continue to identify areas to adapt, collaborate and utilize different elements of our global network to increase efficiency and reduce cost to serve.
Our networks and capabilities reflect decades of investment, innovation and expertise that are differentiated from our competition. It's incredibly difficult to replicate and provides a significant advantage over others in our industry.
When we knit it all back together, despite some of the cyclical factors, we remain very confident for fiscal year '22 and beyond. The e-commerce market will continue to be a growth engine globally. And if anything has become clear over the past year, it's the contribution our industry provides to the e-commerce value chain. We remain focused on differentiation, building customer solutions and improving revenue quality as critical long-term levers of profitable growth. In addition, the transformation efforts in Europe and U.S. domestic will generate margin improvement opportunities.
And finally, we're just getting started on unlocking value with digital innovation. Our robust growth strategy positions FedEx to deliver superior, sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come.
With that, I will turn it over to Brie."
124423,688620452,2327392,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2021",2021-06-24,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In a year of extraordinary challenges and change for our business, I continue to be immensely proud of the team's ability to execute our commercial strategy while developing solutions to help our customers grow th",987,"Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. In a year of extraordinary challenges and change for our business, I continue to be immensely proud of the team's ability to execute our commercial strategy while developing solutions to help our customers grow their businesses. Before I move into fiscal year '22, I wanted to reflect on our truly exceptional results of '21.
Fiscal year '21 parcel volume was very strong across our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. Average daily volume grew across all our customer segments, with U.S. small and medium leading the way at 32% year-over-year growth. E-commerce also drove 28% year-over-year growth in our returns business through April. As more consumers shopped online, enrolled FedEx delivery manager users grew by 43% year-over-year. With this backdrop and the momentum from fiscal '21, our fiscal '22 outlook calls for robust growth. Enterprise growth in fiscal year '22 will be primarily driven by U.S. domestic e-commerce growth, followed by strength in B2B and international and a focus on revenue quality.
In the United States, the flourishing U.S. domestic parcel market will continue to provide opportunity in the coming years. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to surpass 107 million packages a day in calendar year '22, with e-commerce contributing 88% of total U.S. market growth. Excluding Amazon volume, the U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to be 72 million packages a day in calendar year '22. As we look beyond calendar year '22, we forecast that the U.S. domestic parcel market will reach 172 million packages a day in calendar year 2026.
In fiscal year '21, FedEx total U.S. domestic residential package volume mix was 67% versus 62% a year ago. As we look beyond this fiscal year, we expect residential volumes to grow significantly faster than commercial volume. However, with retail inventories relative to sales at historic lows, we expect solid B2B volume growth this fiscal year.
In fiscal year '22, we will continue to execute against our revenue quality strategy. In fiscal year '21 Q4, we increased FedEx Ground Economy yields by 28%, and overall, U.S. domestic residential yields by 16% year-over-year. It is important to note when reviewing composite U.S. domestic yields, that weights and zone will decrease, putting pressure on yields as we grow in e-commerce. We are managing total network profitability. Short zone e-commerce and our FedEx Ground Economy service will enable us to sweat our assets and maximize sortation capacity.
Within our pricing strategy, we continue to prioritize capacity for commercial and small and medium customer segments. To support the network amid ongoing capacity constraints, we have increased our peak surcharges as of June 21, and we'll monitor and adjust our strategy as capacity and demand warrant.
We will continue to confidently renegotiate our large customer segment contracts to increase profitability. This means balancing product, day of week and lane mix at the customer level while ensuring appropriate surcharges and rate increases cover rising labor costs. Most large customer contracts in the U.S. are 3 years. Almost half of our total large segment volume had pricing agreement implementations in the past 12 months, leaving upside for fiscal year '22.
Now turning to international. Global trade volume has surpassed pre-pandemic levels and is on course for its fastest year of growth in over a decade. Global air cargo capacity remained down 10% year-over-year as of April mainly due to the reduction in passenger belly capacity. We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year '22. Recovery will be slow, potentially episodic, and a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. We believe a favorable pricing internationally should continue through fiscal year 2022. We will continue to manage demand internationally using yield management and continuation of peak surcharges, especially on transpacific and transatlantic lanes. We are seeing a very good capture rate on these surcharges.
While peak surcharges played a significant role in our international performance in fiscal year '21, it was not the majority of our revenue growth. In fiscal '21, we improved parcel and priority mix versus freight and economy, grew our small and medium customer base while penetrating e-commerce. In fact, we grew e-commerce parcel volume by more than $1 billion year-over-year out of Asia and Europe.
To a large extent, due to its lightweight nature and limited relative line-haul capacity requirements, we were able to price e-commerce very competitively. I believe this e-commerce volume as a result is quite sticky. That being said, we continue to refine our commercial and network strategies to be prepared for when commercial capacity does come back.
Overall demand for exports from Asia have recovered to pre-COVID levels. In fiscal year '22, our network plans include 6 intercontinental daily frequencies from Asia to provide more consistent, predictable capacity based on our demand forecast. This will eliminate some of the ad hoc nature of our flights in fiscal year '21.
Intra-European B2B volumes have recovered to pre-COVID levels, while our growth is further accelerated by significant B2C volumes on our intercontinental lanes. With reduced pandemic-related uncertainty and industrial activity on the rise, we expect the overall European economy to be back to pre-pandemic levels in late calendar year '21.
Raj covered our new European value proposition. Customers are very interested in both our new Europe to U.S. overnight service and e-commerce product expansion. On the Europe to U.S. lane, we have strong demand with a healthy mix of small and large businesses. We have deployed incremental capacity to serve this high-yielding segment. Our e-commerce value proposition, anchored by our new FedEx International Connect Plus product, is very compelling. We continue to gain new customers and have a very robust sales pipeline. In summary, we had a stellar fiscal year '21, and the strategies we have in place will help us to win what's next in '22 and well beyond.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks."
124423,688620452,2327392,"FedEx Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2021",2021-06-24,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results reflect the tremendous momentum in our business and reinforce our growth strategy and investments across our network to grow our capabilities, improve collaboration",1095,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results reflect the tremendous momentum in our business and reinforce our growth strategy and investments across our network to grow our capabilities, improve collaboration and drive efficiency. Our full year results include over $1 billion in variable incentive compensation expense as we reward our team members for their invaluable contributions. In the fourth quarter, FedEx continued to drive higher profitability with increased margins across the board. Consolidated revenue grew 30% year-over-year in the quarter, while adjusted operating income was up 117% even with higher cost to support increased demand, increased variable compensation expense of $380 million and our previously announced $100 million contribution to Yale University to support our carbon neutrality goals.
Drilling down into those numbers. The rise in U.S. parcel volume was the greatest driver of our revenue growth. And through the incredibly hard work and ingenuity of our team members, we took a significant portion of that revenue growth to the bottom line. Ground revenue grew 27% in the fourth quarter with operating margin increasing 310 basis points to 13.6%. Ground substantially improved margins and earned the most operating profit in their history.
As our international business and e-commerce in the U.S. continued to grow, Express revenue grew 32% over Q4 last year with adjusted operating margin up 340 basis points. Freight blew out this quarter with 38% revenue growth and their highest quarterly operating margin ever at 16.1%. They also topped $1 billion in operating income for the full year for the first time. With our overall profit growth, we generated a record $4.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow while balancing continued investment in the business, funding our pension plans by $300 million and strengthening our balance sheet. 
During the fourth quarter, we executed a debt refinancing and extinguishment transaction, underscoring our focus on reducing our financial leverage. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $2.6 billion or 11% of the total outstanding liability, eliminating all debt maturities through FY '25 and 1 in FY '27. This transaction resulted in a $393 million charge in Q4. However, it will lower our interest cost over the next 3 years with a positive payback on the transaction.
In FY '22, we will continue to drive a robust growth strategy capitalizing on global economic recovery and e-commerce. This focus will flex all levers of our business, including volume growth, yield management, operational efficiency and network optimization. The FY '22 adjusted EPS range we provided corresponds to 13% to 18% year-over-year growth on top of record FY '21 earnings.
I'd make the following highlights behind that. We expect margins in all our transportation segments on an adjusted basis to exceed FY '21 levels driven by several key areas. We expect e-commerce to continue to drive higher profitability, and we will continue to invest in our FedEx Ground network to improve efficiency and utilization through expanded and new facilities as well as technology enhancements.
We also look forward to incremental benefit from the completion of our physical integration of TNT, which will enable us to offer more and better services to our customers internationally. This key milestone will continue to drive momentum and provide a launch point for even better profitability down the road.
Integration expenses will be lower in FY '22 than in FY '21, and total integration spending is expected to be $1.8 billion, slightly higher than our previous estimate due to additional opportunities identified to further optimize legal entity structures and improve back-office automation.
We expect continued improvement at FedEx Freight through our ongoing revenue quality and profitable growth strategies. Our outlook includes substantial funding of our incentive compensation programs for our team members. That said, variable compensation expense is not expected to be a headwind for fiscal '22. While we have clear growth opportunities, the widespread labor shortages impacting many companies and industries across the U.S. is also impacting us through higher wage rates and lower productivity, particularly in the first quarter, and this is reflected in our overall outlook for the year.
Earlier, Raj talked about our innovate digitally initiatives. The spending related to these important projects is included in our outlook and will largely be recorded in the corporate eliminations and other section of our P&L. Further, we estimate a higher effective tax rate for fiscal '22 of approximately 24% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments.
Finally, I will address our capital allocation, starting with capital expenditures, which is expected to be $7.2 billion in FY '22. This projects to 8% or less of revenue, which is the target level for the CapEx-to-revenue component of our FY '22 to '24 long-term incentive plan and remains below our historical capital intensity. Approximately half of our expected capital spending this year will be for growth with the remainder for important projects like replacement of our aging FedEx Express aircraft, which not only is expected to have a high financial return but is an important part of our strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. We'll also continue to invest in the modernization of our key Express hubs and upgrades to other facilities in all our transportation networks to drive efficiency.
We will increase replacement of vehicles across the enterprise, which we largely deferred in FY '21. We will add safer, more energy-efficient equipment. All these projects will yield benefits in the near term and long term.
We ended fiscal 2021 with $7.1 billion in cash, and as such, our leadership team is laser focused on enhanced capital allocation opportunities, including our 15% dividend increase for fiscal '22, which raised the dividend to $3 per share as we announced on June 14. Next, our plan to restart our stock buyback program during the first quarter, which we can do without having to increase leverage and our focus primarily to offset dilutive effects of our equity compensation programs; and our plan to voluntarily contribute $500 million in FY '22 to our pension plan, which was funded at 95% on May 31.
In closing, we are adding shareholder value by driving profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, generating strong free cash flow, focusing capital spending into the greatest areas of return, strengthening our balance sheet and improving cash return to shareholders. Based on record fourth quarter results we just covered and the future strategies we have in place, I can say with confidence that we fully expect FedEx to continue delivering sustainable and superior financial returns in the future.
Next, we will be happy to address your questions."

Obviously, some considerable operating leverage here in terms of incrementals year-over-year. You've talked about the right sort, the right package, the right truck, but clearly, there's some inflation working its way through the system. So can we think about double digits on the way to teens? Or would you guide us to something a little bit less than that considering what you're outlining on inflation side, which does seem to be a little bit front-end loaded? So maybe if you can address that and also about the surcharges that you might be able to install to offset some of those costs."

But as we've said, the pandemic accelerated the dramatic and rapid shift in the growth of e-commerce, and at the same time, as you noted there, put some pressure in areas along the way as well, which is really why the performance at Ground in '21 has been nothing short of stellar. ADV increased an astounding 23% driven by e-commerce, and we still improved  margins. So Brie highlighted that U.S. domestic parcel growth will continue to be the primary -- primarily driven by e-commerce, and we're very confident in our strategy to profitably execute against that.
So we expect margins to improve in '22 and beyond as we continue to increase density, further improve the facility and on-road productivity, enhance the utilization of our assets. And I kind of emphasize those aspects as Ground is generating exceptional ROIC margins. And so we remain very confident of the future opportunity, and we'll continue to innovate and differentiate the capabilities there. There was something about surcharges that you asked as well. Maybe you can clarify that."

Here in the U.S., you heard me quote some just outstanding growth numbers from a parcel perspective. So we think we actually have quite a sustained growth environment. While demand will outpace capacity in the domestic market, structurally, as I mentioned, we will continue to use surcharges not only for peak but to cover large package and to really just make sure that our pricing, quite frankly, aligns to our cost. We think we have the very best value proposition in the market, full stop. We have the best weekend coverage. And so as a result, we think the demand that we are planning for will be there for quite some time here domestically.
On the international side, it's a little bit of a different story and far more complex. We do believe, as I mentioned, that commercial capacity will come back. Episodically, it will not be a straight line up and we actually have, we believe, until 2024. The longer it takes for commercial capacity to come back, quite frankly, the longer we have to make sure that this customer base is sticky.
I pointed out in my opening remarks that we had $1 billion growth in e-commerce. We priced this e-commerce volume at future price. It is going to be very sticky. It was very competitively priced, so we don't believe there's any risk there in our small business growth. We've also had internationally. We also believe that volume is very sticky. So as commercial capacity comes back, we'll adjust the network. We'll bend the cost curve to offset some of the surcharge risk. But overall, we feel quite good about the strategies, and we have some time to implement them."

Well, since Freight hardly ever gets any questions, I want to take this opportunity to add to Brie's comments and recognize our team for an exceptional year. They successfully battled through what has been the most challenging year I have ever seen in my almost 30 years in this business, and I grew up in it. So I want to recognize all of the points they put on the board.
Now I'm sure you all have read the multiple articles written over the last several months about the tightening in the trucking industry, and it starts with the truckload sector. They are 5x the size of the LTL divisions. And when they get full, the spillover comes into LTL. We as the largest LTL carrier get the majority of it. And so when you have it combined with what the broad actions our competitors have taken to embargo entire sections of the country without any notice, impacting all customers, we decided to take an implemented temporary targeted volume control designed to minimize the network disruptions and balance capacity to avoid the backlogs across the entire country. So with record growth has come some tough but necessary decisions to protect our employees, reduce our backlogs and staff to our business volume. This continues to be the driving force behind our business decisions.
Now in hindsight, I would not have wanted to make a decision back in the corner like this, and we're taking measures to avoid it going forward. I hope that provided transparency."

As we look at '22 and '23, we absolutely think that you're going to see a greater than our historical average from a year-over-year price increase. As I mentioned this past year, when we look at our domestic volume, we've repriced about 45% of our large customer segment, and quite frankly, we actually did most of that in the back half of this year. So we're going to have some lapping. You're going to get benefits of those renegotiations in the back half of this fiscal year. We're going to get them in the front half of '22. In addition, we still have to reprice the rest of the large customer segment.
And really importantly, as Fred mentioned, it's not just about the top line yield. It's about really making sure that our price matches our cost. And we're getting very on that, very disciplined, making sure that customers that have large package, they have the right surcharges, the right structure there, those that have the highest peaking factor really pay for the incremental labor at peak. And so it's not just about the top line, which I am -- I want to be clear, I'm optimistic about, but it's really about aligning our price strategy with our cost. And we do think that, that is going to have tremendous momentum next year and, quite frankly, the year after as well."

So I guess what would sort of take away from that potential opportunity to bring those domestic margins back up to maybe where we had seen them a couple of years ago? Is there some other impediment that we're thinking about? Or is this really just a dynamic of trying to match capacity with the volume growth that you outlined that is fairly robust and maintain just a very, very good pricing environment for the foreseeable future?"

The CapEx growth at Ground is focused on smaller units than kind of going back the historical legacy large hubs.

And so that's why when we talk about having the right targeted investments to align the cost with the -- where demand is going, that's how we're thinking about it. And then, of course, it has to be matched on the pricing side, which as Brie has covered, I think, pretty comprehensively. So again, it's a -- it's an integrated planning process and assessment here.

We have opened some contracts out of cycle when the customer has looked for increased demand. And so, of course, when they want to do something different than what has kind of been our historical average with them, of course, we're going to have those conversations.
I think it's really important. Yes, we want to grow our price. Yes, we want to grow our yield, but we also want to have really happy, satisfied customers. And so we're trying to strike that right balance. And so some customers, yes, they did require changes in their portfolio, a change in mix to meet their business needs because many of them saw explosive growth, especially in our retail segment and, of course, in our health care. So of course, as required, we do reopen account and have those conversations. Every Thursday morning, as Mike mentioned, Mike and Jill and I get together, and we review what's necessary to run the business. So I'm very pleased that the team has been incredibly agile.
I think the second half of the question was about B2B and B2C. So I think the answer from a domestic perspective is we are going to continue to make Express more express. We're going to lean into commercial. We're going to lean into premium. And health care, we're very optimistic about our last-mile optimization strategy, which will allow us to continue to put some residential business into the Ground network. When we -- and I guess the other thing that I can share is that if you look in May of this past year, it was our highest absolute commercial volume in the domestic network since September 2019. So we're very confident about the return of our commercial business here in the United States.
However, as I mentioned, 90% of the market growth will be e-commerce, and so there will be no settling of the B2C volume within the Ground network. We're going to continue to drive that growth. We're going to lean into it, grow yield. And as Mike mentioned, our goal is to grow the margin while we do that. So very, very, quite frankly, excited to lean into the e-commerce growth for FedEx Ground."

One, on the inventory side, not only is it finished product, but it's raw materials, i.e. chips and other things that are going into finished products. So that remains at historically low levels.
The demand also hasn't abated. And so the demand cycle that we're seeing, both domestically and internationally, continues to be extremely strong. And then the combination of the supply being light, both in the air and the ocean that has trickle down and trickle up effect, certainly, it is factors that have us remaining optimistic that there's no short-term change in what we're seeing. As a matter of fact, I'm seeing an intensification of that in our international business."

So we have upside potential on both the B2B and the B2C market share into the United States from Europe.
From an intra-Europe perspective, we are predominantly focused on B2B. We're just getting going on B2C, but we see upward potential there, and we actually also are seeing improving yields in the intra-European theater. So from an intra-Europe perspective, we're feeling optimistic.
And then from an Asia to Europe, that's our third focus area for the European team. We have historically been under shared in that lane. We have seen a tremendous relationship between our Asia and our European teams. Actually, our Asia team has taken share from DHL the last 4 quarters, so we're pretty pleased with them.

First and foremost, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to our global team members who continue to deliver for our customers in an exceptionally challenging operating environment. We are extremely proud and grateful for the manner in which Team FedEx continues to move the world forward. 
The execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services despite the disruptive impact of the pandemic to labor availability, industry capacity and global supply chains. As we look at our first quarter results, our performance was highlighted by double-digit increases in yield across all our transportation businesses driven by limited capacity, high demand and our revenue management strategy. 
The impact of constrained labor markets remains the biggest issue facing our business as with many other companies around the world and was a key driver of our lower-than-expected results in the first quarter. As Michael will share in more detail momentarily, we estimate that the impact of labor shortages on our quarterly results was approximately $450 million, primarily at FedEx Ground. 
Labor shortages have had 2 distinct impacts on our business. The competition for talent, particularly for our frontline workers, have driven wage rates higher and pay premiums higher. While wage rates are higher, the more significant impact is the widespread inefficiencies in our operation from constrained labor markets. To illustrate this, I'd like to share a brief example from FedEx Ground. 
Our Portland, Oregon hub is running with approximately 65% of the staffing needed to handle its normal volume. This staffing shortage has a pronounced impact on the operations, which results in our teams diverting 25% of the volume that would normally flow to this hub because it simply cannot be processed efficiently to meet our service standards. And in this case, the volume that's diverted must be rerouted and processed, which drives inefficiencies in our operations and, in turn, higher costs. These inefficiencies included adding incremental line haul and delivery routes, meaning more miles driven and a higher use of third-party transportation to enable us to bypass Portland entirely. 
Now that's merely one example. Across the FedEx Ground network there are more than 600,000 packages a day being rerouted. We anticipate the cost pressures from network inefficiencies such as the one I just illustrated to persist through peak as we navigate the labor market and impacts of new COVID waves. 
Overcoming these staffing and retention challenges is our utmost priority as they not only affect our cost structures and operational efficiency but also having a negative impact on service levels. As such, we are taking bold action across the enterprise to hire and invest in our frontline team members as we prepare for the peak season ahead. These actions include targeted pay premiums, particularly for weekend shifts; increased [ cut ] reimbursement sponsorship of a national hiring Day on September 23 as we seek to hire 90,000 additional positions ahead of peak; detailed volume and demand planning with customers to drive additional sorts to alleviate congestion; and expanding network capacity, which I will touch on shortly. Based on these actions, combined with our expectations for improving labor conditions, we do anticipate gradual improvement in our operational efficiency as we turn into the new calendar year. 
During the first quarter, the team continued to execute on our strategy even amid the challenging operating environment. As e-commerce drives higher demand, we continue to strategically invest in our network to boost daily package volume capacity, increase efficiencies and further enhance the speed and service capabilities of our networks. Our investments continued in Q1 as FedEx Ground expanded its physical footprint with a new state-of-the-art hub in Chino, California, which began operations in August. This fully automated hub includes large package sortation, has the capability to process up to 30,000 packages per hour and strategically located to help address ongoing port congestion challenges. FedEx Ground also continues to see year-over-year improvement in last mile efficiency driven by a 2.4% increase of packages delivered per hour compared to Q1 last year, thanks to route optimization technology. 
As we move into Q2, we are meticulously planning for peak season ahead, including close collaboration with customers to build solutions to enable them to succeed. We expect to have substantially higher ground capacity in this peak season due to our investments in FedEx Ground's infrastructure. This includes the addition of more than a dozen new automated facilities and several other sortation equipment expansions in addition to the Chino hub that I already mentioned. 
Several key technology projects are also slated for completion this fall, including the modernization of multiple sortation, transportation management and safety systems, which will help to increase Ground's network capacity by hundreds of thousands of [ AD ] as well as its flexibility and resiliency. This brings a total capacity increase of more than 1 million average daily volume compared to last week. 
Another significant opportunity in our growth strategy is the improvement in the profitability of our international Express operations. We reached a significant agreement with the social partners at our [ early age ] Express operations regarding the intended European air network transformation. This is an important milestone in the completion of the air network integration, which remains on track for completion in spring 2022. That will bring the physical network integration of TNT into FedEx to a close, and when combined with the benefits of our previously announced European restructuring provides significant upside in our international profitability moving forward. 
In summary, we are taking bold actions in the short term to navigate through this highly uncertain environment. We remain committed to long-term shareholder return, and we are very confident in our strategy for the following reasons. We have a differentiated portfolio of services to attack the fast-growing e-commerce market. Our business model gives us the framework to be very successful in this regard. In fact, we are working strategically with several retailers to deliver a win-win-win solution: win for the retailer, win for the end consumer and win for FedEx. For instance, we recently partnered with a large retailer to create a common data platform that drives optimization of our combined assets and enhancement of visibility and predictability to the end customer. Further, as the day-definite residential volumes grow in our network, there's increasing opportunity to collaborate across our operating companies to improve efficiency by better utilizing our assets. 
Another upside for FedEx is international as the completion of our physical integration in Europe provides an inflection point for profitable growth. And finally, we are in the early stages of unlocking value from digital innovation. We are confident that this will play a significant part in success of FedEx for years to come as we make supply chains work smarter for everyone. Our strategy is sound and positions us well for improved returns as we move through fiscal year '22 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brie."
124423,1671945881,2399860,"FedEx Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone.

Our first quarter commercial results were very strong with 14% revenue growth and double-digit yield improvement in our transportation segments. These results reflect the positive backdrop for growth in the parcel market, including a very healthy pricing environment. 
For fiscal year '22, FedEx revenue was forecasted to pass $90 billion. Further, we are forecasting that the U.S. parcel market will grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, which is year-over-year growth of 12%. These market projections are slightly lower than last quarter as e-commerce percentage as a percentage of retail declined. We saw a shift to in-store shopping and buy online, pick up in store, and spending and services, of course, increased. However, despite this moderate change in e-commerce growth, the secular trend of e-commerce growing as a percentage of retail will continue to drive healthy parcel market growth. We are forecasting a 10% annual growth rate of U.S. domestic market volumes through 2026. 
At FedEx in the first quarter, total U.S. domestic package volumes increased year-over-year by 1.5%. At Express, our total U.S. domestic package volume grew 7% year-over-year. Total FedEx Ground volumes were relatively flat in the quarter. However, I'm very proud as we proactively managed our capacity for higher-yielding commercial and home delivery services. In fact, FedEx Ground commercial volumes grew double digits in the quarter. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year '22, FedEx's total U.S. domestic residential package volume mix was 57% versus 62% a year ago. U.S. B2B mix improved year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 as B2B volumes continue to recover with inventory replenishment and manufacturing rebounding as the economy opens. EDC mix continues to remain higher, however, than pre-pandemic levels. 
In Q1, FedEx Freight revenue increased 23%, driven both by increased volume and higher revenue quality, a huge shout out to the FedEx Freight team, great job team. FedEx Freight Direct continues to create incredible momentum. 
Turning now to our revenue quality strategy. The continued constrained capacity in both the U.S. domestic and international markets has led to a very favorable pricing environment. We are focused on protecting and growing volume in high-yielding commercial segments, including commercial ground and small and medium segments. We have an incremental opportunity to improve large customer yields through contract renewals and providing large customers an ability to procure incremental capacity at current market rates. 
As announced yesterday, effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9%, while FedEx Freight rates will increase by an average of 5.9% to 7.9%. We also announced other surcharge increases, which can be found on fedex.com. These increases will help us continue to balance capacity with demand and mitigate the impact from the increased cost that Raj just outlined. 
Turning now to international. We are forecasting the air cargo market to be more than $80 billion by calendar year 2025. At FedEx, we currently have single-digit market share, and as such, this remains a significant growth opportunity for us to continue to pursue. We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022. A full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. 
Global air cargo capacity continued to recover in July. It is still down 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Capacity on international lanes remains scarce, and we have seen European and APAC export demand recover to pre-pandemic levels. Globally, we continue our efforts to optimize our network and customer mix. We managed to a very high percentage of priority service on our international flights with yield per package improvement of 11% for international parcel and yield per pound improvement of 18% for international freight. 
Exports from Asia are fueled by the strong demand from B2C and B2B recovery. B2B will further benefit from a shift in demand from ocean freight to air cargo as our customers replenish stock levels in time for the peak sales season. To provide access to reliable capacity in this constrained environment, we turned 6 previously ad hoc intercontinental flights into scheduled service in the fiscal year quarter 1, 4 transpacific and 2 for the Asia-Europe lane. We are seeing a strong recovery in Europe as well with the overall economic recovery back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Our intra-Europe cross-border B2B volumes have recovered to pre-COVID levels. Our growth is further accelerated by significant B2C parcel volumes. E-commerce growth will be critical for both our Asian and European businesses. In Q1, we expanded FedEx International Connect Plus from Europe to 6 new global destinations, increasing coverage to 82% of global GDP across a total of 300 lanes. And on September 1, we launched FICP in EMEA across 80 origin destination lanes. 
For businesses looking for a cost-effective solution with competitive transit, FICP provides a compelling e-commerce value proposition. We continue to gain new customers through FICP and have a very robust sales pipeline. 
In summary, while it continues to be a very dynamic market, we remain incredibly confident in our global growth potential and our world-class commercial teams to bring in market-leading yields. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks."
124423,1671945881,2399860,"FedEx Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter FY '22 adjusted earnings per share of $4.37 was negatively impacted by approximately $800 million in year-over-year headwinds. And while Raj covered the operational impacts of these challeng",1299,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter FY '22 adjusted earnings per share of $4.37 was negatively impacted by approximately $800 million in year-over-year headwinds. And while Raj covered the operational impacts of these challenges, I will detail the financial impacts to the quarter. 
Of these headwinds, the difficult labor market had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $450 million in additional year-over-year cost, the majority of which impacted our FedEx Ground business. As we look into the impact of labor cost in the business, I want to break this impact into 2 components: higher wages and the impact of network inefficiencies. Of the $450 million, we estimate that $200 million was incurred in higher wage and purchase transportation rates. This included higher wage rates and pay premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services. 
In addition to the higher wage rates, we estimate that network inefficiencies of approximately $250 million contributed to the total impact of labor shortages on the business. These costs include additional line haul, higher usage of third-party transportation, cost to reposition assets in the network, overtime and recruiting incentives, all to address staffing shortages. 
Beyond the labor impacts, our results for the first quarter also included the following headwinds: an additional $135 million in our health care costs due to lower utilization a year ago; $85 million related to investments in the ground network, which represents the cost of bringing online 16 new automated facilities and expansions at 100 facilities, which are critical to improving service and adding capacity to meet growth for peak and beyond; and at Express, we had an estimated $60 million in incremental air network costs due to the impact of COVID restrictions on our operations, including limitations on layovers, supplemental crews to ensure service continuity and immigration restrictions. 
In addition, and as a reminder, our prior year results at Express included a pretax benefit of $65 million from a reduction in aviation excise taxes. That said, our first quarter results did come in lower than our own expectations as difficult labor conditions persisted throughout the quarter. As a result of that, variable compensation was not an expense headwind in the first quarter. 
With that overview of the consolidated results, let's turn to the highlights for the segments. At Express, results declined due to the higher operating expenses from staffing challenges and COVID-related air network impacts I discussed. Profitability was also impacted by fewer charter flights compared to the surge last spring during the early months of the pandemic. 
While we've covered the impacts to ground results in detail, I would like to call your attention to an enhancement in our reporting included in the release and the 10-Q. As a result of business growth and our unmatched 7-day operating network at ground, we are now providing additional product level disclosures for average daily package volume. Beginning with our first quarter, we are breaking out ADV statistics for FedEx Ground commercial, home delivery and economy services. 
Turning to freight. We reported a record operating margin of 17.3% for the quarter as our continued focus on revenue quality and profitable growth drove average daily shipments up 12% and revenue per shipment increased 11% as Brie highlighted previously. 
Now let's move it to capital spending. During the first quarter, we spent $1.6 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital and IT platforms. Our capital forecast for fiscal '22 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue and includes the following key elements. 
First, more than 50% increase in capital spending at ground year-over-year for capacity expansion and new facilities to capture opportunities from growing e-commerce business. And second, fleet modernization in Express with continued investment in 767 and 777 aircraft, which not only has a high financial return but is an important part of the strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. 
In evaluating capital investments, our return on invested capital on existing capital and new projects is a critical metric to managing our business, and we have a rigorous approval process in place on all new capital projects. As we look at investments, we set the internal rate of return hurdle above our weighted average cost of capital, which varies based on the nature of the project. For example, an investment in replacement capital would have a lower hurdle rate than growth capital. Capital returns has always been an important metric to managing the business, both historically and in the future. 
We ended our quarter with $7 billion in cash and are targeting over $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '22, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels. We continue to focus on thoughtful capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares totaling roughly $550 million and are targeting approximately 1 million additional shares for the balance of the year. In addition, we plan to make a $500 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan this year. 
We are lowering our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect our first quarter results, which were lower than our expectations. As we look to the rest of the fiscal year, we expect certain factors to extend longer than we originally forecast in June. So for fiscal '22, we are now forecasting earnings per share of $18.25 to $19.50 before the mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment and earnings per share of $19.75 to $21 before the mark-to-market adjustments and excluding estimated TNT integration expenses and costs associated with business realignment activities. And our effective tax rate projection is approximately 24%, again, prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. 
While our outlook reflects more uncertainty moving forward, it represents adjusted year-over-year EPS growth ranging from approximately 9% to 15.5% following our record fiscal 2021. 
As you all know, we are navigating an inherently uncertain macro environment and managing several unknowns: the pace, shape and timing of global economic recovery given the dynamics of the pandemic, including the spread and response to new and existing COVID variants, the uneven nature of global government restrictions, disruptions to global supply chains and, of course, recovery in labor availability. Our forecast assumes continued growth in U.S. industrial production and global trade, a gradual improvement in labor availability, current fuel price expectations and existing tax regulations. 
With respect to labor, we are assuming that the combination of these actions we are taking that Raj outlined, combined with a steady increase in labor availability as we turn into calendar '22, will allow us to add team members which will drive improvement in our efficiency, productivity and cost structure. 
While we are not providing specific second quarter EPS guidance, I do want to highlight a few key assumptions within our outlook. Overall, for the second quarter, we anticipate a similar level of headwinds in Q2 as we experienced in the first quarter as the challenges and impacts to our operations from the labor shortages are expected to persist through the rest of calendar 2021. Consistent with the first quarter, we also expect headwinds in Q2 to be driven by our expansion of ground, higher health care expenses, COVID-related air network inefficiencies at Express and the benefit in the prior year of reduced aviation excise taxes. That said, while these headwinds will persist in the second quarter, we expect strong performance in the second half of fiscal '22. We remain confident that our long-term strategies will allow us to realize the benefits of growth investments in the future. 
And next, we'll be happy to address your questions."

In fact, the Minneapolis Fed noted that firms in every sector reported difficulty in attracting labor, and that 68% of the Fortune 100 companies address supply chain and labor disruptions over the past quarter. 
So the situation is very complex, not just the availability of workers, workers impacted by safety concerns with COVID, of course, the very real issue of child care. And our labor markets and border economy cannot function properly and if schools and daycares cannot stay open. So our approach to our teams and our people-first culture, combined with the flexible operating model in ground, has positioned us to remain competitive in this market. And we are highly confident that the actions we are taking to address the shortage, as I outlined in my prepared remarks. 
Let me just also add that we are very confident in our strategy. I mean where the market is growing, we have a differentiated value proposition. We have a network, an operating model that makes it good for us to succeed, and so we are confident in the long-term strategy here. And so Mike said, we expect to see the new calendar year, the labor availability continue to recover, Mike?"

So look, we fully recognize that the first quarter wasn't what we anticipated. We've taken a number of actions to address that. We will continue to identify further actions, but I will fully say if the circumstances don't change as we identify here, we absolutely would need to revisit the pace of the plans that we have. But the strategies are sound, but we would absolutely need to think about the pace of things given the environment that we're operating in.

I think the frustrating part from an investor perspective, you guys have definitely seen pretty substantial growth in the past decade, definitely put the capital behind that, but margins are actually lower now than they were prior peak. Returns have obviously come down, and we do hear lots of bold actions how to sustain forward growth. But I guess I'm going to ask the question just the same way. Like what is being done in a bold way to improve returns and profitability across all these networks? And is there a way to look back to say, hey, we've been investing in the 777 and 767, yet Express margins aren't showing most traction? How do we review those prior plans to ensure that they deliver in the future?"

If you rewind roughly 1.5 years ago, we were in the midst of talking about parking and reducing capacity in a number of our MD-11 fleet. Obviously, as the market changed radically here and there was the need for the additional capacity and the opportunity there, so we unparked those. Should things change going forward, that remains a flex lever. And it absolutely is the case that having a higher proportion of the newer, more efficient aircraft with the 767 and 777 R in the fleet will drive improved economics and margins at Express. So again, we're ongoing looking at these different network initiatives. And so that absolutely remains a long-term winner in terms of the fleet renewal, and we will continue with that.

But if I were to sort of exclude those items and look at sort of the cost inflation on the package business, the Express and Ground package, it still looks like I'm getting about 9% cost inflation on essentially flat volume. So I was wondering maybe if you could help us understand ex some of the items that you've talked about, what's driving the cost inflation at such a high level when we're not seeing the volume growth in those individual segments? And maybe do you expect that to sort of change? And do you think margins expand in both of those segments for the full year?"

So as it relates to the cost inflation and taking that category broadly, let me just clarify what's in our outlook. The network inefficiencies inherently are contributing to that cost increase that you're talking about. We expect those to mitigate and work away. In our outlook that we're giving you here, we're not assuming any change in terms of the current labor market in terms of wage rates and that. 
So just to give you an illustrative example here. A year ago, our package handlers at Ground, we are paying an hourly rate that is 16% more than previously. At our Express major sort locations, the hourly rate is north of a 25% increase. So those are the -- that is the reality of the labor market right now. And so that's -- as Brie highlighted, we are taking a number of actions to recognize and address that. Maybe if I help talk through as we go through the year here, I think maybe part of what you're -- also there. 
So again, like I said, more efficient operations as we go through the year. The pricing actions that we announced yesterday, combined with our ongoing efforts, those largely will impact the second half of the year. Raj highlighted a number of the adaptations we're making in our operating plans as well as some of the technology and other initiatives we're bringing on to execute more efficiently. And then just to tie off some aspects here, we will have some tailwinds in the second half. You may recall, we had the severe weather situation in the third quarter of last year variable comp will be a tailwind in the second half of the year, and then there was 2 other items with the frontline bonus program and then the recognition of our [ ad ] contribution.

So we're pretty confident in the volumes. 
And again, to complement what Mike shared, as a reminder, a lot of our increase -- well, our GRI will happen in January. So it will happen in the back half, which is obviously a big driver of back half performance and then a couple of things. John's got some great technology that's coming into market as we head into peak and in the back half. It's going to help us be more productive.

To be really clear, when we're talking about incremental capacity, one of the key elements of our revenue quality strategy, which has application here in the United States as well as in our Intercontinental. As we talked about it, I talked about the 6 new flights that we launched from an Asia outbound perspective. As we -- and that was primarily, quite frankly, a transition from ad hoc to scheduled service to improve reliability. But that allows us to plan and predict, and it also allows us to sell differently. As we sold into those flights versus previously, a lot of that was kind of catch-up in spot rate. We are making sure that we are bringing on customers at current rates, and we are measuring kind of those current rates. So if a customer had ex use of our intercontinental lift prior to the last 18 months, we have contractual terms there. But as we increase the capacity we give those customers, that incremental business comes on at a higher rate. 
So we're really trying to strike the right balance with our customers, give them the predictability that they need and honor our existing contractual terms as well as, as we expand capacity, give them availability to that capacity at an incremental current market rate. So really trying to strike that right balance. So that's what I was referring to. It's predominantly in the intercontinental side, but of course, it does have application from a peak perspective. As we brought on new customers this year and we look at our surging customers, they obviously -- those peak surcharges help them get the capacity they need so they can have a successful peak. I hope that helps answer your question."

So I think you're going to see some good home delivery growth. And from an economy perspective, this particular quarter, you saw the 30% year-over-year decline. I do not think you will see that trend continue. John and I are working, and we've got some really great new technology coming to market, a new feature called Sort to do Day, which is going to allow us to really move economy through the FedEx Ground system at a different pace and continue to lower the cost.

Well, Jack, first, look, let me just say because you brought up about ROIC, just -- and I'll expand a little bit about -- on the remarks I made earlier there. We're obviously referencing to our WACC when we compare our ROIC, which we put in the 7% to 9% range, which I think is consistent with what we see in many of your analysis. But when it comes to the ROIC itself, there's a number of different approaches and methods that practitioners use, so there tends to be variability in the absolute as well as the comparative measurements. But that said, we're revisiting the various aspects of that so that we can maybe expand the context around our discussion on the topic. But I will say regardless of how you calculate it, our ROIC does remain above our WACC. 
So you asked about the LTI plan. Look, I'm not going to speak on behalf of the Board, but I will give you some context around -- partly about what I mentioned to 3 months ago. So again, we had record earnings in fiscal '21 amidst the unprecedented global pandemic and delivering the life-saving vaccines around the world. And we've talked about the radical changes in supply chains, customer expectations and all that. So we did indeed accelerate purposely some investment opportunities for capacity expansion and, of course, the replacement of the aircraft I mentioned before. 
So as I did specifically say on the June call, the FY '22 to '24 LTI plan was set at 8% to account for these opportunities, and that target is below our historical capital intensity. Fiscal '21 was 7%, but that was the lowest in 10 years. So again, there's absolutely the focus on returns, and I think that -- we will continue to address your considerations there. 
And I would also highlight because there was a question earlier about ground and investment there, we're making returns there. We talked a lot about how we're utilizing our assets differently, more efficiently, investing in smaller units of capacity. We had the one single hub, but there's no other hubs on the drawing board. The Ground can generate a higher ROIC at different margin levels than it did, call it, 8, 9 years ago. So again, that absolutely factors into how we look at these things."

Number one, when we think about our international business, our largest growth opportunity is Europe. So when we think about what are we doing to gain share, well, first and foremost, we're going to complete the physical integration, which is obviously critical. But when I think about Europe, there's 3 lines of business. 
There's the intra-Europe. We bought TNT. It has a very comprehensive and very unique value proposition because it's got the parcel and the freight network into Europe to grow our cross-border business, and we're very pleased with the momentum there. From an international perspective, late last fiscal year, we expanded our intercontinental value proposition between Europe in the United States. We now have 90% of businesses in EU 17, have access with the fastest overnight service into the United States. So we have the leading intercontinental value proposition from Europe to the U.S. It's a great bundle to sell to B2B or commercial customers, sell the intra-Europe as well as the intercontinental. And then thirdly, when I think about Europe is we are absolutely underpenetrated in e-commerce, both within Europe as well as from Europe to the United States. And we, as I talked about, have launched the FIC product, which is really a very competitive product. It's got quick transit times that has very different features of service for the last mile. So it allows us to lower our cost to serve because the features on the last mile delivery looks a lot more like the ground domestic network. So that's our primary focus from a Europe perspective. 
I will say we are also underpenetrated between Asia and Europe, and we've got great momentum in that lane. Similar metrics, we have sped up our service into Europe from Asia. In addition to that, we are launching the FICP product between those countries. Obviously, Asia into Europe is a very large e-commerce market. And again, we're underpenetrated there. Really pleased with the momentum of our FICP product. So I hope that helps clarify. 
I also wanted to go back. I just looked at my notes. Commercial and home delivery here in the United States as we think about the rest of the fiscal year are going to be neck and neck from a growth perspective. So as I talked about commercial growing faster than home delivery, they're going to be pretty darn close as we look at the volume growth this year."

First and foremost, I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to our global team members who continue to deliver for our customers in an exceptionally challenging operating environment. We are extremely proud and grateful for the manner in which Team FedEx continues to move the world forward. 
The execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services despite the disruptive impact of the pandemic to labor availability, industry capacity and global supply chains. As we look at our first quarter results, our performance was highlighted by double-digit increases in yield across all our transportation businesses driven by limited capacity, high demand and our revenue management strategy. 
The impact of constrained labor markets remains the biggest issue facing our business, as with many other companies around the world, and was a key driver of our lower-than-expected results in the first quarter. As Mike will share in more detail momentarily, we estimate that the impact of labor shortages on our quarterly results was approximately $450 million, primarily at FedEx Ground. 
Labor shortages have had 2 distinct impacts on our business. The competition for talent, particularly for our frontline workers, have driven wage rates higher and pay premiums higher. While wage rates are higher, the more significant impact is the widespread inefficiencies in our operation from constrained labor markets. 
To illustrate this, I'd like to share a brief example from FedEx Ground. Our Portland, Oregon hub is running with approximately 65% of the staffing needed to handle its normal volume. This staffing shortage has a pronounced impact on the operations, which results in our teams diverting 25% of the volume that would normally flow to this hub because it simply cannot be processed efficiently to meet our service standards. And in this case, the volume that's diverted must be rerouted and processed which drives inefficiencies in our operations and, in turn, higher costs. These inefficiencies included adding incremental line haul and delivery routes, meaning more miles driven and a higher use of third-party transportation to enable us to bypass Portland entirely. 
Now that's merely one example. Across the FedEx Ground network there are more than 600,000 packages a day being rerouted. We anticipate the cost pressures from network inefficiencies, such as the one I just illustrated, to persist through peak as we navigate the labor market and impacts of new COVID waves. 
Overcoming these staffing and retention challenges is our utmost priority as they not only affect our cost structures and operational efficiency but also having a negative impact on service levels. As such, we are taking bold action across the enterprise to hire and invest in our frontline team members as we prepare for the peak season ahead. These actions include targeted pay premiums, particularly for weekend shifts; increased tuition reimbursement; sponsorship of a National Hiring Day on September 23 as we seek to hire 90,000 additional positions ahead of peak; detailed volume and demand planning with customers to drive additional sorts to alleviate congestion; and expanding network capacity, which I will touch on shortly. 
Based on these actions, combined with our expectations for improving labor conditions, we do anticipate gradual improvement in our operational efficiency as we turn into the new calendar year. 
During the first quarter, the team continued to execute on our strategy even amid the challenging operating environment. As e-commerce drives higher demand, we continue to strategically invest in our network to boost daily package volume capacity, increase efficiencies and further enhance the speed and service capabilities of our networks. Our investments continued in Q1 as FedEx Ground expanded its physical footprint with a new state-of-the-art hub in Chino, California, which began operations in August. This fully automated hub includes large package sortation, has the capability to process up to 30,000 packages per hour and strategically located to help address ongoing port congestion challenges. FedEx Ground also continues to see year-over-year improvement in last mile efficiency driven by a 2.4% increase of packages delivered per hour compared to Q1 last year, thanks to route optimization technology. 
As we move into Q2, we are meticulously planning for peak season ahead, including close collaboration with customers to build solutions to enable them to succeed. We expect to have substantially higher ground capacity in this peak season due to our investments in FedEx Ground's infrastructure. This includes the addition of more than a dozen new automated facilities and several other sortation equipment expansions in addition to the Chino hub that I already mentioned. 
Several key technology projects are also slated for completion this fall, including the modernization of multiple sortation, transportation management and safety systems, which will help to increase Ground's network capacity by hundreds of thousands of ADV as well as its flexibility and resiliency. This brings a total capacity increase of more than 1 million average daily volume compared to last peak. 
Another significant opportunity in our growth strategy is the improvement in the profitability of our international express operations. We reached a significant agreement with the social partners at our LiÃ¨ge express operations regarding the intended European air network transformation. This is an important milestone in the completion of the air network integration, which remains on track for completion in spring 2022. That will bring the physical network integration of TNT into FedEx to a close and, when combined with the benefits of our previously announced European restructuring, provides significant upside in our international profitability moving forward. 
In summary, we are taking bold actions in the short term to navigate through this highly uncertain environment. We remain committed to long-term shareholder return, and we are very confident in our strategy for the following reasons. We have a differentiated portfolio of services to attack the fast-growing e-commerce market. 
Our business model gives us the framework to be very successful in this regard. In fact, we are working strategically with several retailers to deliver a win-win-win solution: win for the retailer, win for the end consumer and win for FedEx. For instance, we recently partnered with a large retailer to create a common data platform that drives optimization of our combined assets and enhancement of visibility and predictability to the end customer. Further, as the day-definite residential volumes grow in our network, there's increasing opportunity to collaborate across our operating companies to improve efficiency by better utilizing our assets. Another upside for FedEx is international. Hence, the completion of our physical integration in Europe provides an inflection point for profitable growth. And finally, we are in the early stages of unlocking value from digital innovation. We are confident that this will play a significant part in the success of FedEx for years to come as we make supply chains work smarter for everyone. 
Our strategy is sound and positions us well for improved returns as we move through fiscal year '22 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brie."
124423,1671945881,2399877,"FedEx Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone.

Our first quarter commercial results were very strong with 14% revenue growth and double-digit yield improvement in our transportation segments. These results reflect the positive backdrop for growth in the parcel market, including a very healthy pricing environment. 
For fiscal year '22, FedEx revenue was forecasted to pass $90 billion. Further, we are forecasting that the U.S. parcel market will grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, which is year-over-year growth of 12%. These market projections are slightly lower than last quarter as e-commerce percentage as a percentage of retail declined. We saw a shift to in-store shopping and buy online, pick up in store. And spending and services, of course, increased. However, despite this moderate change in e-commerce growth, the secular trend of e-commerce growing as a percentage of retail will continue to drive healthy parcel market growth. We are forecasting a 10% annual growth rate of U.S. domestic market volumes through 2026. 
At FedEx, in the first quarter, total U.S. domestic package volumes increased year-over-year by 1.5%. At Express, our total U.S. domestic package volume grew 7% year-over-year. Total FedEx Ground volumes were relatively flat in the quarter. However, I'm very proud as we proactively managed our capacity for higher-yielding commercial and home delivery services. In fact, FedEx Ground commercial volumes grew double digits in the quarter. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year '22, FedEx's total U.S. domestic residential package volume mix was 57% versus 62% a year ago. U.S. B2B mix improved year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 as B2B volumes continue to recover with inventory replenishment and manufacturing rebounding as the economy opens. B2C mix continues to remain higher, however, than pre-pandemic levels. 
In Q1, FedEx Freight revenue increased 23%, driven both by increased volume and higher revenue quality, a huge shout-out to the FedEx Freight team. Great job, team. FedEx Freight Direct continues to create incredible momentum. 
Turning now to our revenue quality strategy. The continued constrained capacity in both the U.S. domestic and international markets has led to a very favorable pricing environment. We are focused on protecting and growing volume in high-yielding commercial segments, including commercial ground and small and medium segments. We have an incremental opportunity to improve large customer yields through contract renewals and providing large customers an ability to procure incremental capacity at current market rates. 
As announced yesterday, effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9%, while FedEx Freight rates will increase by an average of 5.9% to 7.9%. We also announced other surcharge increases, which can be found on fedex.com. These increases will help us continue to balance capacity with demand and mitigate the impact from the increased cost that Raj just outlined.
Turning now to international. We are forecasting the air cargo market to be more than $80 billion by calendar year 2025. At FedEx, we currently have single-digit market share. And as such, this remains a significant growth opportunity for us to continue to pursue. We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022. A full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. 
Global air cargo capacity continued to recover in July. It is still down 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Capacity on international lanes remains scarce, and we have seen European and APAC export demand recover to pre-pandemic levels. Globally, we continue our efforts to optimize our network and customer mix. We managed to a very high percentage of priority service on our international flights with yield per package improvement of 11% for international parcel and yield per pound improvement of 18% for international freight. 
Exports from Asia are fueled by the strong demand from B2C and B2B recovery. B2B will further benefit from a shift in demand from ocean freight to air cargo as our customers replenish stock levels in time for the peak sales season. To provide access to reliable capacity in this constrained environment, we turned 6 previously ad hoc intercontinental flights into scheduled service to fiscal year quarter 1: 4 Transpacific and 2 for the Asia-Europe lane. We are seeing a strong recovery in Europe as well with the overall economic recovery back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Our intra-Europe cross-border B2B volumes have recovered to pre-COVID levels. Our growth is further accelerated by significant B2C parcel volumes. E-commerce growth will be critical for both our Asian and European businesses. In Q1, we expanded FedEx International Connect Plus from Europe to 6 new global destinations, increasing coverage to 82% of global GDP across a total of 300 lanes. And on September 1, we launched FICP in EMEA across 80 origin destination lanes. For businesses looking for a cost-effective solution with competitive transit, FICP provides a compelling e-commerce value proposition. We continue to gain new customers through FICP and have a very robust sales pipeline. 
In summary, while it continues to be a very dynamic market, we remain incredibly confident in our global growth potential and our world-class commercial teams to bring in market-leading yields. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks."
124423,1671945881,2399877,"FedEx Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter FY '22 adjusted earnings per share of $4.37 was negatively impacted by approximately $800 million in year-over-year headwinds. And while Raj covered the operational impacts of these challeng",1296,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter FY '22 adjusted earnings per share of $4.37 was negatively impacted by approximately $800 million in year-over-year headwinds. And while Raj covered the operational impacts of these challenges, I will detail the financial impacts to the quarter. 
Of these headwinds, the difficult labor market had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $450 million in additional year-over-year cost, the majority of which impacted our FedEx Ground business. As we look into the impact of labor cost in the business, I want to break this impact into 2 components: higher wages and the impact of network inefficiencies. 
Of the $450 million, we estimate that $200 million was incurred in higher wage and purchase transportation rates. This included higher wage rates and pay premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services. In addition to the higher wage rates, we estimate that network inefficiencies of approximately $250 million contributed to the total impact of labor shortages on the business. These costs include additional line haul, higher usage of third-party transportation, cost to reposition assets in the network, overtime and recruiting incentives, all to address staffing shortages. 
Beyond the labor impacts, our results for the first quarter also included the following headwinds: an additional $135 million in health care costs due to lower utilization a year ago; $85 million related to investments in the Ground network, which represents the cost of bringing online 16 new automated facilities and expansions at 100 facilities, which are critical to improving service and adding capacity to meet growth for peak and beyond; and at Express, we had an estimated $60 million in incremental air network costs due to the impact of COVID restrictions on our operations, including limitations on layovers, supplemental crews to ensure service continuity and immigration restrictions. In addition, and as a reminder, our prior year results at Express included a pretax benefit of $65 million from a reduction in aviation excise taxes. 
That said, our first quarter results did come in lower than our own expectations as difficult labor conditions persisted throughout the quarter. As a result of that, variable compensation was not an expense headwind in the first quarter. 
With that overview of the consolidated results, let's turn to the highlights for the segments. At Express, results declined due to the higher operating expenses from staffing challenges and COVID-related air network impacts I discussed. Profitability was also impacted by fewer charter flights compared to the surge last spring during the early months of the pandemic. 
While we've covered the impacts to Ground results in detail, I would like to call your attention to an enhancement in our reporting included in the release and the 10-Q. As a result of business growth and our unmatched 7-day operating network at Ground, we are now providing additional product level disclosures for average daily package volume. Beginning with our first quarter, we are breaking out ADV statistics for FedEx Ground commercial, home delivery and economy services. 
Turning to Freight. We reported a record operating margin of 17.3% for the quarter as our continued focus on revenue quality and profitable growth drove average daily shipments up 12% and revenue per shipment increased 11%, as Brie highlighted previously. 
Now turning to capital spending. During the first quarter, we spent $1.6 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital and IT platforms. Our capital forecast for fiscal '22 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue and includes the following key elements. First, more than 50% increase in capital spending at Ground year-over-year for capacity expansion and new facilities to capture opportunities from growing e-commerce business. And second, fleet modernization in Express with continued investment in 767 and 777 aircraft, which not only has a high financial return but is an important part of the strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. 
In evaluating capital investments, our return on invested capital on existing capital and new projects is a critical metric to managing our business, and we have a rigorous approval process in place on all new capital projects. As we look at investments, we set the internal rate of return hurdle above our weighted average cost of capital, which varies based on the nature of the project. For example, an investment in replacement capital would have a lower hurdle rate than growth capital. Capital returns has always been an important metric to managing the business, both historically and in the future. 
We ended our quarter with $7 billion in cash and are targeting over $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '22, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels. We continue to focus on thoughtful capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares totaling roughly $550 million and are targeting approximately 1 million additional shares for the balance of the year. In addition, we plan to make a $500 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan this year. 
We are lowering our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect our first quarter results, which were lower than our expectations. As we look to the rest of the fiscal year, we expect certain factors to extend longer than we originally forecast in June. So for fiscal '22, we are now forecasting earnings per share of $18.25 to $19.50 before the mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment and earnings per share of $19.75 to $21 before the mark-to-market adjustments and excluding estimated TNT integration expenses and costs associated with business realignment activities. And our effective tax rate projection is approximately 24%, again, prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. While our outlook reflects more uncertainty moving forward, it represents adjusted year-over-year EPS growth ranging from approximately 9% to 15.5% following our record fiscal 2021. 
As you all know, we are navigating an inherently uncertain macro environment and managing several unknowns. The pace, shape and timing of global economic recovery given the dynamics of the pandemic, including the spread and response to new and existing COVID variants, the uneven nature of global government restrictions, disruptions to global supply chains and, of course, recovery in labor availability. Our forecast assumes continued growth in U.S. industrial production and global trade, a gradual improvement in labor availability, current fuel price expectations and existing tax regulations. 
With respect to labor, we are assuming that the combination of these actions we are taking that Raj outlined, combined with a steady increase in labor availability as we turn into calendar '22, will allow us to add team members which will drive improvement in our efficiency, productivity and cost structure. 
While we are not providing specific second quarter EPS guidance, I do want to highlight a few key assumptions within our outlook. Overall, for the second quarter, we anticipate a similar level of headwinds in Q2 as we experienced in the first quarter as the challenges and impacts to our operations from the labor shortages are expected to persist through the rest of calendar 2021. Consistent with the first quarter, we also expect headwinds in Q2 to be driven by our expansion of Ground, higher health care expenses, COVID-related air network inefficiencies at Express and the benefit in the prior year of reduced aviation excise taxes. 
That said, while these headwinds will persist in the second quarter, we expect strong performance in the second half of fiscal '22. We remain confident that our long-term strategies will allow us to realize the benefits of growth investments in the future. 
And next, we'll be happy to address your questions."

In fact, the Minneapolis Fed noted that firms in every sector reported difficulty in attracting labor and that 68% of the Fortune 100 companies addressed supply chain and labor disruptions over the past quarter. So the situation is very complex, not just the availability of workers, workers impacted by safety concerns with COVID and, of course, the very real issue of child care. And our labor markets and broader economy cannot function properly if schools and daycares cannot stay open. So our approach to our teams and our people-first culture, combined with the flexible operating model in Ground, has positioned us to remain competitive in this market and we are highly confident at the actions we are taking to address the shortage, as I outlined in my prepared remarks. 
However, let me just also add that we are very confident in our strategy. I mean where the market is growing, we have a differentiated value proposition.

Mike, helpful to kind of run through a number of the items that were impacting the quarter. But if I were to sort of exclude those items and look at sort of the cost inflation on the package business, the Express and Ground package, it still looks like I'm getting about 9% cost inflation on essentially flat volume. So I was wondering maybe if you could help us understand, ex some of the items that you've talked about, what's driving the cost inflation at such a high level when we're not seeing the volume growth in those individual segments. And maybe do you expect that to sort of change? And do you think margins expand in both of those segments for the full year?"

So as it relates to the cost inflation and taking that category broadly, let me just clarify what's in our outlook. The network inefficiencies inherently are contributing to that cost increase that you're talking about. We expect those to mitigate and work away. In our outlook that we're giving you here, we're not assuming any change in terms of the current labor market, in terms of wage rates in that. So just to give you an illustrative example here. A year ago, our package handlers at Ground, we are paying an hourly rate that is 16% more than previously. At our Express major sort locations, the hourly rate is north of a 25% increase. So those are the -- that is the reality of the labor market right now. And so thus, as Brie highlighted, we are taking a number of actions to recognize and address that. Maybe if I help talk through as we go through the year here, I think maybe part of what you're -- are also there. 
So again, like I said, more efficient operations as we go through the year. The pricing actions that we announced yesterday, combined with our ongoing efforts, those largely will impact the second half of the year. Raj highlighted a number of the adaptations we're making in our operating plans as well as some of the technology and other initiatives we're bringing on to execute more efficiently. And then just to tie off some aspects here, we will have some tailwinds in the second half. You may recall, we had the severe weather situation in the third quarter of last year. Variable comp will be a tailwind in the second half of the year. And then there was 2 other items with the frontline bonus program and then the recognition of our yield contribution. So trying to put all that in context for you there. 
Raj, anything you want to add?"

We have to put that in perspective. And we have record high volumes within the network right now. As we look towards peak, we're going to see growth on what was a tremendous growth at peak last year. So we're pretty confident in the volumes. 
And again, to complement what Mike shared, as a reminder, a lot of our increase -- well, our GRI will happen in January. So it will happen in the back half, which is obviously a big driver of back-half performance, and then a couple of things. John's got some great technology that's coming into market. As we head into peak and in the back half, it's going to help us be more productive. And Karen Reddington and the Europe team has some incredible work going on as they finalize the integration of the air network, and we've got some other work going on there to improve European profitability.

And we have made sure that we are not constraining growth in our highest profitable segments. That's small and medium, and that's our commercial. And you saw those strong commercial numbers that I referenced earlier. So I would say, number one, we're confident in the secular growth opportunity for FedEx. Two, we feel we've been gaining share.

To be really clear, when we're talking about incremental capacity, one of the key elements of our revenue quality strategy, which has application here in the United States as well as in our intercontinental. As we talked about it, I talked about the 6 new flights that we launched from an Asia outbound perspective. And that was primarily, quite frankly, a transition from ad hoc to scheduled service to improve reliability. But that allows us to plan and predict, and it also allows us to sell differently. As we sold into those flights versus previously, a lot of that was kind of catch-up in spot rate. We are making sure that we are bringing on customers at current rates, and we are measuring kind of those current rates. So if a customer had ex use of our intercontinental lift prior to the last 18 months, we have contractual terms there. But as we increase the capacity we give those customers, that incremental business comes on at a higher rate. 
So we're really trying to strike the right balance with our customers, give them the predictability that they need and honor our existing contractual terms as well as, as we expand capacity, give them availability to that capacity at an incremental current market rate, so really trying to strike that right balance. So that's what I was referring to. It's predominantly in the intercontinental side but, of course, it does have application from a peak perspective. As we brought on new customers this year and we look at our surging customers, they obviously -- those peak surcharges help them get the capacity they need so they can have a successful peak. I hope that helps answer your question."

So I think you're going to see some good home delivery growth. 
And from an economy perspective, this particular quarter, you saw the 30% year-over-year decline. I do not think you will see that trend continue.

Can you talk about why it makes sense to raise your long-term capital spending plans when the business still isn't achieving the long-term targets you've set for it from a margin perspective? Just help us square those 2 things. I think that's an issue that a lot of people are having trouble justifying."

Well, Jack, first, look, let me just say because you brought up about ROIC, and I'll expand a little bit on the remarks I made earlier there. We're obviously referencing to our WACC when we compare our ROIC, which we put in the 7% to 9% range,",386,"All right. Well, Jack, first, look, let me just say because you brought up about ROIC, and I'll expand a little bit on the remarks I made earlier there. We're obviously referencing to our WACC when we compare our ROIC, which we put in the 7% to 9% range, which I think is consistent with what we see in many of your analysis. But when it comes to the ROIC itself, there's a number of different approaches and methods that practitioners use, so there tends to be variability in the absolute as well as the comparative measurements. But that said, we're revisiting the various aspects of that so that we can maybe expand the context around our discussion on the topic. But I will say regardless of how you calculate it, our ROIC does remain above our WACC. 
So you asked about the LTI plan. Look, I'm not going to speak on behalf of the Board, but I will give you some context around -- partly about what I mentioned, too, 3 months ago. So again, we had record earnings in fiscal '21 amidst the unprecedented global pandemic and delivering the life-saving vaccines around the world. And we've talked about the radical changes in supply chains, customer expectations and all that. So we did indeed accelerate purposely some investment opportunities for capacity expansion and, of course, the replacement of the aircraft I mentioned before. So as I did specifically say on the June call, the FY '22 to '24 LTI plan was set at 8% to account for these opportunities. And that target is below our historical capital intensity. Fiscal '21 was 7%, but that was the lowest in 10 years. So again, there's absolutely the focus on returns, and I think that we will continue to address your considerations there. 
And I would also highlight, because there was a question earlier about Ground and investment there, we're making returns there. We talked a lot about how we're utilizing our assets differently, more efficiently, investing in smaller units of capacity. We had the one single hub, but there's no other hubs on the drawing board. Ground can generate a higher ROIC at different margin levels than it did, call it, 8, 9 years ago. So again, that absolutely factors into how we look at these things."

Number one, when we think about our international business, our largest growth opportunity is Europe. So when we think about what are we doing to gain share, well, first and foremost, we're going to complete the physical integration, which is obviously critical. But when I think about Europe, there's 3 lines of business. There's the intra-Europe. We bought TNT. It has a very comprehensive and very unique value proposition because it's got the parcel and the freight network intra-Europe to grow our cross-border business, and we're very pleased with the momentum there. 
From an international perspective, late last fiscal year, we expanded our intercontinental value proposition between Europe in the United States. We now have 90% of businesses in EU, 17 have access with the fastest overnight service into the United States. So we have the leading intercontinental value proposition from Europe to the U.S. It's a great bundle to sell to B2B or commercial customers, sell to intra-Europe as well as the intercontinental. And then thirdly, when I think about Europe is we are absolutely underpenetrated in e-commerce, both within Europe as well as from Europe to the United States. And we, as I talked about, have launched the FICP product, which is really a very competitive product. It's got quick transit times that has very different features of service for the last mile. So it allows us to lower our cost to serve because the features on the last mile delivery look a lot more like the ground domestic network. So that's our primary focus from a Europe perspective. 
I will say we are also underpenetrated between Asia and Europe, and we've got great momentum in that lane. Similar metrics, we have sped up our service into Europe from Asia. In addition to that, we are launching the FICP product between those countries. Obviously, Asia into Europe is a very large e-commerce market. And again, we're underpenetrated there, really pleased with the momentum of our FICP product. So I hope that helps clarify. I also wanted to go back, I just looked at my notes, commercial and home delivery here in the United States, as we think about the rest of the fiscal year, are going to be neck and neck from a growth perspective. So as I talked about commercial growing faster than home delivery, they're going to be pretty darn close as we look at the volume growth this year."

Let me begin by extending a heartfelt thank you to our more than 600,000 dedicated team members, especially those on the frontlines or working relentlessly to successfully deliver another robust peak season",1282,"Thank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by extending a heartfelt thank you to our more than 600,000 dedicated team members, especially those on the frontlines or working relentlessly to successfully deliver another robust peak season for our customers. 
As expected, we are seeing strong levels of volume in our network given unprecedented levels of shopping and shipping this holiday season. FedEx Ground had an outstanding Cyber Week, with 100 million packages picked up during the first official week of peak. Our ability to handle this influx of packages has been years in the making as we've taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network to support customers, large and small. This includes strategically adding more capacity across our network to support our growing customer base. 
For example, at FedEx Ground, this means adding 14.4 million square feet to our network, the equivalent of 300 football fields since June of this year. In Q2 alone, we brought online 24 major expansion projects, with 9 of them starting operations in November just weeks before peak. While it was important that these facilities were up and running to add to capacity in time for peak, experience tells us that they will operate with increasing efficiency in the weeks and months ahead. 
As we shared on the Q1 call, overcoming staffing and retention challenges due to the constrained labor market has been a key focus. We continued to take bold actions in Q2 to hire and invest in our frontline team members and thus increase network efficiency. These actions included pay premiums, increased paid time off and tuition reimbursement. 
I'm pleased to share that we have made considerable traction in recruiting frontline positions. Last week, we exceeded 111,000 applications, the highest level in FedEx history. To put this in perspective, we had 52,000 applications the week of May 8. This has led to appropriate staffing levels of peak, including having more than 60,000 frontline team members since we last spoke in September. 
We delivered strong results for the quarter with an 11% increase in adjusted operating income, which exceeded our initial expectations shared during the Q1 call. Second quarter results include outstanding performance by our team at FedEx Express, where operating income on an as-adjusted basis exceeded $1 billion for the quarter. The ability we have an Express to flex our cost structure and network in response to changing market conditions positions us for long-term sustained profitability. 
FedEx Freight also delivered a strong quarter with an operating margin of 14.7%. I'm proud of the team as they continue to focus on revenue quality and profitable growth. 
We estimate the effect of labor shortages on our Q2 results was approximately $470 million, in line with our original expectations. And consistent with the first quarter, Ground once again bore the majority of these costs to the tune of $285 million. 
While Ground's results were negatively affected by labor challenges in the first half of the year, we are encouraged by hiring momentum as we look to the second half and are focused on retaining recently hired team members after the peak season concludes. We know we have an excellent value proposition for employees, which we are strengthening even further with technology that enables employee-friendly, flexible schedule options, including the ability to pick up extra shifts when convenient or swap shifts with their colleague all from the convenience of an app on their phone or computer. All of this to say we anticipate cost pressures from constrained labor markets to partially subside in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Now it's a good time to focus on what is ahead for FedEx. The FedEx business has been built over nearly 5 decades. And during that time, we have built networks and capabilities that are differentiated from our competitors and nearly impossible to replicate. Our customers and their customers value these networks and capabilities as we enable global supply chains to stay connected. This has never been illustrated more clearly than during the last 2 years of the global COVID pandemic. Our industry has proven to be absolutely critical in delivering during this pandemic, whether it is business-to-business or e-commerce. And within this industry, our strategy is unique. Our future growth and profitability will be driven by our strategy, and we will drive total shareholder value over the immediate, mid- and long term. There is solid momentum in our base business as we continue to lean into the dynamic growth of e-commerce amid a robust pricing environment. 
In addition, we have other levers for profitable growth, including: number one, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks and business; number two, driving improved results in Europe and international; and number three, unlocking value by digital innovation. 
Our expanded collaboration across operating companies will drive cost benefits, lower delivery and linehaul costs and better utilization of existing assets. Said differently, we'll utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter, more calculated manner. 
FedEx Freight trucks have traveled 4 million miles while operating on behalf of FedEx Ground this year. FedEx Freight has also provided FedEx Ground with intermodal containers, which have already been discussed nearly 50,000 times. We will look -- continue to look comprehensively at all assets in our network, including stations, hubs and equipment to put the right package in the right network at the best service for our customers. And as I highlighted earlier, the focus on collaboration also extends to our customers as we work to make their supply chains smarter. This includes providing integration and common data platform opportunities and planning the best way to leverage our network flexibility for their volume needs. 
The second lever is continuing to improve our international profitability. Our international business, particularly Europe, remains one of our biggest opportunities. I was in Europe in October, and I was happy to note the excellent progress there as we build upon the success of station integration, which was completed in May 2021. We remain on track for the completion of our air network integration in April 2022, which will complete the physical integration of TNT into FedEx Express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks. 
After April 2022, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport will serve as the main hub for all European and intercontinental flights. Liege will connect specific large European markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth. Brie will share more on what this enhanced value proposition means for our customers. 
Finally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation and our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies and enhanced digital capabilities ranging from increased network efficiency to customer experience improvements. For example, early package visibility enhances visibility of third-party trailers as improving customer collaboration, information sharing and package prioritization. 
Model-driven estimated delivery date uses machine learning to provide a more accurate estimated delivery day of packages to customers and recipients. 
And trailer load scan automation eliminates the need for a manual scan enabling faster and more efficient loading while significantly reducing package touches. 
These ongoing investments, network capacity, automation and technology, have helped FedEx build the most flexible and most responsive network in the industry, affording us significant competitive advantages. 
In closing, the successful execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services. We remain confident in these strategies for the various reasons outlined. Our unparalleled portfolio of services powered by the strength and reach of our global network positions FedEx to deliver superior, sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. 
With that, let me turn the floor over to Brie."

In January, the ground economy peak surcharge will be replaced by the new ground economy delivery surcharge at $1, solidifying the price point for our economy product. And as a reminder, FedEx Ground Economy was formerly FedEx SmartPost. 
The landscape across the industry remains robust and positions us well for continued profitable growth. We are forecasting that the U.S. domestic parcel market will reach 134 million pieces a day by calendar year 2026, a remarkable 70% growth from 2020. E-commerce is expected to drive 90% of the parcel market growth. We have developed a tremendous portfolio of e-commerce solutions, and we are very confident that our competitive value proposition will enable us to continue to take share smartly in the addressable e-commerce market. As you all know, we have a diversified customer base globally as well as here in the United States. And as such, we can confidently grow without the risk of a very large and disruptive customer negotiation. 
The U.S. domestic B2B market is also expected to grow. It will grow at a 5% CAGR through 2026. We are growing our digital capabilities to provide a range of visibility experiences that will give our B2B customers greater clarity, confidence and control over their deliveries, especially in high-value verticals such as health care. 
Turning now to international. Our successful commercial and operational execution in response to COVID demonstrates our ability to grow profitably in an uncertain environment. Demand out of Asia continues to contribute strong revenue and profit performance, and our international economy embargo and peak surcharges are contributing to our yield growth there. 
Q2 Express international export yield grew 12% and volume grew 7.6%, which is outstanding year-over-year growth. International export composite yield grew to almost $54 per package, while average daily volume was more than 1.1 million. I am very proud of the international revenue quality results, especially given that we also had double-digit e-commerce growth internationally, which, of course, puts downward pressure on our package yield. 
International Priority freight had a very strong quarter with 34% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. With new variants of COVID causing uncertainty in the global recovery, we believe that air cargo capacity will remain constrained through calendar year 2022 and a full

on international lanes remains scarce. We anticipate a continued favorable pricing environment and an embargo on our deferred services out of Asia Pacific for the foreseeable future. 
We are targeting both B2B and cross-border e-commerce market share internationally. We have identified the target lanes for B2B growth where we have shared growth opportunity, most notably in and out of and across Europe. As Raj alluded to, with the launch of our integrated air network in April, we will dramatically enhance our capabilities within and into Europe, creating benefits for customers around the world. More European customers will have access to next-day and prenoon delivery times for their intra-European shipments through our expanded portfolio of services. We will be able to offer customers an option of mid-day or end-of-day service bound to Europe, giving our customers around the world more choice and flexibility while giving our global sales team more opportunities to pursue. 
These enhancements, along with our intra-Europe road services and industry-leading Europe to U.S. service, position us with a very competitive portfolio. As we approach the final stages of physical integration this fiscal year, we are increasing the FedEx brand presence on the road in Europe by approximately 30%, including the rebranding of vehicles and facilities. 
Additionally, intercontinental e-commerce will contribute approximately half of the growth in the parcel market over the next decade. FedEx International Connect Plus, which launched across Europe, Asia Pacific and the United States, enables us to compete more effectively in this growing e-commerce market. 
In addition to the improvements in our transportation portfolio, we are very focused on our digital solutions across the customer journey. We have launched our new account opening application in 8 countries with very great results. We are seeing double-digit improvement in account openings and customers opting in for My FedEx Rewards, which, of course, is the only small business loyalty program in the industry. 
We have also launched our new FedEx ship manager application in more than 100 countries. This is the primary tool for our small business segment to ship with FedEx. With the modern, easy-to-use interface, a small business can now create a label and get the package out the door more than a minute faster than they than they could previously. We will launch this new FedEx ship manager in the United States in 2022. 
In summary, we are very confident in our commercial strategies for revenue growth and yield improvement. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks."

Given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we're quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated fin",1121,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we're quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated financial results, with adjusted operating income up 11% year-over-year. While adjusted earnings per share was unchanged year-over-year, this year's effective tax rate was significantly higher as last year's earnings included a $0.71 per share discrete tax benefit from favorable guidance issued by the IRS. As we anticipated, most of the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter persisted through the second quarter, which dampened our Q2 profitability by an estimated $770 million. 
To further unpack our second quarter results, I will highlight several key drivers. The difficult labor market once again had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $470 million in additional year-over-year costs. As I did last quarter, I'll separate the effect of the labor market into 2 components: higher rates and network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages. Of the $470 million, we estimate $230 million was incurred in higher rates and purchase transportation rates. This included higher wage rates and paid premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services. We estimate network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages, increased costs by approximately $240 million. These costs include additional line haul, higher usage of third-party transportation, cost to reposition assets in the network over time and recruiting incentives all to address staffing shortages. 
Beyond the labor effects, our results for the second quarter also included the following headwinds: $90 related to investments in the ground network, as Raj outlined earlier, that are critical to improving service and adding capacity; an estimated $75 million in incremental air network costs at Express due to the continued effect of COVID restrictions on our operations; and lastly, a $70 million effect year-over-year from higher federal excise taxes as the waiver ended on December 31, 2020. 
With that overview of the consolidated results, let's turn to the highlights of the segments. Ground reported $8.3 billion in revenue, a 13% increase year-over-year, with operating margin at 5.8%. The results at Ground in the second quarter with operating income and margin down are not where we would like them to be, and our teams remain very focused on improving performance. Ground operating income was down approximately $70 million. And in addition to the $90 million I mentioned earlier, results were significantly affected by higher wage and purchase transportation rates and network inefficiencies amidst the constrained labor market. 
Express adjusted operating income increased to over $1 billion and reported an adjusted operating margin of 8.8%, which was driven by higher yields and international priority volume growth, which more than offset the negative effects of continued staffing challenges and COVID-19-related air network inefficiencies. 
Freight had another outstanding quarter with an operating margin of 14.7% as revenue for Q2 increased 17% year-over-year and operating income increased 33% year-over-year. 
Our Q2 results include a net pretax noncash mark-to-market loss of $260 million related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands pension plan and a curtailment charge related to the U.S. FedEx Freight pension plan. I'll point you to our 10-Q filed this afternoon for more details on these charges. 
Now let's pivot to capital spending. Year-to-date, we spent $3.1 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital platforms. Our capital forecast for fiscal 2022 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue. We ended our quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and are targeting approximately $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY 2022, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels. These cash flows have provided extensive flexibility as we continue to focus on balanced capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet. As a result of this flexibility, I am pleased to announce our Board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. And as part of this program, we expect to enter into a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that will be completed by the end of the fiscal year, which is on top of the $750 million of repurchases in the first half of the year. This new program highlights the tremendous confidence we have in our business and underscores our commitment to driving value for our shareholders. During Q2, we also made a $250 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan, which mitigates PBGC fees and further strengthens the funded status of our plan for our employees, and we expect to make an additional $250 million contribution in February. 
As for our FY '22 guidance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS range to $20.50 to $21.50 to reflect second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the fiscal year as well as the expected benefit from our ASR transaction. This improved outlook represents another outstanding financial year with a year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS ranging from 13% to 18%, following our strong 2021 results. 
While the second quarter exceeded our expectations, uncertainty remains across many fronts, including the labor market. We are closely monitoring developments related to the federal vaccine mandate, ongoing pandemic developments and inflation as we consider our outlook. 
Labor headwinds will persist in Q3, but the labor availability and network inefficiency component will continue to mitigate as we move through the quarter, given our progress to date and plans to address this. In addition, we do not expect a recurrence of approximately $1 billion in notable second half headwinds from a year ago that included the timing of variable compensation expense, historic severe winter weather, a onetime express frontline bonus and our commitment to the Yale Carbon Capture initiative. 
In summary, the successful execution during the second quarter of our strategies amidst a very dynamic environment gives us confidence in our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
In closing, I do want to take a moment of personal privilege here. While not on these calls, many of you are familiar with John Marino, our long-time Chief Accounting Officer, who sign our 10-Qs and 10-Ks. John has been integrally responsible for the quality and integrity of our financial information. And after 23 years with FedEx, he will retire at the end of this month. So on behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank him for his service and record of accomplishment. 
And now before we move to the Q&A, our Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, has joined us and would like to share a few words."

Let me answer that question. The supply chain constraints we're seeing today are twofold.

Now as you know, FedEx gets out traffic, a few miles downstream from the port, and that supply chain is actually flowing pretty good through the United States. Of course, we are also flying over the top and delivering high-value goods from the global economy through the system. 
We expect the supply chain constraints to stay for some time. The air cargo capacity is going to be constrained for some more time, and we are very well positioned for success here. Let me also add this point that we have the network flexibility to scale up and down. The size and scale of our network is massive for us to be able to manage the cost accordingly as well.

Here, there is a massive margin improvement opportunity, as you can talk about the rest of it. The core business is very strong. We are in the middle of a very robust market and the pricing environment. As I've said before, on the e-commerce market growth we are in the center of it. We are in the center of this ecosystem and just discuss both volume and yield opportunities. Our core B2B business is very strong. 
In addition to that, we have 3 levers. One is the ability for us to optimize across our operating companies and to make sure the light package goes in the right network and be very smart about how we spread our assets and use our capacity. The second is the turnaround opportunity or the upside opportunity, I should say, in Europe as we finish up the physical integration and to the point that Brie talked about in detail earlier. And lastly, the ability for us to deliver value for all our stakeholders from our digital innovation. There's a lot of work going on in this regard. We are sitting on so much global insights about the global supply chain every single day, and we're working with our customers to provide those insights, and there's value there as well. So there's significant opportunities to go beyond our base. Brie, do you want to add to that?"

We are making structural changes in all of our contracts as we move forward. We're just over 50% now of our customer base that we have renewed, so we still have some work to do there and some upside potential. We've also seen small business was our fastest-growing segment again last quarter. So that, of course, is a great lift from a yield perspective.

We expect that 50% of FedEx Express global PUD vehicles will be electric by 2025, rising to 100% of purchases by 2030. So we're making good progress there. We represents a very small piece of the demand, and also the cost is not where it needs to be yet. So we know that there's some fundamental research needs to be done to really address this issue, and that's part of the reason why we're investing $100 million with the Yale to create the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. And again, the initial work and focus on to offset the equivalent of carbon emissions from the aviation industry. So lots more to come here. But again, this is something we are very serious about and working with the best minds to get the answers.

What that agreement did was to allow us to deepen our trade ties with our other trading partners. And of course, given the leadership of Japan, the other participants did go forward with it. So the best way to normalize the relationships with China is to signed TPP and get a more normalized trading relationship, which China would like to then join. And on the broader issue, obviously, we feel very strongly. As our great Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, said decades ago, he and Rosebel were really the architecture of United States promoting open trade. It's when goods cross borders, armies rarely do. So the best way to keep a harmonious relationship with China is not to disconnect, to trade where we can. And that's what we support. And I'm hopeful that at the end of the day that cooler heads will prevail, and we'll join the TPP and we will try to have that constructive relationship with China. 
The reality is people forget about this, and all of the populous politics. The trade that the United States promoted in the last 30 years gave each household in the United States an increase in disposable income of about $10,000 or $11,000. I mean it was a huge benefit, an enormous tax decrease. So we are strong free traders, and we think we should stay engaged in China, and we hope the administration does that. And I, quite frankly, am optimistic because I think at the end of the day, that view will eventually prevail. Particularly in a period of labor shortage, it's impossible for the United States to manufacture all the goods that consumers in the United States want. So I hope that was helpful."

Let me begin by extending a heartfelt thank you to our more than 600,000 dedicated team members, especially those on the frontlines or working relentlessly to successfully deliver another robust peak seas",1282,"Thank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let me begin by extending a heartfelt thank you to our more than 600,000 dedicated team members, especially those on the frontlines or working relentlessly to successfully deliver another robust peak season for our customers. 
As expected, we are seeing strong levels of volume in our network given unprecedented levels of shopping and shipping this holiday season. FedEx Ground had an outstanding Cyber Week, with 100 million packages picked up during the first official week of peak. Our ability to handle this influx of packages has been years in the making as we've taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network to support customers, large and small. This includes strategically adding more capacity across our network to support our growing customer base. 
For example, at FedEx Ground, this means adding 14.4 million square feet to our network, the equivalent of 300 football fields, since June of this year. In Q2 alone, we brought online 24 major expansion projects, with 9 of them starting operations in November just weeks before peak. While it was important that these facilities were up and running to add to capacity in time for peak, experience tells us that they will operate with increasing efficiency in the weeks and months ahead. 
As we shared on the Q1 call, overcoming staffing and retention challenges due to the constrained labor market has been a key focus. We continued to take bold actions in Q2 to hire and invest in our frontline team members and thus increase network efficiency. These actions included pay premiums, increased paid time off and tuition reimbursement. 
I'm pleased to share that we have made considerable traction in recruiting frontline positions. Last week, we exceeded 111,000 applications, the highest level in FedEx history. To put this in perspective, we had 52,000 applications the week of May 8. This has led to appropriate staffing levels of peak, including hiring more than 60,000 frontline team members since we last spoke in September. 
We delivered strong results for the quarter, with an 11% increase in adjusted operating income, which exceeded our initial expectations shared during the Q1 call. Second quarter results include outstanding performance by our team at FedEx Express, where operating income on an as-adjusted basis exceeded $1 billion for the quarter. The ability we have at Express to flex our cost structure and network in response to changing market conditions positions us for long-term, sustained profitability. 
FedEx Freight also delivered a strong quarter with an operating margin of 14.7%. I'm proud of the team as they continue to focus on revenue quality and profitable growth. 
We estimate the effect of labor shortages on our Q2 results was approximately $470 million, in line with our original expectations. And consistent with the first quarter, Ground once again bore the majority of these costs to the tune of $285 million. 
While Ground's results were negatively affected by labor challenges in the first half of the year, we are encouraged by hiring momentum as we look to the second half and are focused on retaining recently hired team members after the peak season concludes. We know we have an excellent value proposition for employees, which we are strengthening even further with technology that enables employee-friendly, flexible schedule options, including the ability to pick up extra shifts when convenient or swap shifts with their colleague all from the convenience of an app on their phone or computer. All of this to say we anticipate cost pressures from constrained labor markets to partially subside in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Now it's a good time to focus on what is ahead for FedEx. The FedEx business has been built over nearly 5 decades. And during that time, we have built networks and capabilities that are differentiated from our competitors and nearly impossible to replicate. Our customers and their customers value these networks and capabilities as we enable global supply chains to stay connected. This has never been illustrated more clearly than during the last 2 years of the global COVID pandemic. Our industry has proven to be absolutely critical in delivering during this pandemic, whether it is business-to-business or e-commerce. And within this industry, our strategy is unique. Our future growth and profitability will be driven by our strategy, and we will drive total shareholder value over the immediate, mid- and long term. There is solid momentum in our base business as we continue to lean into the dynamic growth of e-commerce amid a robust pricing environment. 
In addition, we have other levers for profitable growth, including: number one, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks and business; number two, driving improved results in Europe and international; and number three, unlocking value by digital innovation. 
Our expanded collaboration across operating companies will drive cost benefits, lower delivery and linehaul costs and better utilization of existing assets. Said differently, we'll utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter, more calculated manner. 
FedEx Freight trucks have traveled 4 million miles while operating on behalf of FedEx Ground this year. FedEx Freight has also provided FedEx Ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched nearly 50,000 times. We will look -- continue to look comprehensively at all assets in our network, including stations, hubs and equipment to put the right package in the right network at the best service for our customers. And as I highlighted earlier, the focus on collaboration also extends to our customers as we work to make their supply chains smarter. This includes providing integration and common data platform opportunities and planning the best way to leverage our network flexibility for their volume needs. 
The second lever is continuing to improve our international profitability. Our international business, particularly Europe, remains one of our biggest opportunities. I was in Europe in October, and I was happy to note the excellent progress there as we built upon the success of station integration, which was completed in May 2021. We remain on track for the completion of our air network integration in April 2022, which will complete the physical integration of TNT into FedEx Express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks. 
After April 2022, Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport will serve as the main hub for all European and intercontinental flights. Liege will connect specific large European markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth. Brie will share more on what this enhanced value proposition means for our customers. 
Finally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation and our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies and enhanced digital capabilities ranging from increased network efficiency to customer experience improvements. For example, early package visibility enhances visibility of third-party trailers as improving customer collaboration, information sharing and package prioritization. Model-driven estimated delivery date uses machine learning to provide a more accurate estimated delivery day of packages to customers and recipients. And trailer load scan automation eliminates the need for a manual scan, enabling faster and more efficient loading while significantly reducing package touches. 
These ongoing investments, network capacity, automation and technology have helped FedEx build the most flexible and most responsive network in the industry, affording us significant competitive advantages. 
In closing, the successful execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services. We remain confident in these strategies for the various reasons outlined. Our unparalleled portfolio of services, powered by the strength and reach of our global network, positions FedEx to deliver superior, sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. 
With that, let me turn the floor over to Brie."
124423,1671945731,2462650,"FedEx Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 delivered our second consecutive quarter of 14% revenue growth, demonstrating the strong demand for our differentiated portfolio and our ability to drive revenue quality as a result. Constrained capacity ha",955,"Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. 
Q2 delivered our second consecutive quarter of 14% revenue growth, demonstrating the strong demand for our differentiated portfolio and our ability to drive revenue quality as a result. 
Constrained capacity has continued to support a favorable pricing environment. We are maintaining a brisk pace for repricing contracts, ensuring a high surcharge capture and yield improvements. We are working with large customers to identify opportunities to move their volume from our national networks to our regional and local networks, bringing up additional capacity for small business customers. Small businesses rely on our market-leading times and our 7-day-a-week network to compete. They cannot afford to deploy -- they cannot forward deploy inventory at the same scale as large retailers. 
Our domestic yield growth was 9.1% with fuel in Q2. Our general rate increase will take place in January, and we expect a strong capture rate. In January, the Ground Economy peak surcharge will be replaced by the new Ground Economy delivery surcharge at $1, solidifying the price point for our economy product. And as a reminder, FedEx Ground Economy was formerly FedEx SmartPost. 
The landscape across the industry remains robust and positions us well for continued profitable growth. We are forecasting that the U.S. domestic parcel market will reach 134 million pieces a day by calendar year 2026, a remarkable 70% growth from 2020. E-commerce is expected to drive 90% of the parcel market growth. We have developed a tremendous portfolio of e-commerce solutions, and we are very confident that our competitive value proposition will enable us to continue to take share smartly in the addressable e-commerce market. As you all know, we have a diversified customer base globally as well as here in the United States, and as such, we can confidently grow without the risk of a very large and disruptive customer negotiation. 
The U.S. domestic B2B market is also expected to grow. It will grow at a 5% CAGR through 2026. We are growing our digital capabilities to provide a range of visibility experiences that will give our B2B customers greater clarity, confidence and control over their deliveries, especially in high-value verticals such as health care. 
Turning now to international. Our successful commercial and operational execution in response to COVID demonstrates our ability to grow profitably in an uncertain environment. Demand out of Asia continues to contribute strong revenue and profit performance, and our international economy embargo and peak surcharges are contributing to our yield growth there. 
Q2 Express international export yield grew 12%, and volume grew 7.6% which is outstanding year-over-year growth. International export composite yield grew to almost $54 per package, while average daily volume was more than 1.1 million. I am very proud of the international revenue quality results, especially given that we also had double-digit e-commerce growth internationally, which, of course, puts downward pressure on our package yield. 
International Priority freight had a very strong quarter with 34% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. With new variants of COVID causing uncertainty in the global recovery, we believe that air cargo capacity will remain constrained through calendar year 2022 and a full recovery is not anticipated until at least 2024. 
Export demand in Europe and APAC has fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and capacity on international lanes remains scarce. We anticipate a continued favorable pricing environment and an embargo on our deferred services out of Asia Pacific for the foreseeable future. 
We are targeting both B2B and cross-border e-commerce market share internationally. We have identified the target lanes for B2B growth where we have share growth opportunity, most notably in and out of and across Europe. As Raj alluded to, with the launch of our integrated Air network in April, we will dramatically enhance our capabilities within and into Europe, creating benefits for customers around the world. 
More European customers will have access to next-day and pre-noon delivery times for their intra-European shipments through our expanded portfolio of services. We will be able to offer customers an option of mid-day or end-of-day service inbound to Europe, giving our customers around the world more choice and flexibility while giving our global sales team more opportunities to pursue. These enhancements, along with our intra-Europe road services and industry-leading Europe-to-U.S. service, position us with a very competitive portfolio. 
As we approach the final stages of physical integration this fiscal year, we are increasing the FedEx brand presence on the road in Europe by approximately 30%, including the rebranding of vehicles and facilities. Additionally, intercontinental e-commerce will contribute approximately half of the growth in the parcel market over the next decade. FedEx International Connect Plus, which launched across Europe, Asia Pacific and the United States, enables us to compete more effectively in this growing e-commerce market. 
In addition to the improvements in our transportation portfolio, we are very focused on our digital solutions across the customer journey. We have launched our new account opening application in 8 countries with very great results. We are seeing double-digit improvement in account openings and customers opting in for My FedEx Rewards, which, of course, is the only small business loyalty program in the industry. 
We have also launched our new FedEx Ship Manager application in more than 100 countries. This is the primary tool for our small business segment to ship with FedEx. With the modern, easy-to-use interface, a small business can now create a label and get the package out the door more than a minute faster than they could previously. We will launch this new FedEx Ship Manager in the United States in 2022. 
In summary, we are very confident in our commercial strategies for revenue growth and yield improvement. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks."
124423,1671945731,2462650,"FedEx Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","FedEx Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we're quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated f",1120,"Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we're quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated financial results, with adjusted operating income up 11% year-over-year. While adjusted earnings per share was unchanged year-over-year, this year's effective tax rate was significantly higher as last year's earnings included a $0.71 per share discrete tax benefit from favorable guidance issued by the IRS. As we anticipated, most of the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter persisted through the second quarter, which dampened our Q2 profitability by an estimated $770 million. 
To further unpack our second quarter results, I will highlight several key drivers. The difficult labor market once again had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $470 million in additional year-over-year costs. As I did last quarter, I'll separate the effect of the labor market into 2 components: higher rates and network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages. 
Of the $470 million, we estimate $230 million was incurred in higher rates and purchase transportation rates. This included higher wage rates and paid premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services. We estimate network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages increased costs by approximately $240 million. These costs include additional linehaul, higher usage of third-party transportation, cost to reposition assets in the network over time and recruiting incentives all to address staffing shortages. 
Beyond the labor effects, our results for the second quarter also included the following headwinds: $90 related to investments in the ground network, as Raj outlined earlier, that are critical to improving service and adding capacity; an estimated $75 million in incremental air network costs at Express due to the continued effect of COVID restrictions on our operations; and lastly, a $70 million effect year-over-year from higher federal excise taxes as the waiver ended on December 31, 2020. 
With that overview of the consolidated results, let's turn to the highlights of the segments. Ground reported $8.3 billion in revenue, a 13% increase year-over-year, with operating margin at 5.8%. The results at Ground in the second quarter, with operating income and margin down, are not where we would like them to be, and our teams remain very focused on improving performance. Ground operating income was down approximately $70 million, and in addition to the $90 million I mentioned earlier, results were significantly affected by higher wage and purchase transportation rates and network inefficiencies amidst the constrained labor market. 
Express adjusted operating income increased to over $1 billion and reported an adjusted operating margin of 8.8%, which was driven by higher yields and international priority volume growth, which more than offset the negative effects of continued staffing challenges and COVID-19-related air network inefficiencies. Freight had another outstanding quarter with an operating margin of 14.7% as revenue for Q2 increased 17% year-over-year and operating income increased 33% year-over-year. 
Our Q2 results include a net pretax noncash mark-to-market loss of $260 million related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands pension plan and a curtailment charge related to the U.S. FedEx Freight pension plan. I'll point you to our 10-Q filed this afternoon for more details on these charges. 
Now let's pivot to capital spending. Year-to-date, we spent $3.1 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital platforms. Our capital forecast for fiscal 2022 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue. We ended our quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and are targeting approximately $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY 2022, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels. These cash flows have provided extensive flexibility as we continue to focus on balanced capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet. 
As a result of this flexibility, I am pleased to announce our Board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. And as part of this program, we expect to enter into a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that will be completed by the end of the fiscal year, which is on top of the $750 million of repurchases in the first half of the year. This new program highlights the tremendous confidence we have in our business and underscores our commitment to driving value for our shareholders. During Q2, we also made a $250 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan, which mitigates PBGC fees and further strengthens the funded status of our plan for our employees, and we expect to make an additional $250 million contribution in February. 
As for our FY '22 guidance, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS range to $20.50 to $21.50 to reflect second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the fiscal year as well as the expected benefit from our ASR transaction. This improved outlook represents another outstanding financial year with a year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS ranging from 13% to 18%, following our strong 2021 results. 
While the second quarter exceeded our expectations, uncertainty remains across many fronts, including the labor market. We are closely monitoring developments related to the federal vaccine mandate, ongoing pandemic developments and inflation as we consider our outlook. 
Labor headwinds will persist in Q3, but the labor availability and network inefficiency component will continue to mitigate as we move through the quarter, given our progress to date and plans to address this. In addition, we do not expect a recurrence of approximately $1 billion in notable second half headwinds from a year ago that included the timing of variable compensation expense, historic severe winter weather, a onetime Express frontline bonus and our commitment to the Yale Carbon Capture initiative. 
In summary, the successful execution during the second quarter of our strategies amidst a very dynamic environment gives us confidence in our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
In closing, I do want to take a moment of personal privilege here. While not on these calls, many of you are familiar with John Marino, our long-time Chief Accounting Officer, who signs our 10-Qs and 10-Ks. John has been integrally responsible for the quality and integrity of our financial information, and after 23 years with FedEx, he will retire at the end of this month. So on behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank him for his service and record of accomplishment. 
And now, before we move to the Q&A, our Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, has joined us and would like to share a few words."

The supply chain constraints we're seeing today are twofold.

Now as you know, FedEx gets out traffic a few miles downstream from the port, and that supply chain is actually flowing pretty good to the United States. Of course, we are also flying over the top and delivering high-value goods from the global economy through the system. 
We expect the supply chain constraints to stay for some time. The air cargo capacity is going to be constrained for some more time, and we are very well positioned for success here. Let me also add this point that we have the network flexibility to scale up and down. The size and scale of our network is massive for us to be able to manage the cost accordingly as well.

Again, to put that in context, which is what we saw in May, that was 52,000. So you can see that we're making a lot of progress here. 
And so we are essentially staffed up for peak, and we think that we can hold on to the required labor to the second half. So the projections that we talk about now incorporate these assumptions. 
I don't know, Mike, if you want to add to that."

So first, the 3 key components for driving the second half of the year are the pricing initiatives, the labor aspects that we just covered as well as the headwinds we had second half of last year. So as Brie mentioned, we're being very thoughtful about the various pricing levers and initiatives. And recall that the GRI goes into effect in January and that the surcharges -- certain surcharges that we announced back in September -- first of those hit in November, so we only had 1 month in the second quarter. So that will hit the whole year as well as the ongoing contract renewals. So those are 3 key things to keep front and center when you're thinking about drivers for the second half of the year. 
As far as the broader guidance, overall, Q2 was above our expectations. As Raj mentioned, the labor impacts actually came in right in line with what we anticipated back in September, but we executed strongly our revenue quality initiatives, we managed and deferred the various expenses, and we were able to accommodate incremental demand, particularly from Asia Pacific. So the combination of the second quarter, our outlook for the second half of the year, and then, of course, the impact of the ASR, when you think about the pieces of the overall annual guidance change. So hopefully, that helps frame that."

So we talked about the new FedEx Ship Manager online, we've already launched that in Europe and we've had great traction with it. So when we think about kind of post April, we've got a great portfolio for B2B and we are growing in e-commerce, which has been something we haven't been able to do.

What that agreement did was to allow us to deepen our trade ties with our other trading partners. And of course, given the leadership of Japan, the other participants did go forward with it. So the best way to normalize the relationships with China is to sign TPP and gain a more normalized trading relationship, which China would like to then join. 
And on the broader issue, obviously, we feel very strongly. As our great Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, said decades ago -- he and Roosevelt were really the architects of United States promoting open trade. It's when goods cross borders, armies rarely do. So the best way to keep a harmonious relationship with China is not to disconnect, to trade where we can. And that's what we support. And I'm hopeful that at the end of the day that cooler heads will prevail, and we'll join the TPP, and we will try to have that constructive relationship with China. 
The reality is people forget about this, and all of the populous politics. The trade that the United States promoted in the last 30 years gave each household in the United States an increase in disposable income of about $10,000 or $11,000. I mean it was a huge benefit, an enormous tax decrease. 
So we are strong free traders, and we think we should stay engaged in China, and we hope the administration does that. And I, quite frankly, am optimistic because I think at the end of the day, that view will eventually prevail. Particularly in a period of labor shortage, it's impossible for the United States to manufacture all the goods that consumers in the United States want. So I hope that was helpful."

The rationale for the integration remains as sound as it was when we made the acquisition. The portfolio in Europe, we're talking about International, in and out of Europe, intercontinental, we are very strong there. Intra-European Express, we are doing pretty good. It's the intra-European and Ground business that we didn't have very minimal share. Well, with TNT, we have the best player in that business. 
Now that being part of this portfolio and we will stay very disciplined on the International domestic business, we now have the portfolio to make it successful and piece it all together, not only from a customer value proposition perspective, but also from a cost of moving International, especially economy goods on the road. 
So I hope that answered the question, but we feel that -- and also, the restructuring program that we announced earlier this calendar year is on track to make sure that we are as efficient as possible in Europe. So a lot of things going on, very excited about what April '22 brings."

Is that something that you need to price to get the margin level up? Is it getting some of the efficiencies? And how do you think about normalized incremental margins there?"
