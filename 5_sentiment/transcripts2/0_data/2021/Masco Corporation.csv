I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. 
2020 was a challenging year for all of us. As the virus started reshaping our lives, our economy and our business, we established 3 priorities to guide us throughout the year: Number one, keep our employees safe; Two, meet the needs of our customers; and three, position Masco to outperform the recovery. 
Our employees across our business units did a tremendous job to deliver on all of these priorities. Our performance in 2020 was a testament to Masco's culture of solving problems, serving customers and delivering better solutions. I want to thank all our 18,000 employees across the globe for their outstanding efforts throughout 2020. 
Now let me provide you with some brief comments on our fourth quarter before I turn to our full year results and conclude with our thoughts on 2021. Turning to Slide 4. Our top line increased 12%, excluding the impact of currency in the fourth quarter. We saw growth across our entire portfolio, led by strong growth in North American plumbing, international plumbing and our paint business. 
Operating profit increased 20%, and our operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter as we leveraged our strong volume growth. Our earnings per share for the quarter increased an outstanding 36%. 
Turning to our segments. Plumbing grew 12%, excluding currency, with 14% growth in North American plumbing and 8% growth in international plumbing. North American plumbing was led by Delta Faucet Company with 18% growth. Our spa business also achieved growth in the fourth quarter as we continued to effectively manage COVID-related restrictions. Hansgrohe drove strong growth in Germany and China, as those markets have recovered nicely from earlier in the year. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, Bayer continued its tremendous year with high teens DIY paint growth and mid-single-digit pro paint growth in the fourth quarter. Our Lighting and our Bath & Cabinet hardware businesses also contributed nicely to growth in the quarter. 
In regards to capital allocation, we resumed our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.3 million shares for $125 million during the quarter. And we executed 3 bolt-on acquisitions, which we expect to contribute approximately 3% top line growth in 2021. The largest was the acquisition of Kraus, an online plumbing fixture company focused on modern, high-quality sync faucets and related products. Kraus will operate as an affiliate of Delta Faucet Company. This leading digitally native brand will complement our online capabilities in the fast-growing e-commerce channel. 
Also in our Plumbing segment, Hansgrohe, in January, acquired a 75% interest in Easy Sanitary Solutions, or ESS, a Netherlands based developer and manufacturer of high style, linear drain solutions. ESS shares Hansgrohe's focus on innovation, design and responsibility and will further expand our strong presence in the shower space. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, we acquired Work Tools International, a leading manufacturer of high-quality precision paint tools and accessories, including brushes, rollers and mini rollers for both DIY and professional painters under the Wizz and Elder and Jing's brand names. These acquisitions are consistent with our M&A criteria in that they are leaders in their respective categories, have a strong fit with our existing strategy, increase our market share in complementary or adjacent product categories, and meet our bolt-on acquisition return criteria, which is to exceed our risk-adjusted cost of capital within a 3-year timeframe. 
Now let's review our full year performance. Please turn to Slide 5. For the full year, sales grew 7%, led by double-digit growth from Delta Faucet, Bayer Paint and Liberty Hardware. Delta gained share with double-digit growth across its retail, trade and e-commerce channels. Hansgrohe gained share in its 2 largest markets of Germany and China. 
In our Spa business, which was the most impacted by shutdown orders and limits on employees in its Mexican facilities, overcame significant obstacles to end the year down only mid-single digits and enters 2021 with a record backlog due to the tremendous demand for its products. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, we were well positioned with our leading brands, Bayer and KILZ, and our strong channel partners to capitalize on the powerful resurgence in DIY paint. This resulted in full year growth of over 20% in DIY paint. 
Propane demand was soft in Q2 and Q3, but returned to growth in the fourth quarter and is accelerating into 2021. While total company sales grew 7%, operating profit increased 18%, as we leveraged the strong volume growth and enacted significant cost reduction across the organization, including a hiring and wage freeze for part of the year, significantly lower brand and marketing spend, a freeze on certain growth investments for part of the year and obviously, drastically reduced travel and entertainment expense. These actions, coupled with our strong volume leverage, resulted in significant operating margin expansion of 170 basis points in 2020. 
Our strong cash generation allowed us to deploy nearly $1.1 billion in capital during the year. We repurchased $727 million of our stock at an average price of approximately $30 per share -- excuse me, $39 per share. We returned approximately $145 million in dividends to shareholders. We completed 4 bolt-on acquisitions for $227 million, and we finished the year with over $1.3 billion in cash on hand and net leverage of 1x. 
This strong operating profit growth, combined with our significant capital deployment, resulted in exceptional financial results. 37% earnings per share growth to $3.12 per share, exceeding our 2019 Investor Day guidance for 2021 a full year earlier than planned. Free cash flow of over $1 billion with a conversion rate of 118%, and a return on invested capital of approximately 42%. Now turning to '21. 
While precise forecasting is a significant challenge in this dynamic environment, I'd like to share with you our view of the markets where we compete. For the North American repair and remodel market, we expect market growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range, with strong growth in the first half, followed by difficult comps in the second half. 
For the paint market, a subset of the repair and remodel market for us, we expect the DIY paint market to be down low to mid-single digits and the propane market to grow mid-single digits. And for our International markets, principally Europe, we expect a low single-digit growth environment. 
While the U.S. market will face challenging comps in the back half of '21, leading indicators remain robust. Home price appreciation was up nearly 13% in December, and existing home sales were up over 22% compared to prior year. Each of these metrics has a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis. 
Based on these assumptions and our expectation that we will continue to gain share and outperform the market, we anticipate Masco's growth to be in the range of 5% to 9%, excluding currency for 2021, and 7% to 11%, including currency. This is based on expected organic growth of 2% to 6%, excluding currency, growth from our completed acquisitions of approximately 3% and growth from foreign currency translation of approximately 2%. We expect margins to be approximately 17%, and earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45 for 2021. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our Board announced its intention to increase our annual dividend to $0.94 per share, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, a 68% increase, as we have raised our targeted dividend payout ratio from 20% to 30% based on the strength of our business model and cash generation capabilities. 
In addition to announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend, our Board also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. Our strategy remains unchanged: to deploy our free cash flow after dividends to share repurchase or acquisitions. And based on our strong liquidity position of over $1.3 billion in cash at year-end and our projected free cash flow, we expect to deploy approximately $800 million to share repurchases or acquisitions in 2021. Now I'll turn the call over to John to go over our fourth quarter, full year and 2021 outlook in more detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance from continuing operations, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. Turning to Slide 7. 
We delivered a strong finish to a record year. Fourth quarter sales increased a robust 12%, excluding currency. In local currency, North American sales increased 13%. This outstanding performance was mainly driven by strong volume growth in North American faucets and showers as well as DIY paint. 
In local currency, international sales increased 8%. Gross margin was 35.6% in the quarter, up 100 basis points as we leverage increased volume, partially offset by higher rebates and program costs. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 19% in the quarter. This was primarily due to increases in certain variable costs such as incentive compensation, program costs, advertising and legal accruals. 
We delivered strong fourth quarter operating profit of $309 million, up $52 million or 20% from last year, with operating margins expanding 90 basis points to 16.6%. Our fourth quarter EPS increased 36% to $0.75. Please note that this performance is based on a normalized tax rate of 25% versus the previously guided 26% tax rate. Changes to IRS guidance in late 2020 and how certain foreign income is taxed in the U.S. lowered our normalized tax rate to 25%. As this change was retroactive, restated adjusted EPS numbers for 2019 and the first 3 quarters of 2020 can be found in the appendix on Slide 28. 
Turning to the full year 2020. Sales increased 7%, excluding currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted the full year by $13 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 9% and the international sales decreased 1%, as many European markets were slower to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. 
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 17.9% for the full year as a result of our rapid pandemic related cost containment. For the full year, operating profit increased $196 million or 18%, with operating margins expanding 170 basis points to 18.2%. 
Lastly, our EPS increased 37% to $3.12 for the full year. I want to thank our employees across the globe for their hard work, dedication and commitment to safety that enabled us to achieve record results in an extremely challenging year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing grew 12% in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency. North American sales increased 14% in local currency, led by Delta's 18% growth in the quarter. Delta continues to drive robust consumer demand across our wholesale, retail and e-commerce customers. 
As Keith mentioned, Watkins, our spa business, delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter as they continued to experience strong demand for their products. They have a record backlog despite operating at less than 100% capacity due to ongoing government-mandated employee limitations in our Mexican facilities. 
International plumbing sales in the fourth quarter increased 8% in local currency. Hansgrohe once again,led growth, driving double-digit growth in both Germany and China. Operating profit was $224 million in the quarter, up $44 million or 24%, with margins expanding 160 basis points to 19.1%. The strong performance was driven by incremental volume and cost containment initiatives, partially offset by higher year-end program costs, marketing and other increased variable expenses. 
Turning to the full year 2020. Sales increased 3%, excluding currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted full year sales by approximately $15 million. In local currency, North American plumbing sales grew 6% and international Plumbing sales grew -- decreased 1%. Full year operating profit was $813 million, up $92 million or 13%, with margins expanding an outstanding 160 basis points to 19.7%. 
Turning to 2021. We expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 14%, with 4% to 7% organic growth, another 4% growth from the recent acquisitions, and given current exchange rates, foreign currency that favorably benefit plumbing revenue by approximately 3% or $112 million. We anticipate full year margins will be approximately 18%, given that in 2020, we delayed approximately $40 million in costs and investments due to COVID. We expect a significant portion of this to return in 2021 in the form of investments in our brands, service and innovation to fuel future growth. 
We will also have increased amortization expense of approximately $11 million due to purchase accounting. Segment operating margins will decline by approximately 60 basis points due to this incremental amortization in the 2 recent acquisitions. 
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural grew 12% in the fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in our paint business. Our DIY paid business continued its strong year as high-teens growth in our propane business rebounded nicely in the quarter with mid- single-digit growth. Our Builders Hardware and Lighting business also benefited from increased consumer demand, and each contributed to the segment's results by delivering solid growth. 
Operating profit in the quarter increased 9%, driven by incremental volume, partially offset by an unfavorable price cost relationship as well as higher variable compensation and legal accruals of approximately $10 million. 
Turning to full year 2020. Sales increased 12%, driven by the resurgence in DIY paint in the year. While Pro business declined slightly over the prior year, we saw a solid improvement in demand in the fourth quarter. Full year operating income increased $98 million or 20%, with operating margins expanding 120 basis points to 19.2%. 
In 2021, we expect Decorative Architectural segment sales to grow in the range of 2% to 7%, with a 0% to 5% organic growth, another 1.5% from the acquisition. We also expect segment operating margins of approximately 19%. 
Looking specifically at paint growth for 2021, we currently anticipate our DIY business to be approximately flat with 2020 and  our Pro business to increase high single digits. In addition, the acquisition completed at the end of 2020 will add approximately $3 million of incremental amortization expense due to purchase accounting. 
And turning to Slide 10. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1x, and we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percentage of sales finished the year at 15.2%, excluding acquisitions, an improvement of 50 basis points over prior year. This performance was excellent. 
As we enter 2021, our inventory levels will require some reinvestment to sustain our outstanding delivery performance. With our strong operating and working capital performance and lower the normal CapEx, adjusted free cash flow was extremely strong at $1 billion, representing 118% of adjusted net income from continuing operations. 
During 2020, we repurchased 18.8 million outstanding shares for approximately $727 million, and we increased our annual dividend by 4% to $0.56 per share. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that Moody's recently upgraded our credit rating to BAA2 based on our improved credit metrics and strong financial performance. 
We have summarized our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We expect overall sales growth of 7% to 11%, with operating margins in the range of approximately 17%. We currently expect that growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year as we will obviously face our impressive 2020 comps in the second half of 2021. One thing to keep in mind is that in 2021, we expect to annuitize and terminate certain of our U.S. defined benefit plans in either the second or third quarter. As a result, we will incur a noncash settlement charge of approximately $450 million when we terminate the plans. We will adjust out this charge for purposes of our adjusted EPS calculation. 
Additionally, we will make a final one-time cash pension contribution of approximately $140 million to settle these plans. This amount will reduce our cash from operations similar to the approximate $50 million of defined benefit contributions made to these plans in the past several years. This also means that beginning in 2022, cash from operations will increase by approximately $15 million as compared to prior years, improving our already strong free cash flow conversion. 
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2021 EPS estimate of $3.25 to $3.45 represents 7% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 255 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 17 in our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

While there is clearly much focus on these short-term dynamics, let me share with you how we are thinking about Masco for the long term. Please turn to Slide 12. 
The repair and remodel industry is attractive with favorable fundamentals. Growth on average is approximately GDP plus 1% to 2% and is less cyclical than the new home construction market. Favorable demographics will help drive repair and remodel demand, and we are on the leading edge of the large millennial cohort forming households. 
Older homes require more repair and remodel spending, and the average age of housing has increased due to significant underbuilding of homes since the downturn of 2008. And the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly increased the desire for more enjoyable living space, which has led to increased home demand and remodeling expenditures. 
Masco is a low ticket repair and remodel focused business with market-leading brands with product and geographic diversification, which provides growth and stability through an economic cycle. We leverage our customer insights, broad channel relationships, scale, diversification, and our Masco operating system to drive innovation and make our businesses better. 
With our market-leading brands, history of innovation, strong management teams and focus on serving our customers in this attractive industry, combined with our strong free cash flow and capital deployment, our long-term expectation is to grow earnings per share on average by approximately 10% each year. This is comprised of above-market organic growth in the range of 3% to 5% annually, growth from acquisitions in the range of 1% to 3%, margin expansion each year through cost productivity and volume leverage, and continued capital deployment in the form of share buybacks, which should contribute approximately 2% to 4% EPS growth; and dividends, which should add approximately 1% to 2% return on top of the EPS growth. 
While 2020 was an extremely challenging year, we responded exceptionally well and are poised to continue to drive shareholder value creation in the future. 
Now with that, we'll turn the call over to Q&A."

What else could impact it to bridge the difference? There might be -- there's probably a little bit of headwind from commodity inflation because, as you know, we don't always perfectly match the timing of any pricing or any other actions we may take to offset commodity inflation with actually feeling the inflation through our P&L. So that's probably, but I'd say that's a pretty small impact overall."

We have our Masco operating system that has proven itself in terms of productivity and total cost productivity across our business units. We obviously expect continued good, solid drop down on incremental volume. So yes, our expectation would be that we would continue to expand margins. 
I think one point I would like to make, Matthew, is if you look at our margin and you factor out, let's say, from -- obviously, 2020 was a very unique year. But if you look at how we performed '19 and our estimated guide in 2021, and you factor out some of that investment accounting for acquisition -- or excuse me, purchase accounting that John talked about, when you look at, say, the middle of our of our guide, the drop-down that we're anticipating on this incremental volume is right in there in that 25%, 30% range that we've talked about. 
So clearly, 2020 was a unique kind of perfect storm for margin, if you will, where we had good leverage on our incremental volume. We cut way back on some costs that we -- as I've talked about before, we know that those cutbacks weren't going to continue and that we need to continue to invest in areas like channel penetration, e-commerce, long-term connected home and those sorts of things. And we're going to continue to do that, and we're going to continue to invest in our brands because it works.

And then second, specifically with respect to your thoughts around the Decorative Architectural segment, recall that our Kichler business we have indicated that, that business we're turning around and a lot of the good work that the team has done over the course of the last year, 1.5 years there, will start to bear fruit in 2021. And supplementing that good work will also be some reduced amortization from the acquisition of that in the range of $7 million or $8 million on an annual basis.

So I'll start off maybe a little bit, and then Keith can supplement my remarks. So first comment, maybe we'll take a step back, Phil, and talk more broadly about the commodity basket that we're facing, and then talk about them in the shape of the plumbing margins. 
So if you take a look at the various raw materials that impact our financial statements, obviously, copper and zinc have started to inflate really in the back half of the year, but really have been pretty strong since the middle of the fourth quarter, kind of the November timeframe, really started to see copper and zinc inflate. 
And at the same time, if you think about the input costs or the input basket that goes into paint, which are really twofold, one is titanium dioxide and the other are the more of the petroleum linked engineered resins, we have started to see inflation in both, probably more so on the engineered resin side than in TiO2. But TiO2 recently is starting to inflate. And as a matter of fact, as I think about the inflation as it hits the raws and paint, engineered resins have probably even accelerated more in the last several weeks. 
And so the way we're going to approach this is the way we've historically approached our raw materials. One, obviously, we think, in total, Phil, that, that raw material inflation will be kind of a low single digits range on us during the course of the year. But we'll go after it in the way we typically do. And that is, we negotiate with our suppliers. We work out our internal cost productivity. And then we also, to the extent that's required, we'll take pricing actions. 
And as I think you'll recall, we tend to be price cost-neutral over time. That said, we can't always perfectly time these things. So you might see a quarter or so of margin contraction because of  us feeling the pricing impact or the cost impact of the raw material inflation before we're able to implement price, but that should level out over time. So Keith, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add?"

If you think about it, let's say, mid single-digit type inflation in our paint basket and probably lower than that. In our Plumbing Basket logistics, we're seeing some pressure there. But logistics is a low single-digit cost for us, so that's not such a big impact. 
And this is nothing that's new to us. I've been in the seat now going on 7 years, and we've seen this several different cycles of this kind of thing. And we go at it with productivity improvements through our Masco operating system. We go at it with supplier negotiations. And because of our consistent investment innovation in brands, we're able to, when we need to, go after it with price. 
So over time, as we've talked about, we're neutral as it relates to price cost. And there are some leads and lags in that, and that can go both ways. But fundamentally, we don't view that as changing at all. We don't expect it to change going into '21."

We're seeing it mainly in the interior side, and we would expect that from a seasonality perspective.  But I think that's, Susan, fundamentally the driver."

So we did see favorable mix across many of our businesses in 2020. But it was a relatively modest impact overall. 
We saw favorable mix, obviously, in some of our plumbing fixtures. We saw some of it in our spa business, as we saw some of our higher-end spa sale. And to your point, we saw it in paint with a little bit better mix of DI -- more DIY and a little bit less Pro. As we think about that as we go into 2021, again, I don't think mix is going to have a significant impact. Could there be a modest headwind from mix in our paint business? Yes, but it'd be relatively modest. 
And I would say that the negative mix that we've been experiencing in plumbing in Europe will probably likely continue into 2021. That's been something we've been experiencing probably for about 24 months now, and we don't see that changing too much. 
But again, overall, I want to make sure you take away that it's not going to be an overall significant impact to the business."

So yes, good -- leading the growth story in plumbing would be Watkins for sure. You're right. In terms of international and that low single-digit guide, that's primarily our European business. And that's a mixed bag, as you might expect. We're continuing to see strong growth in our home markets of Central Europe and China. And we continue to be challenged, as you might expect, as is everybody in England and Italy and some other locations. So it's a mixed bag, but you're right on in terms of the low single digits. 
When we look across North American plumbing, we'll expect to see really solid continued share gains across all of our channels, but a higher growth rate in e-commerce. And I think our acquisition of Kraus, the leading digitally native brand in the space feeds right into that and gives us a lot of flexibility and capabilities to continue to outgrow that. 
On the retail front, we have been the leader in share of shelf in the faucet aisle for many, many years, and that's continuing, and we're continuing to invest to keep that lead. So we expect good growth there. And obviously, between our BrassCraft and Delta, very solid brands in the plumbing wholesale trade. So we continue -- we expect to continue to outgrow the market there. 
So you've hit it on the head with regards to how we're thinking about international. Watkins leading the way. Obviously, e-commerce as a channel will grow faster than others, and we're going to continue to gain share across the board."

First and foremost, it's the team, the deal team. John is leading it and the people that he has on his team are outstanding. And they've demonstrated it by what they were able to do in 2020. As you know, even though these were smallish acquisitions, the workload and the work on cultivating these isn't any less than a big acquisition, and they were able to do it exceedingly well. So I'm confident in the team. 
Secondly, it's the actual pipeline and our MOS process of cultivation and looking at what's available. So it's still a challenge as valuations really haven't soften that much, and that informs the need to stay close to the core, and that's our strategy. 
As I said before, we will look at bigger ones. But fundamentally, we're looking at tuck-ins where we can bring synergies to make our return work.

I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. 2020 was a challenging year for all of us. As the virus started reshaping our lives, our economy and our business, we established 3 priorities to guide us throughout the year: Number one, keep our employees safe; two, meet the needs of our customers; and three, position Masco to outperform the recovery.
Our employees across our business units did a tremendous job to deliver on all of these priorities. Our performance in 2020 was a testament to Masco's culture of solving problems, serving customers and delivering better solutions. I want to thank all our 18,000 employees across the globe for their outstanding efforts throughout 2020.
Now let me provide you with some brief comments on our fourth quarter before I turn to our full year results and conclude with our thoughts on 2021. Turning to Slide 4. Our top line increased 12%, excluding the impact of currency in the fourth quarter. We saw growth across our entire portfolio, led by strong growth in North American plumbing, international plumbing and our paint business. 
Operating profit increased 20%, and our operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter as we leveraged our strong volume growth. Our earnings per share for the quarter increased an outstanding 36%. 
Turning to our segments. Plumbing grew 12%, excluding currency, with 14% growth in North American plumbing and 8% growth in international plumbing. North American plumbing was led by Delta Faucet Company with 18% growth. Our spa business also achieved growth in the fourth quarter as we continued to effectively manage COVID-related restrictions. Hansgrohe drove strong growth in Germany and China, as those markets have recovered nicely from earlier in the year.
In our Decorative Architectural segment, Behr continued its tremendous year with high teens DIY paint growth and mid-single-digit pro paint growth in the fourth quarter. Our Lighting and our Bath & Cabinet hardware businesses also contributed nicely to growth in the quarter.
In regards to capital allocation, we resumed our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.3 million shares for $125 million during the quarter. And we executed 3 bolt-on acquisitions, which we expect to contribute approximately 3% top line growth in 2021. The largest was the acquisition of Kraus, an online plumbing fixture company focused on modern, high-quality sinks faucets and related products. Kraus will operate as an affiliate of Delta Faucet Company. This leading digitally native brand will complement our online capabilities in the fast-growing e-commerce channel. 
Also in our Plumbing segment, Hansgrohe, in January, acquired a 75% interest in Easy Sanitary Solutions, or ESS, a Netherlands based developer and manufacturer of high style, linear drain solutions. ESS shares Hansgrohe's focus on innovation, design and responsibility and will further expand our strong presence in the shower space.
In our Decorative Architectural segment, we acquired Work Tools International, a leading manufacturer of high-quality precision paint tools and accessories, including brushes, rollers and mini-rollers for both DIY and professional painters under the WHIZZ and Elder & Jenks brand names. These acquisitions are consistent with our M&A criteria, in that they are leaders in their respective categories, have a strong fit with our existing strategy, increase our market share in complementary or adjacent product categories, and meet our bolt-on acquisition return criteria, which is to exceed our risk-adjusted cost of capital within a 3-year time frame.
Now let's review our full year performance. Please turn to Slide 5. For the full year, sales grew 7%, led by double-digit growth from Delta Faucet, Behr Paint and Liberty Hardware. Delta gained share with double-digit growth across its retail, trade and e-commerce channels. Hansgrohe gained share in its 2 largest markets of Germany and China.
In our Spa business, which was the most impacted by shutdown orders and limits on employees in its Mexican facilities, overcame significant obstacles to end the year down only mid-single digits and entered 2021 with a record backlog due to the tremendous demand for its products.
In our Decorative Architectural segment, we were well positioned with our leading brands, Behr and KILZ, and our strong channel partners to capitalize on the powerful resurgence in DIY paint. This resulted in full year growth of over 20% in DIY paint. Pro paint demand was soft in Q2 and Q3, but returned to growth in the fourth quarter and is accelerating into 2021.
While total company sales grew 7%, operating profit increased 18%, as we leveraged the strong volume growth and enacted significant cost reduction across the organization, including a hiring and wage freeze for part of the year, significantly lower brand and marketing spend, a freeze on certain growth investments for part of the year and, obviously, drastically reduced travel and entertainment expense. These actions, coupled with our strong volume leverage, resulted in significant operating margin expansion of 170 basis points in 2020.
Our strong cash generation allowed us to deploy nearly $1.1 billion in capital during the year. We repurchased $727 million of our stock at an average price of approximately $30 per share -- excuse me, $39 per share. We returned approximately $145 million in dividends to shareholders. We completed 4 bolt-on acquisitions for $227 million, and we finished the year with over $1.3 billion in cash on hand and net leverage of 1x.
This strong operating profit growth, combined with our significant capital deployment, resulted in exceptional financial results. 37% earnings per share growth to $3.12 per share, exceeding our 2019 Investor Day guidance for 2021 a full year earlier than planned. Free cash flow of over $1 billion with a conversion rate of 118%, and a return on invested capital of approximately 42%.
Now turning to '21. While precise forecasting is a significant challenge in this dynamic environment, I'd like to share with you our view of the markets where we compete. For the North American repair and remodel market, we expect the market growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range, with strong growth in the first half, followed by difficult comps in the second half.
For the paint market, a subset of the repair and remodel market for us, we expect the DIY paint market to be down low to mid-single digits and the pro paint market to grow mid-single digits. And for our International markets, principally Europe, we expect a low single-digit growth environment.
While the U.S. market will face challenging comps in the back half of '21, leading indicators remain robust. Home price appreciation was up nearly 13% in December, and existing home sales were up over 22% compared to prior year. Each of these metrics has a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis. 
Based on these assumptions and our expectation that we will continue to gain share and outperform the market, we anticipate Masco's growth to be in the range of 5% to 9%, excluding currency for 2021, and 7% to 11%, including currency. This is based on expected organic growth of 2% to 6%, excluding currency, growth from our completed acquisitions of approximately 3% and growth from foreign currency translation of approximately 2%. We expect margins to be approximately 17%, and earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45 for 2021.
Turning to capital allocation. Our Board announced its intention to increase our annual dividend to $0.94 per share, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, a 68% increase, as we have raised our targeted dividend payout ratio from 20% to 30% based on the strength of our business model and cash generation capabilities.
In addition to announcing its intention to increase our annual dividend, our Board also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. Our strategy remains unchanged: to deploy our free cash flow after dividends to share repurchase or acquisitions. And based on our strong liquidity position of over $1.3 billion in cash at year-end and our projected free cash flow, we expect to deploy approximately $800 million to share repurchases or acquisitions in 2021.
Now I'll turn the call over to John to go over our fourth quarter, full year and 2021 outlook in more detail. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance from continuing operations, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. Turning to Slide 7. We delivered a strong finish to a record year. Fourth quarter sales increased a robust 12%, excluding currency. In local currency, North American sales increased 13%. This outstanding performance was mainly driven by strong volume growth in North American faucets and showers as well as DIY paint.
In local currency, international sales increased 8%. Gross margin was 35.6% in the quarter, up 100 basis points as we leverage increased volume, partially offset by higher rebates and program costs. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 19% in the quarter. This was primarily due to increases in certain variable costs, such as incentive compensation, program costs, advertising and legal accruals.
We delivered strong fourth quarter operating profit of $309 million, up $52 million or 20% from last year, with operating margins expanding 90 basis points to 16.6%. Our fourth quarter EPS increased 36% to $0.75. Please note that this performance is based on a normalized tax rate of 25% versus the previously guided 26% tax rate. Changes to IRS guidance in late 2020 and how certain foreign income is taxed in the U.S. lowered our normalized tax rate to 25%. As this change was retroactive, restated adjusted EPS numbers for 2019 and the first 3 quarters of 2020 can be found in the appendix on Slide 28.
Turning to the full year 2020. Sales increased 7%, excluding currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted the full year by $13 million. In local currency, North American sales increased 9% and the international sales decreased 1%, as many European markets were slower to recover from the impact of COVID-19.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 17.9% for the full year as a result of our rapid pandemic-related cost containment. For the full year, operating profit increased $196 million or 18%, with operating margins expanding 170 basis points to 18.2%. Lastly, our EPS increased 37% to $3.12 for the full year. I want to thank our employees across the globe for their hard work, dedication and commitment to safety that enabled us to achieve record results in an extremely challenging year.
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing grew 12% in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency. North American sales increased 14% in local currency, led by Delta's 18% growth in the quarter. Delta continues to drive robust consumer demand across our wholesale, retail and e-commerce customers.
As Keith mentioned, Watkins, our spa business, delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter as they continued to experience strong demand for their products. They have a record backlog despite operating at less than 100% capacity due to ongoing government-mandated employee limitations in our Mexican facilities. International plumbing sales in the fourth quarter increased 8% in local currency. Hansgrohe once again led growth, driving double-digit growth in both Germany and China.
Operating profit was $224 million in the quarter, up $44 million or 24%, with margins expanding 160 basis points to 19.1%. The strong performance was driven by incremental volume and cost containment initiatives, partially offset by higher year-end program costs, marketing and other increased variable expenses.
Turning to the full year 2020. Sales increased 3%, excluding currency. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted full year sales by approximately $15 million. In local currency, North American plumbing grew -- sales grew 6% and international Plumbing sales grew -- decreased 1%. Full year operating profit was $813 million, up $92 million or 13%, with margins expanding an outstanding 160 basis points to 19.7%.
Turning to 2021. We expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 14%, with 4% to 7% organic growth, another 4% growth from the recent acquisitions, and given current exchange rates, foreign currency to favorably benefit plumbing revenue by approximately 3% or $112 million. We anticipate full year margins will be approximately 18%, given that in 2020, we delayed approximately $40 million in costs and investments due to COVID. We expect a significant portion of this to return in 2021 in the form of investments in our brands, service and innovation to fuel future growth. We will also have increased amortization expense of approximately $11 million due to purchase accounting. Segment operating margins will decline by approximately 60 basis points due to this incremental amortization and the 2 recent acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural grew 12% in the fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in our paint business. Our DIY paint business continued its strong year with high-teens growth and our pro paint business rebounded nicely in the quarter with mid-single-digit growth. Our builders' hardware and lighting business also benefited from increased consumer demand, and each contributed to the segment's results by delivering solid growth.
Operating profit in the quarter increased 9%, driven by incremental volume, partially offset by an unfavorable price cost relationship as well as higher variable compensation and legal accruals of approximately $10 million.
Turning to full year 2020. Sales increased 12%, driven by the resurgence in DIY paint in the year. While pro business declined slightly over the prior year, we saw a solid improvement in demand in the fourth quarter. Full year operating income increased $98 million or 20%, with operating margins expanding 120 basis points to 19.2%.
In 2021, we expect Decorative Architectural segment sales to grow in the range of 2% to 7%, with 0% to 5% organic growth and another 1.5% from the acquisition. We also expect segment operating margins of approximately 19%.
Looking specifically at paint growth for 2021, we currently anticipate our DIY business to be approximately flat with 2020 and our PRO business to increase high single digits. In addition, the acquisition completed at the end of 2020 will add approximately $3 million of incremental amortization expense due to purchase accounting.
And turning to Slide 10. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1x, and we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percentage of sales finished the year at 15.2%, excluding acquisitions, an improvement of 50 basis points over prior year. This performance was excellent.
As we enter 2021, our inventory levels will require some reinvestment to sustain our outstanding delivery performance. With our strong operating and working capital performance and lower-the-normal CapEx, adjusted free cash flow was extremely strong at $1 billion, representing 118% of adjusted net income from continuing operations.
During 2020, we repurchased 18.8 million outstanding shares for approximately $727 million, and we increased our annual dividend by 4% to $0.56 per share.
Finally, I'm pleased to report that Moody's recently upgraded our credit rating to BAA2 based on our improved credit metrics and strong financial performance. 
We have summarized our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We expect overall sales growth of 7% to 11%, with operating margins in the range of approximately 17%. We currently expect that growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year as we will obviously face our impressive 2020 comps in the second half of 2021. One thing to keep in mind is that in 2021, we expect to annuitize and terminate certain of our U.S. defined benefit plans in either the second or third quarter. As a result, we will incur a noncash settlement charge of approximately $450 million when we terminate the plans. We will adjust out this charge for purposes of our adjusted EPS calculation.
Additionally, we will make a final one-time cash pension contribution of approximately $140 million to settle these plans. This amount will reduce our cash from operations similar to the approximate $50 million of defined benefit contributions made to these plans in the past several years. This also means that beginning in 2022, cash from operations will increase by approximately $15 million as compared to prior years, improving our already strong free cash flow conversion.
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2021 EPS estimate of $3.25 to $3.45 represents 7% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 255 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 17 in our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

While there is clearly much focus on these short-term dynamics, let me share with you how we are thinking about Masco for the long term.
Please turn to Slide 12. The repair and remodel industry is attractive with favorable fundamentals. Growth on average is approximately GDP plus 1% to 2% and is less cyclical than the new home construction market. Favorable demographics will help drive repair and remodel demand, and we are on the leading edge of the large millennial cohort forming households.
Older homes require more repair and remodel spending, and the average age of housing has increased due to significant underbuilding of homes since the downturn of 2008. And the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly increased the desire for more enjoyable living space, which has led to increased home demand and remodeling expenditures.
Masco is a low ticket repair and remodel focused business with market-leading brands with product and geographic diversification, which provides growth and stability through an economic cycle. We leverage our customer insights, broad channel relationships, scale, diversification, and our Masco operating system to drive innovation and make our businesses better.
With our market-leading brands, history of innovation, strong management teams and focus on serving our customers in this attractive industry, combined with our strong free cash flow and capital deployment, our long-term expectation is to grow earnings per share on average by approximately 10% each year. This is comprised of above-market organic growth in the range of 3% to 5% annually, growth from acquisitions in the range of 1% to 3%, margin expansion each year through cost productivity and volume leverage, and continued capital deployment in the form of share buybacks, which should contribute approximately 2% to 4% EPS growth, and dividends, which should add approximately 1% to 2% return on top of the EPS growth.
While 2020 was an extremely challenging year, we responded exceptionally well and are poised to continue to drive shareholder value creation in the future.
Now with that, we'll turn the call over to Q&A."

What else could impact it to bridge the difference? There might be -- there's probably a little bit of headwind from commodity inflation because, as you know, we don't always perfectly match the timing of any pricing or any other actions we may take to offset commodity inflation with actually feeling the inflation through our P&L. So that's probably, but I'd say that's a pretty small impact overall."

I think one point I would like to make, Matthew, is if you look at our margin and you factor out, let's say, from -- obviously, 2020 was a very unique year. But if you look at how we performed '19 and our estimated guide in 2021, and you factor out some of that investment accounting for acquisition -- or excuse me, purchase accounting that John talked about, when you look at, say, the middle of our of our guide, the drop down that we're anticipating on this incremental volume is right in there in that 25%, 30% range that we've talked about.
So clearly, 2020 was a unique kind of perfect storm for margin, if you will, where we had good leverage on our incremental volume. We cut way back on some costs that we -- as I've talked about before, we know that those cutbacks weren't going to continue and that we need to continue to invest in areas like channel penetration, e-commerce, long-term connected home and those sorts of things. And we're going to continue to do that, and we're going to continue to invest in our brands because it works. But yes, you're exactly right, we expect continued margin expansion."

And then second, specifically with respect to your thoughts around the Decorative Architectural segment, recall that our Kichler business, we have indicated that, that business we're turning around and a lot of the good work that the team has done over the course of the last year, 1.5 years there will start to bear fruit in 2021.
And supplementing that good work will also be some reduced amortization from the acquisition of that in the range of $7 million or $8 million on an annual basis. So I think that also helps explain a little bit of the higher margins in Decorative Architectural."

And at the same time, if you think about the input costs or the input basket that goes into paint, which are really twofold, one is titanium dioxide and the other are the more of the petroleum-linked engineered resins. We have started to see inflation in both, probably more so on the engineered resin side than in TiO2. But TiO2 recently is starting to inflate. And as a matter of fact, as I think about the inflation, as it hits the raws and paint, engineered resins have probably even accelerated more in the last several weeks.
And so the way we're going to approach this is the way we've historically approached our raw materials. One, obviously, we think, in total, Phil, that, that raw material inflation will be kind of a low single digits range on us during the course of the year. But we'll go after it in the way we typically do. And that is, we negotiate with our suppliers. We work out our internal cost productivity. And then we also, to the extent that's required, will take pricing actions.
And as I think you'll recall, we tend to be price cost-neutral over time. That said, we can't always perfectly time these things. So you might see a quarter or so of margin contraction because of us feeling the pricing impact or the cost impact of the raw material inflation before we're able to implement price, but that should level out over time. So Keith, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add?"

We are experiencing some commodity pressures and some cost pressures. If you think about it, let's say, mid-single-digit type inflation in our paint basket and probably lower than that in our plumbing basket. Logistics, we're seeing some pressure there. But logistics is a low single-digit cost for us, so that's not such a big impact.
And this is nothing that's new to us. I've been in the seat now going on 7 years, and we've seen this -- several different cycles of this kind of thing. And we go at it with productivity improvements through our Masco operating system. We go at it with supplier negotiations. And because of our consistent investment in innovation and brands, we're able to, when we need to, go after it with price.
So over time, as we've talked about, we're neutral as it relates to price cost. And there are some leads and lags in that, and that can go both ways. But fundamentally though, we don't view that as changing at all. We don't expect it to change going into '21."

And then, obviously, we face much more significant margins in the second half of the year.
And so that will -- as a comp in the back half of 2020, I think our margins in Q3 last year were 23%, 24%. And so those tough margins will be tough to comp against. And so probably not as good of margins in the back half of the year."

Now it sounds like you're saying something a little different that you're expecting some amount of margin improvement going forward. And John, I appreciate your comments saying maybe in the tens of basis points, not the hundreds, and -- but talking about an incremental margin being above the margin that you're currently generating. So I just wanted to understand maybe what changed between then and now?
It was my understanding that the outlook given at the last Analyst Day was more driven by the fact that you certainly have kind of a level of reinvestment in the business and investment for growth, investment in your channel partners, and that was what was more keeping it at the range that it was. So just trying to get a better sense of what's different in the margin outlook today versus back then?"

I'll kick this one-off and then Keith might add some other color to this one. But I think the principal difference between what you heard from us at our 2019 Investor Day and what we're talking about now in terms of both growth and margin profile has to do with our underlying assumptions for the market.
We, in 2019, outlined fairly muted market growth going forward through the period of '21, which is really what we outlined. And obviously, things have played out much different than that. And even if you consider what we're laying out for 2021 today, it's better growth than we would have forecasted back in the fall of 2019.
And so I think that's the principal difference. Have -- our business is doing everything else that we would expect to do. Yes, are they driving innovation? Absolutely. Are they pushing for share gains? Yes. Are they doing all the right things in terms of their service and delivery capability? Yes. So all those good things are happening.

We had a different perspective on top line growth as the main driver when you compare the difference between our Investor Day in '19 and where we sit today, but it's also a combination of continuing our total cost productivity and leveraging our Masco operating system.
So long term, a little bit different outlook '19 versus where we sit today. We're committed to organic growth in that 3% to 5% range. I think we can add another 1% to 3% in acquisitions; buyback, in that 2% to 4% range, and that's how we see that long-term 10% growth in EPS.

You're right. In terms of international and that low single-digit guide, that's primarily our European business. And that's a mixed bag, as you might expect.

And we continue to be challenged, as you might expect, as is everybody, in England and Italy and some other locations. So it's a mixed bag, but you're right on in terms of the low single digits.
When we look across North American plumbing, we'll expect to see really solid continued share gains across all of our channels, but a higher growth rate in e-commerce. And I think our acquisition of Kraus, the leading digitally native brand in the space, feeds right into that and gives us a lot of flexibility and capabilities to continue to outgrow that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. While we are well over a year into this pandemic, the effects are still being felt.

While we are well over a year into this pandemic, the effects are still being felt. We are encouraged by the rollout of vaccines, but many areas around the globe continue to experience a surge in cases. The safety of our employees remains our #1 priority. And I would like to thank all our employees for keeping each other safe and for serving our customers. Through the efforts of our employees and the robust demand we continue to experience for our products, we delivered another outstanding quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 5. We had a strong start to 2021, and our ability to effectively navigate this highly-dynamic environment, resulted in exceptional top and bottom line growth. For the quarter, sales increased 25%. Excluding acquisitions and currency, sales increased 19%. Operating profit increased 61% to $366 million, principally due to strong volume leverage and reduced spending in the form of lower travel, entertainment and marketing expenses across our segments. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 89%. 
Turning to our Plumbing segment. Sales grew 27%, excluding currency, driven by strong volume growth at Hansgrohe, Delta and Watkins. Our 2 recent plumbing acquisitions performed well in the quarter and contributed 5% to Plumbing's growth. North American plumbing grew 28%, led by our Wellness business, which continued to experience strong demand and begin to comp the March shutdown of 2020. 
Delta Faucet delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, with strength across all channels, particularly e-commerce, which showed exceptional strength as consumers continue to shift their buying patterns to online. 
International Plumbing grew 37% in the quarter as many of our markets returned to strong growth, with particular strength in Central Europe and China. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 15% against a healthy 9% comp from Q1 of 2020. Acquisitions contributed 2% to our Decorative growth. Our Lighting, Bath & Cabinet hardware and Paint businesses each posted double-digit growth during the quarter. DIY paint grew high teens in the quarter, which is impressive, considering it was facing a strong double-digit comp in Q1 of '20. While Pro paint was down low single digits for the quarter, as it faced a tough comp in Q1 of 2020, we did see a return to positive growth in the back half of the quarter, and we're encouraged by the momentum we are now seeing in this business as we move into Q2. 
Lastly, we actively continued our share repurchases during the quarter by repurchasing 5.5 million shares for $303 million. We anticipate deploying approximately $800 million towards share repurchases or acquisitions for the full year as we guided on our fourth quarter call. In addition, we anticipate receiving approximately $160 million for our preferred stock in cabinet works, from their recently announced transaction, assuming it closes as expected. We intend to deploy these funds towards share repurchases or acquisitions, which would be in addition to the $800 million that I just mentioned. 
Now let me discuss 2 issues that are top of mind right now, inflation and supply chain tightness. We have seen significant inflating raw materials, namely copper, zinc and resin used in both our paint and plumbing businesses as well as increases in freight costs. All in, we expect our raw material and freight cost to be up in the mid single-digit range for the full year for both our Plumbing and Decorative segments, with inflation likely reaching high-single-digit levels in both segments in the third and fourth quarters. To mitigate these impacts, we have secured price increases across both segments to begin offsetting these costs. We have further actions planned, including additional price increases, and productivity improvements, while continuing to work with our customers and suppliers to offset these rising costs. 
Time and again, we have demonstrated that our strong brands, innovation pipelines and channel relationships gives us the ability to offset rising costs. We expect to continue this track record and achieve price cost neutrality by year-end. And we are maintaining our full year margin expectations in both segments that we provided on our fourth quarter call. 
With respect to supply chain tightness, in addition to the strain caused by robust demand, we have been impacted by significant disruption in the supply of resins and related products in both our Plumbing and Paint businesses due to the severe weather that Texas experienced in February. Additionally, ocean container availability and timeliness continues to be constrained. This has temporarily reduced output of certain spot products during the month of April, and limited our ability to build certain -- to build inventory of certain architectural coatings and other products. However, the availability of resins is improving. And our teams have done an outstanding job utilizing Masco's size, scale and agility to countermeasure these issues by working with our key suppliers to increase availability of certain materials, by leveraging our purchasing power to increase container availability for our products and by working around the clock to adjust production to meet the needs of our customers. This once again shows the competitive advantage that comes from being part of Masco's portfolio. 
With our strong first quarter performance, the actions we have taken and will take to offset persistent inflation, the interest savings from our recent bond transaction and the continued strong demand for our products in innovative -- and products and brands, excuse me, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. This is up from our previous expectations of $3.25 to $3.45. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to John for additional detail on our first quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered a very strong start to the year as first quarter sales increased 25%. Currency increased sales by 2% in the quarter, and the 3 recently completed acquisitions contributed an additional 4% to growth. In local currency, North American sales increased 21% or 17% excluding acquisitions. This outstanding performance was driven by strong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas as well as DIY paint. 
In local currency, international sales increased 27% or 23% excluding acquisitions. Gross margin was 35.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points as we leveraged the increased volume. 
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 340 basis points to 17% in the quarter. This was primarily due to operating leverage, decreases in certain costs such as travel and entertainment and trade shows, and the deferral of certain marketing and other spend. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase throughout the year to a more normalized 18% as certain costs come back, along with additional investments in our brands, service and innovation to fuel future growth. 
We delivered an outstanding first quarter operating profit of $366 million, up $138 million or 61% from last year, with operating margins expanding 420 basis points to 18.6%. Our EPS was $0.89 in the quarter, an increase of 89% compared to the first quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing grew 31% in the quarter. Currency contributed 4% to this growth and acquisitions contributed another 5%. North American sales increased 27% in local currency or 22% excluding acquisitions. This was led by Delta's double-digit growth in the quarter as they continue to drive strong consumer demand across all their product categories and channels. 
Watkins, our wellness business was also a significant contributor to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong. Watkins' performance also benefited from a softer comp in the first quarter of last year, as government-mandated COVID lockdowns resulted in 2 of their manufacturing plants being temporarily shut in 2020. 
International Plumbing sales increased 27% in local currency or 23% excluding acquisitions. Hansgrohe delivered year-over-year increases across most of their markets with continued double-digit growth in both Germany and China. Demand remains strong in Central Europe to continued COVID restrictions, and we are starting to see improvement in the U.K. 
Operating profit was $253 million in the quarter, up $94 million or 59%, with operating margins expanding 370 basis points to 20.3%. This strong performance was driven by incremental volume, cost productivity initiatives and lower spend on items such as travel and entertainment, trade shows and marketing. This favorability was partially offset by an unfavorable price cost relationship. We expect raw material inflation in this segment to peak in the third quarter. 
During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest our Hajoca business, a small shower and closure business based in Germany as we determined it did not align with our strategic direction. Hajoca sales were approximately EUR 70 million in 2020. Net proceeds will not be material. 
Given our first quarter results and the current demand trends, we now expect Plumbing segment sales growth for 2021 to be in the 15% to 18% range with 10% to 13% organic growth, another 3% net growth from the recent acquisitions and then the divestiture of Hajoca. And given current exchange rates, we anticipate foreign currency to favorably benefit plumbing revenue by approximately 2% or $70 million. We continue to anticipate full year margins will be approximately 18%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural grew 15% for the first quarter or 13% excluding acquisitions. This exceptional performance was driven by low teens growth in our Paint business. Our DIY paint is grew high teens against a strong double-digit comp in the first quarter of 2020. Our Pro business also faced a strong comp and declined low single digits in the quarter. Despite this decline in our Pro paint business, we delivered positive year-over-year Pro growth in the back half of the first quarter and anticipate high single digits at for the Pro paint business for the full year as consumers continue to become more comfortable with paint contractors in their homes. Others Hardware and Lighting businesses each delivered double-digit growth as their new products and programs capitalized on increased consumer demand. 
Operating profit in the quarter was $142 million, up [indiscernible] or 48%. This outstanding performance was driven by incremental volume, cost productivity initiatives and lower spend, partially offset by an unfavorable price cost relationship. For 2021, we are raising our outlook and now expect Decorative Architectural segment sales growth will be in the range of 4% to 9% with 3% to 7% organic growth and another 1.5% from acquisitions. We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19%. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x, and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 17.5%. 
During the first quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by deploying approximately $303 million to repurchase 5.5 million shares. 
In mid-February, we completed a significant bond refinancing. In this transaction, we called our 2022, our 2025 and our 2026 debt maturities, which aggregated $1.3 billion, refinance these with a combination of new 7-year, 10-year and 30-year notes totaling $1.5 billion. This refinancing accomplished 2 things: First, it lowered our interest expense. And secondly, we extended the duration of our maturities. 
From an interest perspective, the net effect is a $35 million annualized interest savings. Due to the timing of this transaction, interest expense will be approximately $110 million compared to our previous guidance of $135 million for 2021. It will be approximately $100 million in 2022. 
From a maturity perspective, this transaction also means we have taken out all our near-term maturities, and our next debt maturity is not until 2027. 
And 2 reminders for everyone. First, we will be terminating and annuitizing our U.S. defined benefit plans in the second quarter, and we will have an approximate $140 million final cash contribution to these plans to complete this activity. And second, our Board previously announced its intention to increase our annual dividend by 68% to $0.94 per share starting in the second quarter of 2021. This will increase our targeted dividend payout ratio from 20% to 30%. 
We have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 13 in our earnings deck. Based on Q1 performance and current robust demand for our products, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 10% to 14%, up from 7% to 11%, with operating margins of approximately 17%. 
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 EPS estimate of $3.50 to $3.70 represents 15% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 254 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith."

Furthermore, the U.S. consumer is healthy, with estimated built up savings of nearly $2 trillion even before the new stimulus money, and consumers continue to invest in their homes. 
We believe these factors, along with the increased demand from the large millennial demographic will lead to continued growth in the repair and remodel markets.

And my question is, as we do get further into the year, late April now, is it becoming clear that the backlog of home improvement activity and what consumers are doing may not exactly shift overnight and maybe that tough comps in the second half, you guys had previously spoken to, might have a little bit better outlook, just a similar kind of question there on the organic side."

But you had said, I think, that you're expecting neutrality on input costs by year-end, which I think is pretty much what you thought before. So just to get a sense for the arc of margins through the quarter relative to your previous expectations, are we looking at kind of maybe lower margins in 2Q and 3Q than you had previously thought but then higher in 4Q as you get the neutrality back?

Now that said, you may have heard in Keith's remarks, we talked about receiving some proceeds from the sale of cabinet works. That also then contemplates -- we need to update our guidance to reflect the fact that we will not be getting interest income from that investment. So I think the net benefit there is, call it, $0.02, $0.03. So -- well, I just want to make sure we're clear on that. So as you think about our rate, it's both the first quarter B+, the net impact of interest for the year. 
Now with respect to your second part of your question about price cost neutrality, yes, you're correct. What we're committing to is exiting the year being price cost neutral. 
In terms of how that actually plays out through the course of the year, we're having pricing conversations with our customers. And so can't really give you a good clear signal as to when those are all going to flow through and hit the P&L. So I don't want to -- I'm not going to give -- we're not going to give clear guidance on Q2, Q3 or Q4, exactly how that flows through because those conversations are fluid."

In terms of -- while we don't normally see this kind of significant commodity changes occurring this quickly. We certainly are no strangers to commodity changes. And this is really part of our business. And we've consistently communicated on and more importantly, I think, demonstrated our ability to reach price cost neutrality through cycles. And this is included garden-variety sort of changes in costs related to the relationship between supply and demand. It's included force majeure kind of spikes in, in cost and as well as tariffs, which was quite a spike that we were able to cover. So our price cost neutrality capability is really underpinned by this consistent investment that we've had in our brands and innovation and customer programs and the like, as well as our well-developed ability to drive total cost productivity and to ultimately deliver value to our customers and consumers that they recognize.

So John, as you referencing, we're seeing both inflation in our raw material baskets, really across the enterprise as well as transportation and logistics. And if you think about this -- how we're being impacted, obviously, copper, zinc in the resins that go into paint and packaging have been up pretty significantly. As you -- to get to your question specifically, as you break apart the impacts on the financial statements from either raw materials or transportation and logistics, the vast majority of the impact comes from the raw material basket. If you think about distribution and logistics, it's a relatively small part of our overall cost structure. 
That said, and I guess I can repeat your statement. We do continue to expect inflation to be up kind of mid-single digits for the full year in both segments and up high single digits in the second half of the year. And as Keith alluded to, we've secured price increases across our product categories. And we do have plans for further price increases to offset the persistent inflation that we've been experiencing. That said, we're not going to shy away. We're going to continue to implement cost productivity improvements across the enterprise as well. And then work with both our customers and suppliers to continue to try to offset this inflation. 
So as we said earlier in response to Stephen's question, we do expect to be price cost-neutral as we exit 2021."

In other words, it seems like in a perfect world, if you had higher inflation, but you're putting through price increases to offset that, that should be a wash. So are we going to take this that there's this continued lag in price cost that you're still maybe chasing is the wrong word?

And we also continue to expect rather, to continue to gain share. We believe that we're the leader in plumbing and the e-com market. And we've worked on a number of things to build and maintain that leadership, Susan. Product offering, obviously, is one. We have put our best and brightest talent on this. We are working very hard across our business unit to leverage learnings quickly to leverage platform like product data management and IT space to leverage the sharing of ratings and reviews to really understand what it takes to be on that first page and to get that second and third click. We're working hard to understand how to drive digital content and 360-degree spends. We're doing a ton of stuff there. 
And also, we're investing capital. We made an acquisition of one of the leading digitally-native brands in Crouse. And Crouse is a company that makes, I would say, more modern design, sinks and faucets and the like. And we're learning a lot from them, and we're helping them be all they can be as well. So a combination of capital deployment, talent, products, IT, leverage, et cetera. This is important for us, and it's paying off. And we've been working at this hard now for 5 years."

And it's not just on the plant floor, it's also in the administrative part of the operations. And we challenge our teams every year to get more efficient in a variety of ways.

We get that conversion efficiency is very helpful to us. Obviously, there's direct labor productivity. We have hired a lot of people and as those people become more familiar with our systems and how to work, that naturally drives productivity. We're consistently and constantly looking for material substitution and value engineering where we can take a 4-part assembly and make it a 2-part machine or injection molding, that sort of thing. So it's really a combination of shop floor labor productivity, working with our suppliers and making sure that we have the most cost-effective way to customer requirements, so we don't want to mess or miss any customer requirements.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. While we are well over a year into this pandemic, the effects are still being felt. We are encouraged by the rollout of vaccines, but",961,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. While we are well over a year into this pandemic, the effects are still being felt. We are encouraged by the rollout of vaccines, but many areas around the globe continue to experience a surge in cases. The safety of our employees remains our #1 priority. And I would like to thank all our employees for keeping each other safe and for serving our customers. Through the efforts of our employees and the robust demand we continue to experience for our products, we delivered another outstanding quarter.
Please turn to Slide 5. We had a strong start to 2021, and our ability to effectively navigate this highly-dynamic environment resulted in exceptional top and bottom line growth. For the quarter, sales increased 25%. Excluding acquisitions and currency, sales increased 19%. Operating profit increased 61% to $366 million, principally due to strong volume leverage and reduced spending in the form of lower travel, entertainment and marketing expenses across our segments. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 89%.
Turning to our Plumbing segment. Sales grew 27%, excluding currency, driven by strong volume growth at Hansgrohe, Delta and Watkins. Our 2 recent Plumbing acquisitions performed well in the quarter and contributed 5% to Plumbing's growth. North American plumbing grew 28%, led by our wellness business, which continued to experience strong demand and begin to comp their March shutdown of 2020. Delta Faucet delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, with strength across all channels, particularly e-commerce, which showed exceptional strength as consumers continue to shift their buying patterns to online. International plumbing grew 37% in the quarter as many of our markets returned to strong growth, with particular strength in Central Europe and China.  
In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 15% against a healthy 9% comp from Q1 of 2020. Acquisitions contributed 2% to our Decorative growth. Our lighting, bath & cabinet hardware and paint businesses each posted double-digit growth during the quarter. DIY paint grew high teens in the quarter, which is impressive, considering it was facing a strong double-digit comp in Q1 of 2020. While pro paint was down low single digits for the quarter, as it faced a tough comp in Q1 of 2020, we did see a return to positive growth in the back half of the quarter, and we're encouraged by the momentum we are now seeing in this business as we move into Q2.  
Lastly, we actively continued our share repurchases during the quarter by repurchasing 5.5 million shares for $303 million. We anticipate deploying approximately $800 million towards share repurchases or acquisitions for the full year as we guided on our fourth quarter call. In addition, we anticipate receiving approximately $160 million for our preferred stock in cabinet works, resulting from their recently announced transaction, assuming it closes as expected. We intend to deploy these funds towards share repurchases or acquisitions, which would be in addition to the $800 million that I just mentioned.  
Now let me discuss 2 issues that are top of mind right now, inflation and supply chain tightness. We have seen significant inflation in the raw materials, namely copper, zinc and resin used in both our paint and plumbing businesses, as well as increases in freight costs. All in, we expect our raw material and freight cost to be up in the mid single-digit range for the full year for both our Plumbing and Decorative segments, with inflation likely reaching high-single-digit levels in both segments in the third and fourth quarters. 
To mitigate these impacts, we have secured price increases across both segments to begin offsetting these costs. We have further actions planned, including additional price increases, and productivity improvements, while continuing to work with our customers and suppliers to offset these rising costs. Time and again, we have demonstrated that our strong brands, innovation pipelines and channel relationships gives us the ability to offset rising costs. We expect to continue this track record and achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end. And we are maintaining our full year margin expectations in both segments that we provided on our fourth quarter call.  
With respect to supply chain tightness, in addition to the strain caused by robust demand, we have been impacted by significant disruption in the supply of resins and related products in both our plumbing and paint businesses due to the severe weather that Texas experienced in February. Additionally, ocean container availability and timeliness continues to be constrained. This has temporarily reduced output of certain spot products during the month of April and limited our ability to build certain -- to build inventory of certain architectural coatings and other products. 
However, the availability of resins is improving. And our teams have done an outstanding job utilizing Masco's size, scale and agility to countermeasure these issues by working with our key suppliers to increase availability of certain materials, by leveraging our purchasing power to increase container availability for our products and by working around the clock to adjust production to meet the needs of our customers. This once again shows the competitive advantage that comes from being part of Masco's portfolio.
With our strong first quarter performance, the actions we have taken and will take to offset persistent inflation, the interest savings from our recent bond transaction and the continued strong demand for our products in innovative -- and products and brands, excuse me, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. This is up from our previous expectations of $3.25 to $3.45.  
With that, I'll now turn it over to John for additional detail on our first quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. Turning to Slide 7. We delivered a very strong start to the year as first quarter sales increased 25%. Currency increased sales by 2% in the quarter, and the 3 recently completed acquisitions contributed an additional 4% to growth. 
In local currency, North American sales increased 21% or 17% excluding acquisitions. This outstanding performance was driven by strong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas as well as DIY paint. In local currency, international sales increased 27% or 23% excluding acquisitions. Gross margin was 35.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points as we leveraged the increased volume. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 340 basis points to 17% in the quarter. This was primarily due to operating leverage, decreases in certain costs such as travel and entertainment and trade shows and the deferral of certain marketing and other spend. 
We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase throughout the year to a more normalized 18% as certain costs come back, along with additional investments in our brands, service and innovation to fuel future growth. We delivered an outstanding first quarter operating profit of $366 million, up $138 million or 61% from last year, with operating margins expanding 420 basis points to 18.6%. Our EPS was $0.89 in the quarter, an increase of 89% compared to the first quarter of 2020.  
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing grew 31% in the quarter. Currency contributed 4% to this growth and acquisitions contributed another 5%. North American sales increased 27% in local currency or 22% excluding acquisitions. This was led by Delta's double-digit growth in the quarter as they continue to drive strong consumer demand across all their product categories and channels. Watkins, our wellness business, was also a significant contributor to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remained strong. 
Watkins' performance also benefited from a softer comp in the first quarter of last year, as government-mandated COVID lockdowns resulted in 2 of their manufacturing plants being temporarily shut in 2020. International plumbing sales increased 27% in local currency or 23% excluding acquisitions. Hansgrohe delivered year-over-year increases across most of their markets with continued double-digit growth in both Germany and China. Demand remains strong in Central Europe despite continued COVID restrictions, and we are starting to see improvement in the U.K.  
Operating profit was $253 million in the quarter, up $94 million or 59%, with operating margins expanding 370 basis points to 20.3%. This strong performance was driven by incremental volume, cost productivity initiatives and lower spend on items such as travel and entertainment, trade shows and marketing. This favorability was partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship. We expect raw material inflation in this segment to peak in the third quarter.  
During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest our HÜPPE business, a small shower enclosure business based in Germany as we determined it did not align with our strategic direction. HÜPPE's sales were approximately EUR 70 million in 2020. Net proceeds will not be material. Given our first quarter results and the current demand trends, we now expect Plumbing segment sales growth for 2021 to be in the 15% to 18% range with 10% to 13% organic growth, another 3% net growth from the recent acquisitions and then the divestiture of HÜPPE. And given current exchange rates, we anticipate foreign currency to favorably benefit Plumbing revenue by approximately 2% or $70 million. We continue to anticipate full year margins will be approximately 18%.
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural grew 15% for the first quarter or 13% excluding acquisitions. This exceptional performance was driven by low teens growth in our paint business. Our DIY paint business grew high teens against a strong double-digit comp in the first quarter of 2020. Our pro business also faced a strong comp and declined low single digits in the quarter. Despite this decline in our pro paint business, we delivered positive year-over-year pro growth in the back half of the first quarter and anticipate high single digit growth for the pro paint business for the full year as consumers continue to become more comfortable with paint contractors in their homes. Our builders' hardware and lighting businesses each delivered double-digit growth as their new products and programs capitalized on increased consumer demand.  
Operating profit in the quarter was $142 million, up $46 million or 48%. This outstanding performance was driven by incremental volume, cost productivity initiatives and lower spend, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship. For 2021, we are raising our outlook and now expect Decorative Architectural segment sales growth will be in the range of 4% to 9% with 3% to 7% organic growth and another 1.5% from acquisitions. We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19%.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x, and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 17.5%. During the first quarter, we continued our focus on shareholder value creation by deploying approximately $303 million to repurchase 5.5 million shares. 
In mid-February, we completed a significant bond refinancing. In this transaction, we called our 2022, our 2025 and our 2026 debt maturities, which aggregated $1.3 billion, refinanced these with a combination of new 7-year, 10-year and 30-year notes totaling $1.5 billion. This refinancing accomplished 2 things: first, it lowered our interest expense; and secondly, extended the duration of our maturities.  
From an interest perspective, the net effect is a $35 million annualized interest savings. Due to the timing of this transaction, interest expense will be approximately $110 million compared to our previous guidance of $135 million for 2021. It will be approximately $100 million in 2022. From a maturity perspective, this transaction also means we have taken out all our near-term maturities, and our next debt maturity is not until 2027.  
And 2 reminders for everyone. First, we will be terminating and annuitizing our U.S. defined benefit plans in the second quarter, and we will have an approximate $140 million final cash contribution to these plans to complete this activity. And second, our Board previously announced its intention to increase our annual dividend by 68% to $0.94 per share starting in the second quarter of 2021. This will increase our targeted dividend payout ratio from 20% to 30%.  
We have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 13 in our earnings deck. Based on Q1 performance and current robust demand for our products, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 10% to 14%, up from 7% to 11%, with operating margins of approximately 17%. Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 EPS estimate of $3.50 to $3.70 represents 15% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 254 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck.  
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith."

Our markets remain strong, and housing fundamentals are supportive of continued long-term growth. Year-over-year home price appreciation increased to over 17% in March and existing home sales were up over 12%. Both of these metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis. Furthermore, the U.S. consumer is healthy, with estimated built up savings of nearly $2 trillion even before the new stimulus money, and consumers continue to invest in their homes. We believe these factors, along with the increased demand from the large millennial demographic, will lead to continued growth in the repair and remodel markets. With our market-leading brands, history of innovation and strong management teams, we are well positioned to capitalize on these growth drivers, serve our customers and deliver value to the shareholders.

One, I do think because we raised our top line guidance, we now are anticipating a little bit better volume than we anticipated. At the same time, what we are seeing is a little bit more inflation. And so what -- I think the 2 kind of offset each other. And that's what's causing us to maintain our margin guidance at 17% as we called out on our Q4 call."

But more broadly, you guys have talked about North American R&R, for example, up low single digits this year. You talked about tougher comps in the second half. And my question is, as we do get further into the year, late April now, is it becoming clear that the backlog of home improvement activity and what consumers are doing may not exactly shift overnight? And maybe that tough comps in the second half you guys had previously spoken to might have a little bit better outlook? Just a similar kind of question there on the organic side."

So nothing is going to move those tough comps in the back half. They're still there, and we have to face them. But when we look at how demand is shaping up both in the quarter and then what we expect going forward and the fundamentals, that really was the rationale for us lifting our guide on the revenue side."

I just want to throw in that you also had the refinancing of the debt, probably adds about $0.09 for the full year. Just wanted to get an idea whether that had previously been contemplated in your guide? And then if I heard your answer, John, it sounds like it's higher inputs, which is totally understandable. But you had said, I think, that you're expecting neutrality on input costs by year-end, which I think is pretty much what you thought before. So just to get a sense for the arc of margins through the quarter relative to your previous expectations, are we looking at kind of maybe lower margins in 2Q and 3Q than you had previously thought but then higher in 4Q as you get the neutrality back? And then, of course, you did better in 1Q as well. Is that the kind of the way we should be thinking about the trajectory of margins relative to your previous expectation?"

Now that said,",245,"Yes. So a couple of questions there, Steve. Let me try to address those. So first of all, with respect to the interest savings, I think for this year, given the timing of that transaction, it's probably about a $0.05, $0.06 benefit in 2021. Now that said, you may have heard in Keith's remarks, we talked about receiving some proceeds from the sale of cabinet works. That also then contemplates -- we need to update our guidance to reflect the fact that we will not be getting interest income from that investment. So I think the net benefit there is, call it, $0.02, $0.03. So -- well, I just want to make sure we're clear on that. So as you think about our rate, it's both the first quarter B+, the net impact of interest for the year.  
Now with respect to your second part of your question about price/cost neutrality, yes, you're correct. What we're committing to is exiting the year at being price/cost neutral. In terms of how that actually plays out through the course of the year, we're having pricing conversations with our customers. And so can't really give you a good clear signal as to when those are all going to flow through and hit the P&L. So I don't want to -- I'm not going to give -- we're not going to give clear guidance on Q2, Q3 or Q4, exactly how that flows through because those conversations are fluid."

It's included force majeure kind of spikes in cost and as well as tariffs, which was quite a spike that we were able to cover.

So John, as you referenced, we're seeing both inflation in our raw material baskets, really across the enterprise as well as transportation and logistics.

As you -- to get to your question specifically, as you break apart the impacts on the financial statements from either raw materials or transportation and logistics, the vast majority of impact comes from the raw material basket. If you think about distribution and logistics, it's a relatively small part of our overall cost structure.  
That said -- and I guess I can repeat your statement. We do continue to expect inflation to be up kind of mid-single digits for the full year in both segments and up high single digits in the second half of the year. And as Keith alluded to, we've secured price increases across our product categories. We do have plans for further price increases to offset the persistent inflation that we've been experiencing. That said, we're not going to shy away. We're going to continue to implement cost productivity improvements across the enterprise as well and then work with both our customers and suppliers to continue to try to offset this inflation.

In other words, it seems like in a perfect world, if you had higher inflation, but you're putting through price increases to offset that, that should be a wash. So are we going to take this that there's this continued lag in price/cost that you're still -- maybe chasing is the wrong word?

Having said that, we're still working through some tightness.

But we do know that we have a strong mix of DIY -- excuse me, of, call it, retail and wholesale in plumbing. Over half of our business is in wholesale, and wholesale certainly skews more towards the pro than DIY. So we feel real good about the mix of that business, in terms of being there to catch improvements in demand, be it on the pro side or on the DIY side. We all know about the strength of DIY. And we expect the pro to start to come back as people are more comfortable having pros in their homes as vaccinations roll out. 
Specifically to your question of demand, it really has been broad-based across all channels. Real good strength in e-commerce and continued strength in both plumbing wholesale as well as the retail, where we lead in terms of share of shelf position. So that's been really good for us. And international is a nice story. International, we talked about the strong growth rate there, our position in Central Europe. China is doing very well, understanding that there was a relatively easy comp there. But all in, it's been pretty broad-based, and that all feeds into why we've raised our confidence level in our guide."

Now in terms of the impact of how this could play out in future quarters or into next year, it's a real volatile environment.

In terms of our productivity measures, I'll start and maybe kick it over to Keith to clarify. But our teams have done a great job over multiple years of driving productivity within our operations. And it's not just on the plant floor. It's also in the administrative part of the operations. And we challenge our teams every year to get more efficient in a variety of ways. And so we do have TCP goals for every -- total cost productivity goals for each of our businesses. Keith, do you want to give some examples?"

I think from a dollars and cents perspective, the greatest productivity comes from volume leverage. And when you look at our consistent and steady and repeatable drop down, say it's 30%-ish in incremental volume for Plumbing and maybe closer to 25% in the Deco segment. That conversion efficiency is very helpful to us. Obviously, there's direct labor productivity. We have hired a lot of people. And as those people become more familiar with our systems and how to work, that naturally drives productivity. 
We're consistently and constantly looking for material substitution and value engineering where we can take a 4-part assembly and make it a 2-part machine or injection molding, that sort of thing. So it's really a combination of shop floor and labor productivity, working with our suppliers and making sure that we have the most cost-effective way to meet customer requirements, so we don't want to mess or miss any customer requirements. So it's really all part and parcel of the Masco operating system with a good dose of volume leverage."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This resulted in our fourth consecut",1132,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. 
We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth. I'm extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth. 
For the quarter, sales increased 24%. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased 18%. Operating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to strong volume leverage. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 34%. 
Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower-ticket repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the professional. 
Turning to our plumbing segment. Sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business. International Plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency as Hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets. Strong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets. 
New product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR 1 collection in the second half of the year. This collection was designed by [ Barbara Osgoby ], an award-winning internationally acclaimed London-based industrial design studio. This continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality. 
North American Plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double-digit growth at Delta. 
Delta Faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels and particular strength in the professionally oriented trade channel. We continue to invest in new products in North American plumbing as well. And 2 days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd [indiscernible] by Brizo that furthers the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products. 
Lastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steam Mist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta. Steam Mist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy. 
In our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against a healthy 8% comp for the second quarter of 2020. While bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and Pro paint grew in the quarter, demand moderated for DIY paint. 
Material availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter. Because of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter. 
Due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales, and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low single digits for the full year. However, with the acceleration we saw in our Pro paint business in the quarter, we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low double-digit growth from high single digit for the full year for our Pro paint business. 
For the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year. 
With respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high-end line of paint in the third quarter at The Home Depot called Behr Dynasty for both DIY and Pro painters. Dynasty is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff-resistant, one coat high paint ever. It's low VOC, GREENGUARD and LEED-certified, fast-drying and has an antimicrobial mildew-resistant paint finish. This is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional. 
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million. As part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million. This is approximately 5% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year. 
Underscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately $1 billion. 
Finally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update of what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness. We continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging. 
Inbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter. 
We now expect our all-in cost inflation to be in the high single-digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low double-digit inflation in the second half of the year. Inflation and coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later in the fourth quarter. 
To mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations. We are also working with our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs. 
Despite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end. While cost inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business. Our teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers. 
However, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products in the channel that we serve. We anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over time. 
The demand for our products remain strong, and with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional detail on our second quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs. As a result, sales increased 24% with currency and net acquisitions each contributing 3% to growth. 
In local currency, North American sales increased 15%, or 12% excluding acquisitions. Strong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas led this outstanding performance. 
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 50% or 49%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Gross margin was 36.3% in the quarter, up 50 basis points as we leveraged the strong volume growth. 
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage. 
During the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing and travel and entertainment increased as planned. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters as these costs normalize. 
We delivered strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, up $94 million or 27% from last year, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20.1%. 
Our EPS was $1.14 in the quarter, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to volume leverage, lower interest expense and lower share count. 
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth accelerated in the quarter, with sales up 53%. Currency contributed 5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed another 4%. 
North American sales increased 47% in local currency or 41%, excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth. 
With its strong brand recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels. 
Watkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong. 
International plumbing sales increased 50% in local currency or 49%, excluding the acquisitions and divestitures. Hansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and numerous other countries. Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, U.K. and France, all grew strong double digits in the quarter. 
Segment operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of $274 million, up $115 million or 72%. This strong performance was driven by incremental volume, and favorable mix, and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing and growth initiatives. 
During the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of [ Hoopa ], a small shower enclosure business based in Germany. Hoopa sales were approximately EUR 70 million in 2020. This transaction closed on May 31 and net proceeds were not material. 
Given our second quarter results and current demand trends, we now expect plumbing segment sales growth for 2021 to be in the 22% to 24% range, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%. 
Finally, due to our improved sales outlook, we are increasing our full year margin expectations to approximately 18.5%, up from our previous guide of approximately 18%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural declined 5% for the second quarter or 6%, excluding the benefit from acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined double digits in the quarter against a healthy high teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in the first quarter continue to face production challenges. We expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter, and now anticipate our DIY business to be down low single digits for the full year. 
To help mitigate these challenges, we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources for materials to meet the demand of our customers, which remains strong. I want to thank our supply chain teams, which have done an outstanding job managing through these challenges. 
Our Pro paint business delivered strong double-digits growth in the quarter as consumers are increasingly willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong and now anticipate low double-digit growth for the Pro paint business for the full year, up from our previous expectation of high single digits as Pro paint contractors order books continue to grow. 
Our [indiscernible] hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter as they continue to capitalize on increased consumer demand. 
Segment operating margins were 22.1% and operating profit in the quarter was $188 million due to lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity initiatives. 
For full year 2021, we now expect Decorative Architectural segment sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%, down from 4% to 9% due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales in persistent raw material constraints. 
We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19% as productivity initiatives and pricing help offset higher input costs. 
And turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. 
Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over prior year. 
As we discussed last quarter, we terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the second quarter and had an approximate $100 million final cash contribution to the plans to complete this activity. This removes approximately $140 million of pension liability from our balance sheet and will benefit our free cash flow by approximately $50 million to reduce cash contributions starting in 2022. 
Also, we received approximately $166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, as of today, we repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750 million. We expect to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the remainder of this year. 
Collectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. Based on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14%, with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from 17%. 
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 EPS estimate range of $3.65 to $3.75, represents 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the full year. 
Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 in our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our strong performance demonstrates the strength of Masco's balanced and diversified business. Masco is a broad portfolio of lower ticket repair and remodel-oriented home improvement products. Our products are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals. 
Additionally, our markets remain strong, and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in 2022.

And nearly all of our resins, as I mentioned, where suppliers were operating under a force and reserve declaration in the second quarter. There was a planned explosion, in addition, at a supplier that supplies our alkylate resin, but really for the industry, but that affected us. 
So we do expect -- while they're not over yet, we do expect these material availability issues to persist in the third quarter and then slowly improve.

Given our guide, it does imply a little bit of a step down in margin in the back half of the year. We're pleased with how we've executed so far. 
But as we mentioned on previous calls, we do need to put some money back into the business in the form of investments. And they'll take the form of travel and entertainment, as I mentioned, but they also take the form of some growth initiatives. 
And you may recall in some of our prior calls, we said that we thought in 2020 that we may have delayed as much as $40 million of investment spend, just to make sure we affordably contain costs as we were going through the pandemic. And so as we see things begin to improve here significantly, we continue to expect that some of that spend will return. And as I mentioned in my remarks, some of that spend actually started to return in the second quarter as we began to make some investments in marketing and growth initiatives. 
So we believe that a lot of that spend will start to come back in the second half of the year. And that will take additional investment in our leading brands. Some of the innovation that Keith mentioned in his prepared remarks in service to ensure that our customers are in full supply of our products. 
And so we think that will also contribute to future growth of the business to better meet our customers' needs. At the same time, as we kind of alluded to in our prepared remarks, there's going to be a little bit of a price/cost headwind as we go into the back half of the year. We've always talked about a little bit of a lag in getting and price and cost flowing through our P&L. And generally, in the plumbing segment, it's about a 2-quarter lag. And so that's the second piece that will impact the margins in the back half of the year. 
So those 2, a little bit of an incremental spend and then also that price/cost lag. That said, we are very confident that we'll be price/cost neutral as we exit the year."

In terms of channel shift, we pride ourselves on having broad distribution across multiple channels. When you look at our -- you're talking coatings now, but if we look at plumbing, we have very strong position in retail, which is both a Pro and a consumer channel. We have a leading position in trade, which is principally more oriented towards the Pro. And then an e-commerce, which is mainly consumer, we have a leading position there. 
Similar story when we look at coatings, where we have a strong Pro franchise as well as we always talk about, the strong DIY. 
So we like our positioning of where we are in terms of broad channel distribution. So that if there are particular shifts, be it Pro to DIY, or online to trade, et cetera, we have it covered. And I think that's a good significant reason why we're able to perform in this dynamic environment. 
In addition to our strong teams that have been able to address these issues, we're where our customer wants to buy, and we're quite agnostic to these kind of shifts if they happen."

So it's -- we're in the throes of the pandemic, maybe you'd let an appliance repair person in for a quick repair, but you certainly wouldn't want someone in for a major remodel. That's changing. 
And that principally, not totally, but principally flows through our trade channel. So we're seeing a nice pickup in the trade channel. 
Having said that, the dynamic of more and more Pros buying in retail is very real. Certainly seeing good foot traffic in retail. And our e-commerce business continues to do very well. And our acquisition, as John spoke about of Kraus is really going well. We've continued to invest in that. For example, we just launched a Delta-branded sinks online, utilizing the Kraus offering with the Delta brand. That's real leverage, and that's going well. 
So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing broad-based solid market demand and growth, international, domestic, trade, retail, e-commerce, we're really hitting on all cylinders."

And so if you think about 2019, our e-commerce sales as a percent of our total sales were roughly 5%. And in 2020, that grew nicely. It's now -- we finished 2020 at about 9%. 
And if you break that down by segment, our Plumbing Product sales were roughly 12% on the e-commerce platform or channel. And as you might expect, and you kind of alluded to in your question, a little bit lower than that in the Decorative Architectural segment, about 4% because of all the things you cited. Color selection is a challenge for people still to order paint online. So we do have -- I would say that the Behr team has done a nice job of investing in shipping and distribution and fulfillment. And so that's not going to be a limiter to our ability to transact online. It's more of the consumer choosing to select the color online than anything else. 
And as we look forward, we think we're well positioned to continue to grow our e-commerce presence. Because if you consider plumbing products, they're packaged perfectly to ship onesies, twosies to consumers as they or their faucets or shower heads online. And so we think we're in a great position to do that. The focus on a Delta have done a great job of adding the capability of the Jackson distribution centers to fulfill online. So we feel really good about how we were set to serve plumbing growth going forward. 
And to the extent that the paint continues to become more sought online, we're well positioned to continue to fulfill there as well. So we really like how we're set up as this trend continues to grow here in North America."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.  We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This resulted in our fourth consecu",1129,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.  
We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth. I'm extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth.  
For the quarter, sales increased 24%. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased 18%. Operating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to strong volume leverage. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 34%.  
Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the professional.  
Turning to our plumbing segment. Sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business. International plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency as Hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets. Strong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets.  
New product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR One collection in the second half of the year. This collection was designed by Barber Osgerby, an award-winning internationally acclaimed London-based industrial design studio. This continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality.  
North American plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double-digit growth at Delta.  
Delta Faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels and particular strength in the professionally oriented trade channel. We continue to invest in new products in North American plumbing as well. And 2 days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd Wright by Brizo that furthers the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.  
Lastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steamist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta. Steamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.  
In our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against a healthy 8% comp for the second quarter of 2020. While bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and pro paint grew in the quarter, demand moderated for DIY paint.  
Material availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter. Because of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter.  
Due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales, and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low single digits for the full year. However, with the acceleration we saw in our pro paint business in the quarter, we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low double-digit growth from high single digit for the full year for our pro paint business.  
For the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year.  
With respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high-end line of paint in the third quarter at The Home Depot called BEHR DYNASTY for both DIY and pro painters. DYNASTY is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff-resistant, one-coat hide paint ever. It's low VOC, GREENGUARD and LEED-certified, fast-drying and has an antimicrobial mildew-resistant paint finish. This is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional.  
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million. As part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million. This is approximately 5% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year.  
Underscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately $1 billion.  
Finally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update of what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness. We continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging.  
Inbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter. We now expect our all-in cost inflation to be in the high single-digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low double-digit inflation in the second half of the year. Inflation in coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later in the fourth quarter.  
To mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations. We are also working with our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs.  
Despite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end. While cost inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business. Our teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers.  
However, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products in the channels that we serve. We anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over this time.  
The demand for our products remained strong, and with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional detail on our second quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.  
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs. As a result, sales increased 24% with currency and net acquisitions each contributing 3% to growth.  
In local currency, North American sales increased 15% or 12% excluding acquisitions. Strong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas led this outstanding performance.  
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 50% or 49% excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Gross margin was 36.3% in the quarter, up 50 basis points as we leveraged the strong volume growth.  
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage.  
During the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing and travel and entertainment increased as planned. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters as these costs normalize.  
We delivered strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, up $94 million or 27% from last year, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20.1%.  
Our EPS was $1.14 in the quarter, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to volume leverage, lower interest expense and lower share count.  
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth accelerated in the quarter, with sales up 53%. Currency contributed 5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed another 4%.  
North American sales increased 47% in local currency or 41% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth. With its strong brand recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.  
Watkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong.  
International plumbing sales increased 50% in local currency or 49% excluding the acquisitions and divestitures. Hansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and numerous other countries. Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, U.K. and France, all grew strong double digits in the quarter.  
Segment operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of $274 million, up $115 million or 72%. This strong performance was driven by incremental volume and favorable mix and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing and growth initiatives.  
During the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of HÜPPE, a small shower enclosure business based in Germany. HÜPPE sales were approximately EUR 70 million in 2020. This transaction closed on May 31 and net proceeds were not material.  
Given our second quarter results and current demand trends, we now expect plumbing segment sales growth for 2021 to be in the 22% to 24% range, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%. 
Finally, due to our improved sales outlook, we are increasing our full year margin expectations to approximately 18.5%, up from our previous guide of approximately 18%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative architectural declined 5% for the second quarter or 6% excluding the benefit from acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined double digits in the quarter against a healthy high teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in the first quarter continue to face production challenges. We expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter and now anticipate our DIY paint business to be down low single digits for the full year. 
To help mitigate these challenges, we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources for materials to meet the demand of our customers, which remains strong. I want to thank our supply chain teams, which have done an outstanding job managing through these challenges. 
Our pro paint business delivered strong double-digits growth in the quarter as consumers are increasingly willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong and now anticipate low double-digit growth for the pro paint business for the full year, up from our previous expectation of high single digits as pro paint contractors' order books continue to grow. 
Our builders' hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter as they continue to capitalize on increased consumer demand. 
Segment operating margins were 22.1% and operating profit in the quarter was $188 million due to lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity initiatives. 
For full year 2021, we now expect decorative architectural segment's sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%, down from 4% to 9% due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales and persistent raw material constraints. 
We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19% as productivity initiatives and pricing help offset higher input costs. 
And turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. 
Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over prior year. 
As we discussed last quarter, we had terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified -- defined benefit plans in the second quarter and had an approximate $100 million final cash contribution to the plans to complete this activity. This removes approximately $140 million of pension liabilities from our balance sheet and will benefit our free cash flow by approximately $50 million to reduce cash contributions starting in 2022. 
Also, we received approximately $166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, as of today, we repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750 million. We expect to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the remainder of this year. 
Collectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. Based on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14%, with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from 17%. 
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 EPS estimate range of $3.65 to $3.75, represents 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the full year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 in our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our strong performance demonstrates the strength of Masco's balanced and diversified business. Masco is a broad portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel-oriented home improvement products. Our products are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals. 
Additionally, our markets remain strong, and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in 2022. 
The fundamentals of our repair and remodel business are strong, with year-over-year home price appreciation of over 15% in May and existing home sales up over 23%. Both metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis. And the consumer is strong with nearly $2 trillion in savings and an increased desire to invest in their homes. 
Lastly, we continue to invest in our business and are well positioned for long-term growth. We are bringing new, innovative products to market, fueling our growth and expanding our leading market share.

The impact of the storms in Texas in the Gulf Coast region continue to limit resin supply. But really, this is an industry-wide phenomenon. And nearly all of our resins, as I mentioned, where suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration in the second quarter. There was a plant explosion, in addition, at a supplier that supplies our [ alkyd resin ], really for the industry, but that affected us.

Given our guide, it does imply a little bit of a step down in margin in the back half of the year. We're pleased with how we've executed so far. 
But as we mentioned on previous calls, we do need to put some money back into the business in the form of investments. And they'll take the form of travel and entertainment, as I mentioned, but they also take the form of some growth initiatives. 
And you may recall in some of our prior calls, we said that we thought in 2020 that we may have delayed as much as $40 million of investment spend, just to make sure we appropriately contain costs as we were going through the pandemic. And so as we see things begin to improve here significantly, we continue to expect that some of that spend will return. And as I mentioned in my remarks, some of that spend actually started to return in the second quarter as we began to make some investments in marketing and growth initiatives. 
So we believe that a lot of that spend will start to come back in the second half of the year. And that will take additional investment in our leading brands. Some of the innovation that Keith mentioned in his prepared remarks in service to ensure that our customers are in full supply of our products. 
And so we think that, that will also contribute to future growth of the business to better meet our customers' needs. At the same time, as we kind of alluded to in our prepared remarks, there's going to be a little bit of a price/cost headwind as we go into the back half of the year. We've always talked about a little bit of a lag in getting price and cost flowing through our P&L. And generally, in the plumbing segment, it's about a 2-quarter lag. And so that's the second piece that will impact the margins in the back half of the year. 
So those 2, a little bit of an incremental spend and then also that price/cost lag. That said, we are very confident that we'll be price/cost-neutral as we exit the year."

In terms of channel shift, we pride ourselves on having broad distribution across multiple channels. When you look at our -- you're talking coatings now, but if we look at plumbing, we have very strong position in retail, which is both a pro and a consumer channel. We have a leading position in trade, which is principally more oriented towards the pro. And then in e-commerce, which is mainly consumer, we have a leading position there. 
Similar story when we look at coatings, where we have a strong pro franchise as well as we always talk about, the strong DIY. 
So we like our positioning of where we are in terms of broad channel distribution. So that if there are particular shifts, be it pro to DIY, or online to trade, et cetera, we have it covered. And I think that's a good, significant reason why we're able to perform in this dynamic environment.

People are more comfortable with pros coming into their home for a longer time. So it's -- we're in the throes of the pandemic, maybe you'd let an appliance repair person in for a quick repair, but you certainly wouldn't want someone in for a major remodel. That's changing. 
And that principally, not totally, but principally flows through our trade channel. So we're seeing a nice pickup in the trade channel. 
Having said that, the dynamic of more and more pros buying in retail is very real. Certainly seeing good foot traffic in retail. And our e-commerce business continues to do very well. And our acquisition, as John spoke about, of Kraus is really going well. We've continued to invest in that. For example, we just launched the Delta-branded sinks online, utilizing the Kraus' offering with the Delta brand. That's real leverage, and that's going well. 
So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing broad-based solid market demand and growth, international, domestic, trade, retail, e-commerce, we're really hitting on all cylinders."

And so if you think about 2019, our e-commerce sales as a percent of our total sales were roughly 5%. And in 2020, that grew nicely. It's now -- we finished 2020 at about 9%. 
And if you break that down by segment, our plumbing product sales were roughly 12% on the e-commerce platform or channel. And as you might expect, and you kind of alluded to in your question, a little bit lower than that in the decorative architectural segment, about 4% because of all the things you cited. Color selection is a challenge for people still to order paint online. So we do have -- I would say that the Behr team has done a nice job of investing in shipping and distribution and fulfillment. And so that's not going to be a limiter to our ability to transact online. It's more of the consumer choosing to select the color online than anything else. 
And as we look forward, we think we're well positioned to continue to grow our e-commerce presence. Because if you consider plumbing products, they're packaged perfectly to ship onesies, twosies to consumers as they -- or their faucets or showerheads online. And so we think we're in a great position to do that. The folks on at Delta have done a great job of adding the capability of the Jackson distribution centers, they fulfill online. So we feel really good about how we were set to serve plumbing growth going forward. 
And to the extent that the paint continues to become more [ sought ] online, we're well positioned to continue to fulfill there as well. So we really like how we're set up as this trend continues to grow here in North America."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.  We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This resulted in our fourth consecu",1129,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.  
We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth. I'm extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth.  
For the quarter, sales increased 24%. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased 18%. Operating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to strong volume leverage. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 34%.  
Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the professional.  
Turning to our plumbing segment. Sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business. International plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency as Hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets. Strong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets.  
New product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR One collection in the second half of the year. This collection was designed by Barber Osgerby, an award-winning internationally acclaimed London-based industrial design studio. This continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality.  
North American plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double-digit growth at Delta.  
Delta Faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels and particular strength in the professionally oriented trade channel. We continue to invest in new products in North American plumbing as well. And 2 days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd Wright by Brizo that furthers the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.  
Lastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steamist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta. Steamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.  
In our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against a healthy 8% comp for the second quarter of 2020. While bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and pro paint grew in the quarter, demand moderated for DIY paint.  
Material availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter. Because of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter.  
Due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales, and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low single digits for the full year. However, with the acceleration we saw in our pro paint business in the quarter, we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low double-digit growth from high single digit for the full year for our pro paint business.  
For the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year.  
With respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high-end line of paint in the third quarter at The Home Depot called BEHR DYNASTY for both DIY and pro painters. DYNASTY is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff-resistant, one-coat hide paint ever. It's low VOC, GREENGUARD and LEED-certified, fast-drying and has an antimicrobial mildew-resistant paint finish. This is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional.  
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million. As part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million. This is approximately 5% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year.  
Underscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately $1 billion.  
Finally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update of what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness. We continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging.  
Inbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter. We now expect our all-in cost inflation to be in the high single-digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low double-digit inflation in the second half of the year. Inflation in coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later in the fourth quarter.  
To mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations. We are also working with our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs.  
Despite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end. While cost inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business. Our teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers.  
However, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products in the channels that we serve. We anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over this time.  
The demand for our products remained strong, and with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional detail on our second quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.  
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs. As a result, sales increased 24% with currency and net acquisitions each contributing 3% to growth.  
In local currency, North American sales increased 15% or 12% excluding acquisitions. Strong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas led this outstanding performance.  
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 50% or 49% excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Gross margin was 36.3% in the quarter, up 50 basis points as we leveraged the strong volume growth.  
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage.  
During the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing and travel and entertainment increased as planned. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters as these costs normalize.  
We delivered strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, up $94 million or 27% from last year, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20.1%.  
Our EPS was $1.14 in the quarter, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to volume leverage, lower interest expense and lower share count.  
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth accelerated in the quarter, with sales up 53%. Currency contributed 5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed another 4%.  
North American sales increased 47% in local currency or 41% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth. With its strong brand recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.  
Watkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong.  
International plumbing sales increased 50% in local currency or 49% excluding the acquisitions and divestitures. Hansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and numerous other countries. Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, U.K. and France, all grew strong double digits in the quarter.  
Segment operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of $274 million, up $115 million or 72%. This strong performance was driven by incremental volume and favorable mix and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing and growth initiatives.  
During the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of HÜPPE, a small shower enclosure business based in Germany. HÜPPE sales were approximately EUR 70 million in 2020. This transaction closed on May 31 and net proceeds were not material.  
Given our second quarter results and current demand trends, we now expect plumbing segment sales growth for 2021 to be in the 22% to 24% range, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%. 
Finally, due to our improved sales outlook, we are increasing our full year margin expectations to approximately 18.5%, up from our previous guide of approximately 18%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative architectural declined 5% for the second quarter or 6% excluding the benefit from acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined double digits in the quarter against a healthy high teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in the first quarter continue to face production challenges. We expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter and now anticipate our DIY paint business to be down low single digits for the full year. 
To help mitigate these challenges, we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources for materials to meet the demand of our customers, which remains strong. I want to thank our supply chain teams, which have done an outstanding job managing through these challenges. 
Our pro paint business delivered strong double-digits growth in the quarter as consumers are increasingly willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong and now anticipate low double-digit growth for the pro paint business for the full year, up from our previous expectation of high single digits as pro paint contractors' order books continue to grow. 
Our builders' hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter as they continue to capitalize on increased consumer demand. 
Segment operating margins were 22.1% and operating profit in the quarter was $188 million due to lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity initiatives. 
For full year 2021, we now expect decorative architectural segment's sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%, down from 4% to 9% due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales and persistent raw material constraints. 
We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19% as productivity initiatives and pricing help offset higher input costs. 
And turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. 
Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over prior year. 
As we discussed last quarter, we had terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified -- defined benefit plans in the second quarter and had an approximate $100 million final cash contribution to the plans to complete this activity. This removes approximately $140 million of pension liabilities from our balance sheet and will benefit our free cash flow by approximately $50 million to reduce cash contributions starting in 2022. 
Also, we received approximately $166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business. 
Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, as of today, we repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750 million. We expect to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the remainder of this year. 
Collectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders. 
Turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. Based on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14%, with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from 17%. 
Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 EPS estimate range of $3.65 to $3.75, represents 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the full year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 in our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Our products are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals. 
Additionally, our markets remain strong, and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in 2022. 
The fundamentals of our repair and remodel business are strong, with year-over-year home price appreciation of over 15% in May and existing home sales up over 23%. Both metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis. And the consumer is strong with nearly $2 trillion in savings and an increased desire to invest in their homes.

The impact of the storms in Texas in the Gulf Coast region continue to limit resin supply. But really, this is an industry-wide phenomenon. And nearly all of our resins, as I mentioned, where suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration in the second quarter. There was a plant explosion, in addition, at a supplier that supplies our [ alkyd resin ], really for the industry, but that affected us.

Given our guide, it does imply a little bit of a step down in margin in the back half of the year. We're pleased with how we've executed so far. 
But as we mentioned on previous calls, we do need to put some money back into the business in the form of investments. And they'll take the form of travel and entertainment, as I mentioned, but they also take the form of some growth initiatives. 
And you may recall in some of our prior calls, we said that we thought in 2020 that we may have delayed as much as $40 million of investment spend, just to make sure we appropriately contain costs as we were going through the pandemic. And so as we see things begin to improve here significantly, we continue to expect that some of that spend will return. And as I mentioned in my remarks, some of that spend actually started to return in the second quarter as we began to make some investments in marketing and growth initiatives. 
So we believe that a lot of that spend will start to come back in the second half of the year. And that will take additional investment in our leading brands. Some of the innovation that Keith mentioned in his prepared remarks in service to ensure that our customers are in full supply of our products. 
And so we think that, that will also contribute to future growth of the business to better meet our customers' needs. At the same time, as we kind of alluded to in our prepared remarks, there's going to be a little bit of a price/cost headwind as we go into the back half of the year. We've always talked about a little bit of a lag in getting price and cost flowing through our P&L. And generally, in the plumbing segment, it's about a 2-quarter lag. And so that's the second piece that will impact the margins in the back half of the year. 
So those 2, a little bit of an incremental spend and then also that price/cost lag. That said, we are very confident that we'll be price/cost neutral as we exit the year."

In terms of channel shift, we pride ourselves on having broad distribution across multiple channels. When you look at our -- you're talking coatings now, but if we look at plumbing, we have very strong position in retail, which is both a pro and a consumer channel. We have a leading position in trade, which is principally more oriented towards the pro. And then in e-commerce, which is mainly consumer, we have a leading position there. 
Similar story when we look at coatings, where we have a strong pro franchise as well as we always talk about, the strong DIY. 
So we like our positioning of where we are in terms of broad channel distribution. So that if there are particular shifts, be it pro to DIY, or online to trade, et cetera, we have it covered. And I think that's a good, significant reason why we're able to perform in this dynamic environment. 
In addition to our strong teams that have been able to address these issues, we're where our customer wants to buy, and we're quite agnostic to these kind of shifts if they happen."

People are more comfortable with pros coming into their home for a longer time. So it's -- we're in the throes of the pandemic, maybe you'd let an appliance repair person in for a quick repair, but you certainly wouldn't want someone in for a major remodel. That's changing. 
And that principally, not totally, but principally flows through our trade channel. So we're seeing a nice pickup in the trade channel. 
Having said that, the dynamic of more and more pros buying in retail is very real. Certainly seeing good foot traffic in retail. And our e-commerce business continues to do very well. And our acquisition, as John spoke about, of Kraus is really going well. We've continued to invest in that. For example, we just launched the Delta-branded sinks online, utilizing the Kraus' offering with the Delta brand. That's real leverage, and that's going well. 
So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing broad-based solid market demand and growth, international, domestic, trade, retail, e-commerce, we're really hitting on all cylinders."

I appreciate that. Maybe just for the second question to take a step back. I was hoping maybe you could just give us a sense of the e-commerce as a possibly even as a percent of revenue across your 2 different segments. 
Obviously, it lends itself a lot more to the plumbing side, decorative, and in particular, paint, a heavier product, maybe more difficult to ship. But maybe just give us a state of where you are in both segments and where you think you might be able to take the business over the next 2 or 3 years?"

And you're right, e-commerce has been a good growth vehicle for us over the course of the last several years. And actually, it's grown quite significantly. 
And so if you think about 2019, our e-commerce sales as a percent of our total sales were roughly 5%. And in 2020, that grew nicely. It's now -- we finished 2020 at about 9%. 
And if you break that down by segment, our plumbing product sales were roughly 12% on the e-commerce platform or channel. And as you might expect, and you kind of alluded to in your question, a little bit lower than that in the decorative architectural segment, about 4% because of all the things you cited. Color selection is a challenge for people still to order paint online. So we do have -- I would say that the Behr team has done a nice job of investing in shipping and distribution and fulfillment. And so that's not going to be a limiter to our ability to transact online. It's more of the consumer choosing to select the color online than anything else. 
And as we look forward, we think we're well positioned to continue to grow our e-commerce presence. Because if you consider plumbing products, they're packaged perfectly to ship onesies, twosies to consumers as they -- or their faucets or showerheads online. And so we think we're in a great position to do that. The folks on at Delta have done a great job of adding the capability of the Jackson distribution centers, they fulfill online. So we feel really good about how we were set to serve plumbing growth going forward. 
And to the extent that the paint continues to become more [ sought ] online, we're well positioned to continue to fulfill there as well. So we really like how we're set up as this trend continues to grow here in North America."

I'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times. In the third quarter, sales increased 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth. This was against a strong 16% comp from last year. This growth came as we continued to face significant supply chain challenges. Certain raw materials were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets. Freight congestion in ports and lack of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages continue to be a challenge. I would like to thank both our employees and our tremendous supplier partners who together have worked tirelessly to address these challenges. They have kept our plants running and our customers supplied, resulting in outstanding top line performance. 
Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products. 
Moving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing. Sales increased 15%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business. These results highlight the strength of our Plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels. To support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia. This additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen Hansgrohe's capabilities to service customers. We plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project over the next 3 years. 
In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter of 2020. 
Pro Paint had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in DIY paint. 
DIY paint declined mid-single digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of 2020. We continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent throughout the quarter. 
When compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals. 
Lastly, Behr paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department. This recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot stock during the DIY surge last year. Our continued investment in our joint effort to grow the Pro Paint category and our commitment to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched BEHR DYNASTY to Home Depot. Each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr paint and The Home Depot and this recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership. 
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million. 
In addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter. bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year. 
Now let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation. The second half of 2021 is largely unfolding as anticipated. We experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter, and we expect mid-teens inflation in the fourth quarter. We have taken pricing actions across both segments and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end. It has been an extremely dynamic year. and our supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges. 
Because of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full year earnings per share in the range of $3.57 to $3.73. 
Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, we are pleased to share with you that our comprehensive 2020 corporate sustainability report is now available on our website. This report demonstrates our commitment to environmental, social and governance responsibility. 
During a year of unparalleled change, our team members remain committed to maintaining our strong reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I efforts. I'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense of inclusion, belonging and support. Our progress in ESG is a priority for our Board, and our executive leadership team. I hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional details on our third quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. 
Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our industry-leading brands remain strong, and our teams executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. This resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top line growth. Sales increased 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year. 
Net acquisitions contributed 2% to growth, and currency had a minimal impact. In local currency, North American sales increased 9% from 6%, excluding acquisitions. This strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in propane, process, showers and spas and by increased selling prices. 
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the 9% comp. Gross margin of 34.2% was impacted by higher commodity and logistics costs in the quarter. We expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. We will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives and expect to exit this year price cost neutral. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%. As planned, during the quarter, we increased certain expenses such as headcount, advertising and marketing, to a more normalized level to support our brands. We expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter as these costs continue to normalize. 
Operating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%. Our EPS was $0.99. 
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth continued to be strong, with sales up 16% against the 13% comp in the third quarter of last year. Net acquisitions contributed 2% to this growth and currency contributed another 1%. North American sales increased 16% or 10% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength in their e-commerce and trade channels. 
With strong brand recognition and [indiscernible] licenships, [indiscernible] continues to drive consumer demand for its products. 
Watkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong. International plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions. Hansgrohe delivered strong growth as demand continued to improve across Europe in numerous other countries. 
Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the U.K. all grew double digits in the quarter. Segment operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million, and operating margin was 18.7%. Operating profit was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier as well as an unfavorable price/cost relationship. This was partially offset by strong incremental volume. We anticipate additional SG&A increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the fourth quarter. we will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity actions and expect to be price cost neutral as we enter 2022. 
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be 22% to 24% with operating margins of approximately 18.5%. 
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural sales increased 4% for the third quarter and 3% excluding acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined mid-single digits in the quarter, against a more than 25% comp in the third quarter of last year. Despite this decline, DIY paint demand appears to be stabilizing as we have seen relatively consistent demand since July. 
When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter DIY sales are up over 20%. Our Propane business delivered exceptional growth of more than 45% in the quarter as paint contractors are applying top-rated bare paint to more commercial and residential projects. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong as propane contractors report growing demand for their services. When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter Pro sales are up over 35%. Segment operating margin in the third quarter was 19% and operating profit was $166 million. Operating profit was impacted by lower volume, increased commodity costs and higher marketing expense to support the new Behr DYNASTY product launch, partially offset by higher net selling prices. 
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Decorative Architectural sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5% and operating margin to be approximately 19%. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. 
Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions,of 17%. 
Finally, we repurchased more than 15.2 million shares in 2021 for $878 million. This is approximately 6% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year. We expect to deploy approximately $150 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the fourth quarter as we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders. 
And turning to our full year guidance. We have summary to our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We continue to anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16% and an operating margin of approximately 17.5%. 
Lastly, we are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate midpoint but narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.73, representing approximately 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

I think there are a few things that really contributed to that 45% growth that we saw in the quarter in Pro. First and foremost, we had really outstanding supply chain execution. I can't say enough about our supply chain teams, our research and development teams that were able to move formulations and our suppliers. We've been working with this supply base and have been pretty consistent in our supply register for like 20 years. So those relationships really paid off in our hard work and supply chain and R&D. So really good availability of product and supply chain execution in general. We continue to invest in our brands. We've talked about that and we've talked about that last quarter, and we continue to invest in our brands. And having that leading brand, having the leading quality, having the leading service levels, all contribute, especially in tough and dicey times like we've just gone through. And we continue to execute in terms of new product introductions and our innovation pipeline such as Behr DYNASTY, a new line of aerosol paints interior stains, Cox and other adjacencies. 
So our ability to not only have that supply chain execution, but continue with the basics of the business of investing in the brands and executing new product introductions all paid off. And I think all those things are helping to drive demand. And we saw that in our performance in the 45% growth that we saw in pro, and we think that's enabled us to get new customers. And now it's up to us to develop the loyalty, which we've demonstrated an ability to do. So it was a very challenging quarter for us across bank, both Pro and DIY, but I'm very happy with the execution."

So the good news is, even though we've experienced some of that, we have also, as a result of pass-through some of the price increase down because of the raw material inflation, but because of some of the logistics inflation that we've experienced.

But as Keith mentioned, the team have done a terrific job of working to offset those costs here as we exit 2021."

With regards to channel and slicing, it is up by channel, very strong performance in e-commerce. We've invested our best and brightest talent there. We've invested our capital in terms of acquisitions to build, and we've been working for a number of years in terms of our internal capabilities from logistics to pick and pack quantities of one to handling returns, marketing and generating more efficient search, a better purchase journey for the consumers, et cetera. So a lot of work has gone into that, but we saw real strong growth, particularly in Plumbing and e-commerce and also in the trade channel. And then strong -- as we mentioned, strong pro growth in paint. So a really good performance across multiple channels and multiple geographies. And I think Susan, that speaks to the work we've done in terms of the portfolio of driving affordable, smaller ticket items that are involved in quicker remodels, if you will, and smaller jobs as well as obviously being part of that bigger ticket job when executed. So that diversity across geographies, channels, price points, et cetera, has really delivered for us a nice robust portfolio, and I think that's a big part of it."

One of the things we specifically have done is with the help of Kraus, we've launched Delta branded Sync online utilizing their offering.

It's just -- it's mind boggling when you think about the types of formulations that we had to go through in our R&D department in terms of changes and revalidations to be able to move from one supplier to an x, be it on colorant or resins and really, that's across our entire business, but specifically in paint. I think when you look at our formulations and how -- what goes into our formulations and what was particularly tight in terms of capacity, I think that gave us a little bit of advantage. And it has not been easy. We have changes the challenges, and we continue to have challenges. But fundamentally, I do think it has to do with the extreme focus and dedication we have on a specific customer or the consumers and the ability to manage that versus, say, having a more complex lineup where we have different types of coatings and different types of customers and those sorts of things. So it's an attribute to simplification, 80/20 focus on our teams and absolutely the highest quality workforce, particularly in supply chain and R&D."

But other than that, if you factor out these large markets, but if you're broadly across the 140 markets that Hansgrohe sells into, nearly all experienced some form of growth.

In the third quarter, sales increased 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growt",790,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times. In the third quarter, sales increased 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth. This was against a strong 16% comp from last year. This growth came as we continued to face significant supply chain challenges. Certain raw materials were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets. Freight congestion in ports and lack of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages continue to be a challenge. I would like to thank both our employees and our tremendous supplier partners who together have worked tirelessly to address these challenges. They have kept our plants running and our customers supplied, resulting in outstanding top line performance.  
Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products.  
Moving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing. Sales increased 15%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business. These results highlight the strength of our Plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels. To support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia. This additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen Hansgrohe's capabilities to service customers. We plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project over the next 3 years.  
In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter of 2020.  
Pro paint had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in DIY paint.  
DIY paint declined mid-single digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of 2020. We continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent throughout the quarter.  
When compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals.  
Lastly, Behr paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department. This recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot in stock during the DIY surge last year. Our continued investment and our joint effort to grow the pro paint category and our commitment to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched BEHR Dynasty to Home Depot. Each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr paint and The Home Depot and this recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership.  
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million. In addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year.  
Now let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation. The second half of 2021 is largely unfolding as anticipated. We experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter, and we expect mid-teens inflation in the fourth quarter. We have taken pricing actions across both segments and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end. It has been an extremely dynamic year. And our supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges.  
Because of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full year earnings per share in the range of $3.67 to $3.73.  
Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, we are pleased to share with you that our comprehensive 2020 corporate sustainability report is now available on our website. This report demonstrates our commitment to environmental, social and governance responsibility.  
During a year of unparalleled change, our team members remain committed to maintaining our strong reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I efforts. I'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense of inclusion, belonging and support. Our progress in ESG is a priority for our Board, and our executive leadership team. I hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional details on our third quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.  
Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our industry-leading brands remain strong, and our teams executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. This resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top line growth. Sales increased 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year.  
Net acquisitions contributed 2% to growth, and currency had a minimal impact. In local currency, North American sales increased 9% from 6%, excluding acquisitions. This strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in pro paint, faucets, showers and spas and by increased selling prices.  
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the healthy 9% comp. Gross margin of 34.2% was impacted by higher commodity and logistics costs in the quarter. We expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. We will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives and expect to exit this year price cost neutral.  
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%. As planned, during the quarter, we increased certain expenses such as headcount, advertising and marketing, to a more normalized level to support our brands. We expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter as these costs continue to normalize.  
Operating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%. Our EPS was $0.99.   
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth continued to be strong, with sales up 16% against the 13% comp in the third quarter of last year. Net acquisitions contributed 2% to this growth and currency contributed another 1%. North American sales increased 16% or 10% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength in their e-commerce and trade channels. With strong brand recognition and [ channel ] relationships, Delta continues to drive consumer demand for its products.  
Watkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong. International plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions. Hansgrohe delivered strong growth as demand continued to improve across Europe in numerous other countries.  
Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the U.K. all grew double digits in the quarter. Segment operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million, and operating margin was 18.7%. Operating profit was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier as well as an unfavorable price/cost relationship. This was partially offset by strong incremental volume. We anticipate additional SG&A increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the fourth quarter. we will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity actions and expect to be price cost neutral as we enter 2022.  
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be 22% to 24% with operating margins of approximately 18.5%.  
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural sales increased 4% for the third quarter and 3% excluding acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined mid-single digits in the quarter, against a more than 25% comp in the third quarter of last year. Despite this decline, DIY paint demand appears to be stabilizing as we have seen relatively consistent demand since July.  
When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter DIY sales are up over 20%. Our Propane business delivered exceptional growth of more than 45% in the quarter as paint contractors are applying top-rated Behr paint to more commercial and residential projects. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong as propane contractors report growing demand for their services. When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter Pro sales are up over 35%. Segment operating margin in the third quarter was 19% and operating profit was $166 million. Operating profit was impacted by lower volume, increased commodity costs and higher marketing expense to support the new BEHR DYNASTY product launch, partially offset by higher net selling prices.  
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Decorative Architectural sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5% and operating margin to be approximately 19%.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions of 17%.  
Finally, we repurchased more than 15.2 million shares in 2021 for $878 million. This is approximately 6% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year. We expect to deploy approximately $150 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the fourth quarter as we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders.  
And turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We continue to anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16% and an operating margin of approximately 17.5%.  
Lastly, we are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate midpoint but narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.73, representing approximately 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck.  
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

Or conversely, should we be aware of any more transitory benefits perhaps as customers are sort of hustling to find paints where they can, and you guys have done a great job of keeping BEHR PRO in stock. How should we think about that balance?"

I think there are a few things that really contributed to that 45% growth that we saw in the quarter in pro. First and foremost, we had really outstanding supply chain execution. I can't say enough about our supply chain teams, our research and development teams that were able to move formulations and our suppliers. We've been working with this supply base and have been pretty consistent in our supply register for like 20 years. So those relationships really paid off in our hard work and supply chain and R&D. So really good availability of product and supply chain execution in general. 
We continue to invest in our brands. We've talked about that and we've talked about that last quarter, and we continue to invest in our brands. And having that leading brand, having the leading quality, having the leading service levels, all contribute, especially in tough and dicey times like we've just gone through. And we continue to execute in terms of new product introductions and our innovation pipeline such as BEHR DYNASTY, a new line of aerosol paints, interior stains, [ Cox ] and other adjacencies.  
So our ability to not only have that supply chain execution, but continue with the basics of the business of investing in the brands and executing new product introductions all paid off. And I think all those things are helping to drive demand. And we saw that in our performance in the 45% growth that we saw in pro, and we think that's enabled us to get new customers. And now it's up to us to develop the loyalty, which we've demonstrated an ability to do. So it was a very challenging quarter for us across paint, both pro and DIY, but I'm happy with the execution."

So the good news is, even though we've experienced some of that, we have also, as a result of pass-through some of the price increase down because of the raw material inflation, but because of some of the logistics inflation that we've experienced. And so that is -- we feel good about our ability to get that price, and that's a portion of which allows us to feel good about being price cost neutral as we exit here in 2021."

And then again, same sort of story across both segments and logistics, container costs continue to escalate.

It makes us -- it helps us be able to do the sorts of things that we need to do and react quickly when times get tough.

But fundamentally, I do think it has to do with the extreme focus and dedication we have on a specific customer or the consumers and the ability to manage that versus, say, having a more complex lineup where we have different types of coatings and different types of customers and those sorts of things. So it's an attribute to simplification, 80/20 focus on our teams and absolutely the highest quality workforce, particularly in supply chain and R&D."

But in terms of labor, that continues to be a challenge as we talked about. And that's one of the things that we're working very hard to do as it relates to programs, whether it's white collar or blue collar as it relates to safety in our factories and programs for different work engagements, if you will, or different work methodologies as it relates to work from home or hybrid or coming to the office sort of thing to appeal to as much of the labor as we can. And that includes, in some cases, some wage increase and wage inflation. So yes, labor is an issue. And I think that's globally across industry, but we're also seeing that."

So we did 4 -- of the 4, each of them are very aligned with the strategy of one of our business units. So in the case of Kraus, Delta is looking to grow their e-commerce strategy and Kraus is a great complement to Delta's already strong presence in the e-commerce channel, and it's going to enhance that. 
Similarly, in -- we bought Steamist, one of the leading steam shower businesses that focuses on Delta's strength that the trade -- their trade business with that -- with the steam shower businesses in demand. It's a hand in glove there.  Obviously, the applicator business that we bought earlier in the year, complements Behr's paint offering. And then the dream -- the high-style dream business we bought in Europe complements Hansgrohe's high-style showers and faucets. 
And so if you think about where we're focusing our efforts, it's on the smaller bolt-on tuck-in type businesses that have an alignment with the strategy of one of our business units. And really, that's really focusing on both paint and plumbing. So our team that we've got in place is doing a great job of the cultivation of smaller businesses. I would anticipate there will be future acquisitions. Obviously, we can't foreshadow the timing of those, but teams working hard. Part of the reason that we're focusing on the treatment also is, to your point, the valuations as you move up in terms of the size are quite high. I mean -- and so we see better value in the lower middle market. And so that's where we're focusing our efforts at this time.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times.

I'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times. In the third quarter, sales increased 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth. This was against a strong 16% comp from last year. This growth came as we continued to face significant supply chain challenges. Certain raw materials were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets. Freight congestion in ports and lack of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages continue to be a challenge. I would like to thank both our employees and our tremendous supplier partners who together have worked tirelessly to address these challenges. They have kept our plants running and our customers supplied, resulting in outstanding top line performance.  
Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products.  
Moving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing. Sales increased 15%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business. These results highlight the strength of our Plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels. To support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia. This additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen Hansgrohe's capabilities to service customers. We plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project over the next 3 years.  
In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter of 2020.  
Pro paint had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in DIY paint.  
DIY paint declined mid-single digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of 2020. We continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent throughout the quarter.  
When compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals.  
Lastly, Behr paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department. This recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot in stock during the DIY surge last year. Our continued investment and our joint effort to grow the pro paint category and our commitment to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched BEHR Dynasty to Home Depot. Each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr paint and The Home Depot and this recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership.  
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million. In addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year.  
Now let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation. The second half of 2021 is largely unfolding as anticipated. We experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter, and we expect mid-teens inflation in the fourth quarter. We have taken pricing actions across both segments and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end. It has been an extremely dynamic year. And our supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges.  
Because of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full year earnings per share in the range of $3.67 to $3.73.  
Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, we are pleased to share with you that our comprehensive 2020 corporate sustainability report is now available on our website. This report demonstrates our commitment to environmental, social and governance responsibility.  
During a year of unparalleled change, our team members remain committed to maintaining our strong reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I efforts. I'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense of inclusion, belonging and support. Our progress in ESG is a priority for our Board, and our executive leadership team. I hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional details on our third quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.  Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our industry-leading brands remain st",923,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.  
Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our industry-leading brands remain strong, and our teams executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. This resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top line growth. Sales increased 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year.  
Net acquisitions contributed 2% to growth, and currency had a minimal impact. In local currency, North American sales increased 9% or 6% excluding acquisitions. This strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in pro paint, faucets, showers and spas and by increased selling prices.  
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18% excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the healthy 9% comp. Gross margin of 34.2% was impacted by higher commodity and logistics costs in the quarter. We expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. We will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives and expect to exit this year price cost neutral.  
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%. As planned, during the quarter, we increased certain expenses such as head count, advertising and marketing, to a more normalized level to support our brands. We expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter as these costs continue to normalize.  
Operating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%. Our EPS was $0.99.   
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing does continue to be strong, with sales up 16% against the 13% comp in the third quarter of last year. Net acquisitions contributed 2% to this growth and currency contributed another 1%. North American sales increased 16% or 10% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength in their e-commerce and trade channels. With strong brand recognition and [ channel ] relationships, Delta continues to drive consumer demand for its products.  
Watkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong. International plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions. Hansgrohe delivered strong growth as demand continued to improve across Europe in numerous other countries.  
Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the U.K. all grew double digits in the quarter. Segment operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million, and operating margin was 18.7%. Operating profit was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier as well as an unfavorable price/cost relationship. This was partially offset by strong incremental volume. We anticipate additional SG&A increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the fourth quarter. We will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity actions and expect to be price cost neutral as we enter 2022.  
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be 22% to 24% with operating margins of approximately 18.5%.  
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural sales increased 4% for the third quarter and 3% excluding acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined mid-single digits in the quarter, against a more than 25% comp in the third quarter of last year. Despite this decline, DIY paint demand appears to be stabilizing as we have seen relatively consistent demand since July.  
When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter DIY sales are up over 20%. Our Propane business delivered exceptional growth of more than 45% in the quarter as paint contractors are applying top-rated Behr paint to more commercial and residential projects. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong as propane contractors report growing demand for their services. When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter Pro sales are up over 35%. Segment operating margin in the third quarter was 19% and operating profit was $166 million. Operating profit was impacted by lower volume, increased commodity costs and higher marketing expense to support the new BEHR DYNASTY product launch, partially offset by higher net selling prices.  
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Decorative Architectural sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5% and operating margin to be approximately 19%.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions of 17%.  
Finally, we repurchased more than 15.2 million shares in 2021 for $878 million. This is approximately 6% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year. We expect to deploy approximately $150 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the fourth quarter as we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders.  
And turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We continue to anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16% and an operating margin of approximately 17.5%.  
Lastly, we are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate midpoint but narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.73, representing approximately 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck.  
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

I think there are a few things that really contributed to that 45% growth that we saw in the quarter in pro. First and foremost, we had really outstanding supply chain execution. I can't say enough about our supply chain teams, our research and development teams that were able to move formulations and our suppliers. We've been working with this supply base and have been pretty consistent in our supply register for like 20 years. So those relationships really paid off in our hard work and supply chain and R&D. So really good availability of product and supply chain execution in general. 
We continue to invest in our brands. We've talked about that and we've talked about that last quarter, and we continue to invest in our brands. And having that leading brand, having the leading quality, having the leading service levels, all contribute, especially in tough and dicey times like we've just gone through. And we continue to execute in terms of new product introductions and our innovation pipeline such as BEHR DYNASTY, a new line of aerosol paints, interior stains, [ Cox ] and other adjacencies.  
So our ability to not only have that supply chain execution, but continue with the basics of the business of investing in the brands and executing new product introductions all paid off. And I think all those things are helping to drive demand. And we saw that in our performance in the 45% growth that we saw in pro, and we think that's enabled us to get new customers. And now it's up to us to develop the loyalty, which we've demonstrated an ability to do. So it was a very challenging quarter for us across paint, both pro and DIY, but I'm happy with the execution."

And we see also as a result, seeing delays in getting product through the port systems here in the United States, whether it's on the West Coast or any of the other ports that we bring product in.  
So the good news is, even though we've experienced some of that, we have also, as a result of pass-through some of the price increase down because of the raw material inflation, but because of some of the logistics inflation that we've experienced. And so that is -- we feel good about our ability to get that price, and that's a portion of which allows us to feel good about being price cost neutral as we exit here in 2021."

And then again, same sort of story across both segments and logistics, container costs continue to escalate. Even things like pallets and, of course, over-the-road trucking costs associated with some labor constraints that are broadly there in the trucking industry. So it's broad-based inflation.

And it has not been easy. We have changes to the challenges, and we continue to have challenges.

I said, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got continued good backlogs in a number of our businesses that we've got visibility into. We mentioned the fact that Watkins, our wellness business, continue to have a very strong backlog of probably several hundred million dollars. Our Plumbing businesses, both Hansgrohe and Delta, to the extent that we look at their backlogs, they are bigger than they would historically be at this time of the year, given the seasonality of things generally slowing down. So we do think that the first part of growth going into the first part of '22 will be good, but obviously, we're up against some pretty tough comps. Beyond that, Keith, I don't know, paint is -- we got a little bit less visibility into the backlog of paint other than on the pro business, where we see some of the commercial projects coming through."

The 2 big ones that we watch because it really does impact our low-ticket repair/remodel portfolio of products that we have, our existing home turnover and home price appreciation. As you know, those 2 have been very good. And you layer those 2 on to the fact that the consumer's balance sheet is very good. All statistics say that there's $2 trillion of more savings as a result of the pandemic that the consumers are sitting on now. And the fact that the home is for the vast majority of consumers, it's their largest investment. We think this environment bodes well for continued investment in homes. We're hearing about backlogs of big-ticket projects with contractors.

So we did 4 -- of the 4, each of them are very aligned with the strategy of one of our business units. So in the case of Kraus, Delta is looking to grow their e-commerce strategy and Kraus is a great complement to Delta's already strong presence in the e-commerce channel, and it's going to enhance that. 
Similarly, in -- we bought Steamist, one of the leading steam shower businesses is that focuses on Delta's strength that the trade -- their trade business with that -- with the steam shower business is of demand. It fits hand in glove there.  Obviously, the applicator business that we bought earlier in the year, complements Behr's paint offering. And then the drain -- the high-style drain business we bought in Europe complements Hansgrohe's high-style showers and faucets. 
And so if you think about where we're focusing our efforts, it's on the smaller bolt-on tuck-in type businesses that have an alignment with the strategy of one of our business units. And really, that's really focusing on both paint and plumbing. So our team that we've got in place is doing a great job of the cultivation of smaller businesses. I would anticipate there will be future acquisitions. Obviously, we can't foreshadow the timing of those, but team's working hard. Part of the reason that we're focusing on the treatment also is, to your point, the valuations as you move up in terms of the size are quite high. I mean -- and so we see better value in the lower middle market. And so that's where we're focusing our efforts at this time.

I'm proud of the way our team continues to execute in these dynamic times. In the third quarter, sales increased 11%, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth. This was against a strong 16% comp from last year. This growth came as we continued to face significant supply chain challenges. Certain raw materials were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets. Freight congestion in ports and lack of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages continue to be a challenge. I would like to thank both our employees and our tremendous supplier partners who together have worked tirelessly to address these challenges. They have kept our plants running and our customers supplied, resulting in outstanding top line performance.  
Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products.  
Moving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing. Sales increased 15%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business. These results highlight the strength of our Plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels. To support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Serbia. This additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen Hansgrohe's capabilities to service customers. We plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project over the next 3 years.  
In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter of 2020.  
Pro paint had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in DIY paint.  
DIY paint declined mid-single digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of 2020. We continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent throughout the quarter.  
When compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals.  
Lastly, Behr paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department. This recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot in stock during the DIY surge last year. Our continued investment and our joint effort to grow the pro paint category and our commitment to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched BEHR Dynasty to Home Depot. Each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr paint and The Home Depot and this recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership.  
Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million. In addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year.  
Now let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation. The second half of 2021 is largely unfolding as anticipated. We experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter, and we expect mid-teens inflation in the fourth quarter. We have taken pricing actions across both segments and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end. It has been an extremely dynamic year. And our supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges.  
Because of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full year earnings per share in the range of $3.67 to $3.73.  
Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, we are pleased to share with you that our comprehensive 2020 corporate sustainability report is now available on our website. This report demonstrates our commitment to environmental, social and governance responsibility.  
During a year of unparalleled change, our team members remain committed to maintaining our strong reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I efforts. I'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense of inclusion, belonging and support. Our progress in ESG is a priority for our Board, and our executive leadership team. I hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional details on our third quarter results. John?"

As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.  
Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our industry-leading brands remain strong, and our teams executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. This resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top line growth. Sales increased 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year.  
Net acquisitions contributed 2% to growth, and currency had a minimal impact. In local currency, North American sales increased 9% or 6% excluding acquisitions. This strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in pro paint, faucets, showers and spas and by increased selling prices.  
In local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18% excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the healthy 9% comp. Gross margin of 34.2% was impacted by higher commodity and logistics costs in the quarter. We expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. We will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives and expect to exit this year price cost neutral.  
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%. As planned, during the quarter, we increased certain expenses such as head count, advertising and marketing, to a more normalized level to support our brands. We expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter as these costs continue to normalize.  
Operating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%. Our EPS was $0.99.   
Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing does continue to be strong, with sales up 16% against the 13% comp in the third quarter of last year. Net acquisitions contributed 2% to this growth and currency contributed another 1%. North American sales increased 16% or 10% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength in their e-commerce and trade channels. With strong brand recognition and [ channel ] relationships, Delta continues to drive consumer demand for its products.  
Watkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains strong. International plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions. Hansgrohe delivered strong growth as demand continued to improve across Europe in numerous other countries.  
Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the U.K. all grew double digits in the quarter. Segment operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million, and operating margin was 18.7%. Operating profit was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier as well as an unfavorable price/cost relationship. This was partially offset by strong incremental volume. We anticipate additional SG&A increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the fourth quarter. We will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity actions and expect to be price cost neutral as we enter 2022.  
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be 22% to 24% with operating margins of approximately 18.5%.  
Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural sales increased 4% for the third quarter and 3% excluding acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined mid-single digits in the quarter, against a more than 25% comp in the third quarter of last year. Despite this decline, DIY paint demand appears to be stabilizing as we have seen relatively consistent demand since July.  
When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter DIY sales are up over 20%. Our Propane business delivered exceptional growth of more than 45% in the quarter as paint contractors are applying top-rated Behr paint to more commercial and residential projects. We expect demand in this channel to remain strong as propane contractors report growing demand for their services. When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter Pro sales are up over 35%. Segment operating margin in the third quarter was 19% and operating profit was $166 million. Operating profit was impacted by lower volume, increased commodity costs and higher marketing expense to support the new BEHR DYNASTY product launch, partially offset by higher net selling prices.  
For full year 2021, we continue to expect Decorative Architectural sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5% and operating margin to be approximately 19%.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions of 17%.  
Finally, we repurchased more than 15.2 million shares in 2021 for $878 million. This is approximately 6% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year. We expect to deploy approximately $150 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the fourth quarter as we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders.  
And turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We continue to anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16% and an operating margin of approximately 17.5%.  
Lastly, we are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate midpoint but narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.73, representing approximately 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck.  
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith."

I think there are a few things that really contributed to that 45% growth that we saw in the quarter in pro. First and foremost, we had really outstanding supply chain execution. I can't say enough about our supply chain teams, our research and development teams that were able to move formulations and our suppliers. We've been working with this supply base and have been pretty consistent in our supply register for like 20 years. So those relationships really paid off in our hard work and supply chain and R&D. So really good availability of product and supply chain execution in general. 
We continue to invest in our brands. We've talked about that and we've talked about that last quarter, and we continue to invest in our brands. And having that leading brand, having the leading quality, having the leading service levels, all contribute, especially in tough and dicey times like we've just gone through. And we continue to execute in terms of new product introductions and our innovation pipeline such as BEHR DYNASTY, a new line of aerosol paints, interior stains, [ Cox ] and other adjacencies.  
So our ability to not only have that supply chain execution, but continue with the basics of the business of investing in the brands and executing new product introductions all paid off. And I think all those things are helping to drive demand. And we saw that in our performance in the 45% growth that we saw in pro, and we think that's enabled us to get new customers. And now it's up to us to develop the loyalty, which we've demonstrated an ability to do. So it was a very challenging quarter for us across paint, both pro and DIY, but I'm happy with the execution."

So the good news is, even though we've experienced some of that, we have also, as a result of pass-through some of the price increase down because of the raw material inflation, but because of some of the logistics inflation that we've experienced.

As you know, those 2 have been very good. And you layer those 2 on to the fact that the consumer's balance sheet is very good. All statistics say that there's $2 trillion of more savings as a result of the pandemic that the consumers are sitting on now. And the fact that the home is for the vast majority of consumers, it's their largest investment. We think this environment bodes well for continued investment in homes. We're hearing about backlogs of big-ticket projects with contractors. So we think the supply chain tightness that the consumers have experienced have contributed to that backlog of big ticket projects. And so going into '22, we think the environment is set up for good growth."

And this was in plumbing was simplifying our assortment for a limited period of time. It was for a couple of months, I believe, in that range to allow our suppliers to do less changeovers, have longer runs and ultimately do a better job of supplying our customers. So there was a little bit of that, but it was short-lived. It helped out, as I said, our supply base with longer run. But that was basically simplification in 80/20 thinking as part of the Masco operating system, and we applied that in this case, during this tough issue around supply chain. But that's over for the most part, those SKUs are back in line. And that's, again, part of what gives me confidence that we're starting to get some relief on some of these issues as it relates to supply chain, particularly from our great supplier partners."

I think a good way to think about our M&A strategy is take a look at the 4 recent acquisitions we've done in the last year. So we did 4 -- of the 4, each of them are very aligned with the strategy of one of our business units. So in the case of Kraus, Delta is looking to grow their e-commerce strategy and Kraus is a great complement to Delta's already strong presence in the e-commerce channel, and it's going to enhance that. 
Similarly, in -- we bought Steamist, one of the leading steam shower businesses is that focuses on Delta's strength that the trade -- their trade business with that -- with the steam shower business is of demand. It fits hand in glove there.  Obviously, the applicator business that we bought earlier in the year, complements Behr's paint offering. And then the drain -- the high-style drain business we bought in Europe complements Hansgrohe's high-style showers and faucets. 
And so if you think about where we're focusing our efforts, it's on the smaller bolt-on tuck-in type businesses that have an alignment with the strategy of one of our business units. And really, that's really focusing on both paint and plumbing. So our team that we've got in place is doing a great job of the cultivation of smaller businesses. I would anticipate there will be future acquisitions. Obviously, we can't foreshadow the timing of those, but team's working hard. Part of the reason that we're focusing on the treatment also is, to your point, the valuations as you move up in terms of the size are quite high. I mean -- and so we see better value in the lower middle market. And so that's where we're focusing our efforts at this time. And then I think we'll continue to focus on our efforts in that lower middle market over the coming months and quarters."
