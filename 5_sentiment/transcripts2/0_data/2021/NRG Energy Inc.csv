I'm joined this morning by Gaetan Frotte, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. 
I'd like to start this call by expressing our utmost concern for the millions of Texans impacted by Winter Storm Uri. We're actively working in our communities and with our customers to provide support and relief to those in need. I also want to recognize all the men and women from NRG who under frigid conditions, we're working tirelessly to keep our power plants running and those employees who work day and night through this event to inform and support our customers, all while facing their own hardship at home. From everyone at NRG, thank you. 
Let's move on to Slide 3 for the 3 key messages of the call. First, above all else, our top priority and core focus today is helping our Texas communities recover from the devastating winter storm. The system-wide energy failure that occurred in Texas is unacceptable, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to prevent this from happening again. 
Next, our integrated platform continues to deliver stable results through unprecedented events like the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events, further validating the strength of our model. Finally, we continue to advance our customer-centric strategy by redefining our platform to better serve our customers. In January, we closed on the Direct Energy transaction, forming the leading North American integrated energy and home services company, now serving a network of 6 million customers. Today, we are announcing the sale of a 4.8 gigawatt portfolio of noncore fossil assets, which I will detail later in the presentation. 
Turning to Slide 4. Starting on the left-hand side, Winter Storm Uri was simply historic. It was the third coldest 3-day stretch on record in Texas. Blanketing the state for days with record cold temperatures and precipitation, putting unprecedented stress on the entire energy system. This winter storm exceeded all planning parameters and highlighted the interdependency between the natural gas and power systems. 
On adjusted estimated peak low of 77 gigawatts surpassing not just the winter peak, but the all-time peak. And due to weather-related system and plant-specific issues, 52 gigawatts of capacity in the market were forced off-line at one-time or another. Last week, we committed to work with regulators and legislators on a comprehensive and exhaustive root cost analysis of what went wrong in the energy system, from fuel supply, to the production and delivery of electricity. Our goal is to have a system that is more resilient to prevent this from happening again. 
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide. Our work to prepare for winter conditions began well before the onset of frigid temperatures. As part of our Winter Readiness program, we execute a comprehensive winterization program that starts with a lessons learned from prior winter seasons. Then every September, our power plants in each of our markets, including Texas, begin a well-defined process of preparing for winter operations. 
The results are presented to me in early November by the Head of Operations and each plant manager. We then submit our declaration of completion of the winter weatherization preparations to ERCOT and the PUCT by November 30. 
In early February, we recognized the threat of this significant winter stone. Safety of our employees, customers and communities is always our top priority. For our customers, we send cold weather alerts and energy conservation notifications across all of our retail brands and work with our large C&I customers to proactively reduce their load. 
For our generation fleet, we put all plants at the highest level of alert, made all operational units available to the market and secured additional critical supplies at our sites. This included moving personnel from the Northeast with extreme cold weather experience and technical expertise to Texas plants. 
Ahead of the storm, we also took an additional steps of increasing our available generation capacity by bringing back nearly 2 gigawatts of power generation typically reserve only for summer months. We also executed additional natural gas and power hedges. Our available generation portfolio performed at roughly 80% capacity factor on average. When comparing our generation production to a similar period earlier in the month, we produced almost twice as much electricity. Despite our best efforts to winterize the fleet, we suffered our share of unit-specific and system-related problems that will be part of our root cost analysis. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our strategy is to maintain a balanced portfolio between retail load and supply to protect both our customers and our business. In Texas, we have a significant retail footprint across the state, supported by diverse generation assets and third-party agreements. During the storm, we aimed at maximizing the output of our power plants while maintaining a fairly balanced position across the portfolio. 
Importantly, none of our residential customers will be exposed to the real-time wholesale power prices that occurred during the storm. We don't offer these products to our residential customers, and we also don't believe they should be available to them. And like I said earlier, we're focused on recovery efforts across our communities. We have pledged an initial $10 million in relief to our communities, customers and employees. 
Now turning to the right side of the slide. We expect our balance platform to deliver stable results. Our preliminary analysis of the winter storm financial impact is expected to be within our current guidance range. These preliminary assessment incorporates internal estimates on customer meter and settlement data, which have not been finalized yet. 
It also makes assumption on potential customer and counterparty credit risk and ERCOT-default allocations. We have also performed a stress test on our assumptions, resulting in a potential outcome, although at a lower probability of plus/minus $100 million to our guidance ranges. As information becomes available, we'll be able to narrow these kind of outcomes. 
Moving to the 2020 operational and financial highlights on Slide 6. Beginning with our 2020 scorecard, we executed on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results and had our best safety year ever. I want to take a moment to thank and commend all of my colleagues as this is now the third straight year, we set a new record for safety, an incredible accomplishment. Our 3-year transformation plan goals were fully achieved in 2020. During this time, we simplify and streamline our portfolio, achieved a strong balance sheet establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. 
Over the last 5 years, we have been evolving our platform to move closer to the customer. In 2020, we took major steps towards this goal, with key highlights, including the acquisition of Direct Energy, and diversifying our supply strategy through signing renewable PPAs in ERCOT and launching RFPs in the East. We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio by growing retail and reducing generation. I look forward to sharing with you the next chapter during our Spring Analyst Day. 
Now moving to the financial results on the right-hand side of the slide, we delivered $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range and $1.547 billion of free cash flow before growth, which includes the pulling forward of certain items from 2021 into 2020 in order to fund the direct energy acquisition. Gaetan will provide more detail on the free cash flow later in the presentation. 
I want to note that our 2020 carbon emissions came in below our 2025 50% reduction goal. We're not adjusting our 2025 targets today, but this highlights our efforts in reducing carbon emissions. Finally, as I previously stated, we're maintaining our guidance ranges for 2021. 
Turning to Slide 7. I want to provide an update on the direct energy integration. This transaction presented a step change for us as we move closer to the customer by significantly expanding our customer network and home services. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, it also provides a significant opportunity to leverage our operating platform and achieve significant synergies. This transaction advance our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure. 
With Direct Energy close, NRG now has the strongest collection of competitive power brands, offering energy products and services in North America. The Direct Energy acquisition significantly expands our residential and business footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas. Both residential and business customers are able to leverage our platforms for solutions that feed their specific needs, elevating consumer choice to a whole new level. 
Our integration efforts are well underway. And today, we are reaffirming the planned targets. We're already making significant progress on talent assessment, collateral management and systems integration. Throughout this integration process, we are focused on high-grading our organization through retaining the best and diverse talent and further deepening our customer-focused culture. 
The integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan and has a similar governance structure. I am highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergies outlined on the slide. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see a scorecard that looks familiar and that is because it is how we reported our transformation plan progress to all of you. We plan to update this scorecard with our results in order to provide transparency and keep you informed of our progress. 
Next, turning to Slide 8 for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. I highlighted last quarter that we were actively focused on monetizing noncore assets with a target to realize a minimum of $250 million in equity proceeds within 6 to 12 months. I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of Arclight Capital partners, to sell a 4.8 gigawatt portfolio of fossil fuel assets across New York, Connecticut and California for $760 million in cash proceeds or roughly 4x EBITDA. 
As you can see on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, many of these assets are nearing end-of-life and with economics dependent upon capacity markets. Excluding Sunrise, the average expected capacity factors ranges between 0% to 6%. This is a good transaction for us. It further streamlines our business and address terminal value and earnings concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth. 
Our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. The asset sale is targeted to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net cash proceeds after associated debt reduction will be allocated using our capital allocation framework. 
Before turning over the call to Gaetan for the financial review, I want to thank Kirk Andrews for his decade of service at NRG. Over the last 10 years, Kirk has not only been a colleague, but also a trusted friend. And I believe I speak for the entire organization when I say that we all wish him well and the best in his future endeavors. Our finance team is in capable hands with Gaetan Frotte, our Treasurer, stepping in as Interim CFO. With that, I will pass it over to Gaetan for the financial review."

Last year, energy delivered slightly more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. So our adjust",1057,"Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the full year results and our 2021 guidance. Last year, energy delivered slightly more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. So our adjusted EBITDA for the year is in line with our 2020 guidance, and I would note that it includes the impact of COVID-19 that came in at only $25 million or half of our original cost expectations. 
Moving to free cash flow before growth. Year-end results are $47 million higher than our latest midpoint of guidance driven by the inclusion of $43 million in distribution from Agua Caliente in 2020, just prior to the sale of the project in early February. Finally, from a balance sheet standpoint, 2020 was also very successful, with a year-end leverage close to 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which is at the strongest end of our targeted range. 
In addition, we had over $7 billion of liquidity accumulated in anticipation of the acquisition of Direct Energy in early January. A portion of that liquidity proved very useful during the recent winter storm. 
Moving to 2021 guidance as included in the closing announcement for Direct Energy, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and our 2021 free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion. As mentioned by Mauricio before, we are maintaining our guidance range for 2021 based on our preliminary analysis of the impact of the Winter Storm Uri on our results. 
Based on a stress analysis, we believe that the financial impact on the guidance range could vary by plus or minus $100 million, subject to final customer meter and settlement data, counterparty credit risk and expected ERCOT default allocation. Finally, we have signed a PSA to sell 4.8 gigawatt of generation assets in our East West region to an affiliate of Arclight for $760 million, and we anticipate closing to occur by the end of the year. These assets contribute approximately $190 million of adjusted EBITDA and approximately $130 million of free cash flow before growth to energy. I would note that these numbers have not been yet deducted from our guidance range. 
Turning to the sources and uses for Direct Energy on Slide 11, we wanted to provide a bridge between the numbers reported during our last earnings call in early November when we discussed eliminating the need for $750 million of preferred equity, and the actual results after closing the acquisition last January. 
So following from the left, with the $3.745 billion of total sources and uses as discussed last quarter, we first lowered NRG cash by $100 million to reflect the lower cash reserves available at year-end as shown on Slide 22 of the appendix. This was offset with an equivalent temporary growth under the revolver at closing. 
Next, we use $13 million of incremental financing cost savings, minus $2 million of initial discount on our bond issuance to reduce the temporary draw under the revolver by $11 million. In the next column, we reflected $77 million for a purchase price adjustment that was paid to Centrica due in part to the larger cash balance available at Direct energy when we acquired the company. This was also financed through a temporary draw under our revolver. 
Finally, we show the impact from acquired cash and margin collateral since at closing, Direct Energy at $233 million in cash margin posted and $152 million of cash and cash equivalents for a total of $385 million of cash on its -- and equivalents on its balance sheet. This was higher than we had anticipated last quarter, and we were able to use it after closing to repay the $160 million temporary draw under the revolver, and reduce the NRG cash allocated to the acquisition by $219 million. More importantly, it also means more cash is available for deleveraging in 2021, which eliminates the need to use future asset sale proceeds to achieve our investment-grade credit metrics by year-end. 
I will now turn to Slide 12, where we are updating the combined 2021 capital allocation provided last quarter. Please note that changes on this slide are indicated in blue. Starting from the left, we have adjusted the 2021 excess cash to reflect the final $715 million of cash reserve at the end of 2020. The $1.54 billion updated free cash flow before growth, including Direct Energy, based on the midpoint of our guidance range and finally, the $120 million of net proceeds from the sale of our remaining equity stake in Agua Caliente. All this represent a total of $2.375 billion available. 
Then moving on to the next change on the third column. We updated the capital allocated to the direct acquisition, which is now at $496 million, as shown on the previous slide. Finally, given the reduced cash needs for the acquisition, we are allocating our additional excess cash of $219 million to debt reduction. This brings our total debt reduction to nearly $1.2 billion bringing us to within our targeted investment-grade metrics in 2021. And importantly, without the need for asset sale proceeds that we had mentioned before. 
Finally, on Slide 13, I will start on the left with our 2021 credit metrics, which is now based on our finalized plan shown in the middle column. After adjusting our corporate balance for the increased debt reduction from 2021 capital allocation, our 2021 net debt balance is approximately $7 billion, which, based on the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA, implies a pro forma ratio of 2.65x net debt to EBITDA, well within the range of our targeted investment-grade metrics. 
Turning to the right. We also wanted to update you on our strong liquidity position at the end of last week, which at $3.8 billion is ample enough to continue supporting our business even during periods of stress like we experienced over the last 2 weeks. 
In conclusion, and as discussed earlier, after proving the resilient performance of our integrated model during these trying times for Texas and our capital allocation plan to achieve investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2021, we continue to believe in our ability to reach investment-grade ratings by the end of 2001 or early 2022. Back to you, Mauricio."

So I think that process is going to take some time, and the first steps already happened last week. I mean I think everybody has seen the hearings down in Austin. I had the opportunity to participate. And that to me, it is the prudent first step. Having spent some time down there and just looking comprehensively at the and what happened, I will say that there is perhaps 3 themes that legislatures and other stakeholders will be looking at it. 
First is the hardening of the energy system from natural gas to power generation. I think it is clear that when the power generation has made up of close to 50% of the total capacity fueled by natural gas. Natural gas, the natural gas system becomes critical, and it needs to be harder than just as rigorous as the power generation system. The second thing, I think there is going to be a conversation around the market design. And the focus from my perspective should be around the reserve margins and what is the excess capacity that we want to have in the ERCOT system to make sure that this doesn't happen again with perhaps more extreme weather conditions than in the past. And I think part of these excess capacity is not just the quantity of capacity, but also the quality of capacity. And what I mean about the quality, it is fuel diversification. And then I think, finally, it is the communications. And to me, it is clear that communications needed to be a lot more than what we experienced last week. First is the communication between the power and the natural gas systems and the coordination between the 2. Second, it is the communication between PVUs who were responsible of implementing the power outage directed by ERCOT, and the reps who have the relationship with the customer. I mean, I think that communication is to be a lot stronger. And we need to evaluate and assess a -- perhaps an alert system that tells our communities when something like this is going to happen and the potential risk. And then finally, I just -- I think it is important that we recognize just the magnitude of this winter storm. I mean, any way you see it, it was historic and as we are assessing these 3 things, particularly the hardening, we just need to make sure that is that the -- are we rebaselining our winterization efforts with these 100-year winter storm that we all live. So that would be my initial comments, Steve. Obviously, I mean, we're only in the beginning phase of this, but -- and I think we need to -- I think all the parties from what I can gather in my time in Austin, they want to take their time to make sure that they really fully understand what caused it so they can be thorough and have changes that will be effective and long lasting."

I think I said it in the past that generation, the portfolio of generation that we have has to help us better serve our customers. So when you take a step back, obviously, owning physical generation, it is important. But we can get some of the characteristics of physical generation through bilateral agreements. It doesn't -- we don't have to own it all the time or always to be able to have those characteristics. We can actually structure some of those agreements, so we can benefit and utilize these -- the characteristics of physical generation. I will say that the strength that we all saw in the system last week is giving us already lessons learned on how we should be thinking about counterparty performance, counterparty risk. And the team is already looking at the lessons learned on our commercial team which, by the way, I just want to give a big kudos to both commercial operations and plant operations because they absolutely maximize the amount of generation that we were giving to the system and at the same time, maintaining the stability and the balance on our portfolio. So that's how I think about it, Steve. And obviously, our matching of generation and retail is always informed by market conditions. So it's not like set it and forget it."

Your testimony last week indicated that the company had several assets come offline during the storm, like STP Unit 1 for a couple of days. To what extent the concentration of load shedding in Houston help you and sort of free up the generation and sort of the purchase power? Just trying to really understand whether this is a product of really good risk management, some load shedding or a combination of the 2, especially as investors are weighing their thesis in the sector and sort of thinking about these type of events potentially reoccurring again."

We -- as we were approaching the storm, the commercial team took the necessary steps to strengthen our position going into the storm, both on natural gas and power hedges. In addition to that, our plant operations people brought in almost 2,000 megawatts of generation that normally, in most of the circumstances never run in the winter and we actually have a reserve for summer operations. So that's another testament of strengthening our position as we go into the store. And then as you were looking at -- as you look at our load obligations across the state, it's pretty well diversified between Houston and Dallas and the north. So I think it was a good, good solid execution with the right foundation in terms of the integrated portfolio. And the necessary steps to get ready for it. So Chris, is there something more that you want to have?"

Look, if you look at it, our strategy is to have a mix of physical gen and market purchases. And notwithstanding the problems we face, frankly, on both sides, right, with unit outages and then counterparty issues that we're working through. This strategy of diversified supply seems to have held together pretty well. As we saw the forecast get colder and colder, we brought more generation, like Mauricio mentioned, not a seasonal layup, and we bought more power from the market. Like let's be clear, we were prepping to cover loads in the high 60s and low 70s, know what I mean, in terms of thousands of megawatts load. We were also, don't forget, able to use our gas storage and transportation contracts and our ability to find and buy what I will politely described as a seemly expensive gas in order to keep those gas units of ours producing the megawatts that the grid needed. I know that not everybody was able to do that, but the combination of our contracts and working out in the market, we were able to cover it. So that is kind of how the whole thing worked out to where we think we're still within the guidance range, plus or minus $100 million."

I mean the first one is the hardening of the system. And I was very clear, the hardening of the system cannot only happen on the power generation side, it has to happen also on the natural gas system. I mean, when 45% of our total generation capacity in Texas is fueled by natural gas they're completely interdependent. And so that interdependency, it needs to be expanded when we're thinking about the hardening of the system, the winterization of the system the second thing is the communications. Obviously, there needs to be a lot more coordination between natural gas and power. And just like we talk about fuel diversification on power generation, we need to be thinking about redundancy on critical parts of the gas system, like compressor stations. Does it make sense to have backward generation? What are the standards for winterization at the wellhead? I mean there is a number of things that can happen on the side. And that will also -- we need to review the winterization protocols on the power generation side. I mean, the last time there was a recommendation was in 2011. And and the wind -- the storm in 2011, I mean, I have this stat that I think puts things in perspective. The 3-day stretch temperature this winter storm, I think, ranks as the third coldest in the last 130 years. 2011 was the sixth year so I think that should give you a pretty good context in terms of what was the baseline that was used for the winterization of the power generation. And I think there's going to be a conversation about rebaselining that. So some of that is going to happen. And I think it has to be also beyond power generation. It has to be around the customer and the communications with the customer. I mean, when you're talking about power outages and rolling power outages, first, you need to make sure that you communicate with with the customers. The TV use are responsible for implementing these load shares at the direction of ERCOT that is balancing the system. And so do we need to review the protocol in terms of how that is implemented. What is the communication protocol between the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail energy providers that have the relationship with the customer. So all of these things are going to have to be taken into consideration. And I think I have to say, I mean, the text of legislature is really doing the right thing in terms of doing this exhaustive and comprehensive root cost analysis."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning by Gaetan Frotte, our Interim Chief Financial Officer.

I'm joined this morning by Gaetan Frotte, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.  
I'd like to start this call by expressing our utmost concern for the millions of Texans impacted by Winter Storm Uri. We're actively working in our communities and with our customers to provide support and relief to those in need. I also want to recognize all the men and women from NRG who, under frigid conditions, were working tirelessly to keep our power plants running and those employees who work day and night through this event to inform and support our customers, all while facing their own hardship at home. From everyone at NRG, thank you.  
Let's move on to Slide 3 for the 3 key messages of the call. First, above all else, our top priority and core focus today is helping our Texas communities recover from the devastating winter storm. The system-wide energy failure that occurred in Texas is unacceptable, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to prevent this from happening again.  Next, our integrated platform continues to deliver stable results through unprecedented events like the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events, further validating the strength of our model. 
Finally, we continue to advance our customer-centric strategy by redefining our platform to better serve our customers. In January, we closed on the Direct Energy transaction, forming the leading North American integrated energy and home services company, now serving a network of 6 million customers. Today, we are announcing the sale of a 4.8 gigawatt portfolio of noncore fossil assets, which I will detail later in the presentation.  
Turning to Slide 4. Starting on the left-hand side, Winter Storm Uri was simply historic. It was the third coldest 3-day stretch on record in Texas, blanketing the state for days with record cold temperatures and precipitation, putting unprecedented stress on the entire energy system. 
This winter storm exceeded all planning parameters and highlighted the interdependency between the natural gas and power systems.  On adjusted estimated peak low of 77 gigawatts surpassing not just the winter peak, but the all-time peak. And due to weather-related system and plant-specific issues, 52 gigawatts of capacity in the market were forced off-line at one time or another. 
Last week, we committed to work with regulators and legislators on a comprehensive and exhaustive root cost analysis of what went wrong in the energy system, from fuel supply to the production and delivery of electricity. Our goal is to have a system that is more resilient to prevent this from happening again.  
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide. Our work to prepare for winter conditions began well before the onset of frigid temperatures. As part of our winter readiness program, we execute a comprehensive winterization program that starts with the lessons learned from prior winter seasons. Then every September, our power plants in each of our markets, including Texas, begin a well-defined process of preparing for winter operations.  The results are presented to me in early November by the Head of Operations and each plant manager. We then submit our declaration of completion of the winter weatherization preparations to ERCOT and the PUCT by November 30.  
In early February, we recognized the threat of this significant winter storm. Safety of our employees, customers and communities is always our top priority. For our customers, we send cold weather alerts and energy conservation notifications across all of our retail brands and work with our large C&I customers to proactively reduce their load.  For our generation fleet, we put all plants at the highest level of alert, made all operational units available to the market and secured additional critical supplies at our sites. This included moving personnel from the Northeast with extreme cold weather experience and technical expertise to Texas plants.  
Ahead of the storm, we also took an additional steps of increasing our available generation capacity by bringing back nearly 2 gigawatts of power generation typically reserve only for summer months. We also executed additional natural gas and power hedges. Our available generation portfolio performed at roughly 80% capacity factor on average. When comparing our generation production to a similar period earlier in the month, we produced almost twice as much electricity.  Despite our best efforts to winterize the fleet, we suffered our share of unit-specific and system-related problems that will be part of our root cost analysis.  
Turning to Slide 5. Our strategy is to maintain a balanced portfolio between retail load and supply to protect both our customers and our business. In Texas, we have a significant retail footprint across the state, supported by diverse generation assets and third-party agreements. 
During the storm, we aimed at maximizing the output of our power plants while maintaining a fairly balanced position across the portfolio.  Importantly, none of our residential customers will be exposed to the real-time wholesale power prices that occurred during the storm. We don't offer these products to our residential customers, and we also don't believe they should be available to them. And like I said earlier, we're focused on recovery efforts across our communities. We have pledged an initial $10 million in relief to our communities, customers and employees.  
Now turning to the right side of the slide. We expect our balanced platform to deliver stable results. Our preliminary analysis of the winter storm financial impact is expected to be within our current guidance range. This preliminary assessment incorporates internal estimates on customer meter and settlement data, which have not been finalized yet.  It also makes assumption on potential customer and counterparty credit risk and ERCOT-default allocations. We have also performed a stress test on our assumptions resulting in a potential outcome, although at a lower probability of plus/minus $100 million to our guidance ranges. As information becomes available, we'll be able to narrow this kind of outcomes.  
Moving to the 2020 operational and financial highlights on Slide 6. Beginning with our 2020 scorecard, we executed on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results and had our best safety year ever. I want to take a moment to thank and commend all of my colleagues as this is now the third straight year we set a new record for safety, an incredible accomplishment. 
Our 3-year transformation plan goals were fully achieved in 2020. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, achieved a strong balance sheet, established a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation.  
Over the last 5 years, we have been evolving our platform to move closer to the customer. In 2020, we took major steps towards this goal with key highlights, including the acquisition of Direct Energy, and diversifying our supply strategy through signing renewable PPAs in ERCOT and launching RFPs in the East. We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio by growing retail and reducing generation. I look forward to sharing with you the next chapter during our Spring Analyst Day.  
Now moving to the financial results on the right-hand side of the slide. We delivered $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range; and $1.547 billion of free cash flow before growth, which includes the pulling forward of certain items from 2021 into 2020 in order to fund the Direct Energy acquisition. Gaetan will provide more detail on the free cash flow later in the presentation.  
I want to note that our 2020 carbon emissions came in below our 2025 50% reduction goal. We're not adjusting our 2025 targets today, but this highlights our efforts in reducing carbon emissions. Finally, as I previously stated, we're maintaining our guidance ranges for 2021.  
Turning to Slide 7. I want to provide an update on the Direct Energy integration. This transaction presented a step change for us as we move closer to the customer by significantly expanding our customer network and home services. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, it also provides a significant opportunity to leverage our operating platform and achieve significant synergies. This transaction advanced our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure.  
With Direct Energy close, NRG now have the strongest collection of competitive power brands, offering energy products and services in North America. The Direct Energy acquisition significantly expands our residential and business footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas. Both residential and business customers are able to leverage our platforms for solutions that feed their specific needs, elevating consumer choice to a whole new level.  
Our integration efforts are well underway. And today, we are reaffirming the planned targets. We're already making significant progress on talent assessment, collateral management and systems integration. Throughout this integration process, we are focused on high grading our organization through retaining the best and diverse talent and further deepening our customer-focused culture.  The integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan and has a similar governance structure. I am highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergies outlined on the slide.  
On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see a scorecard that looks familiar and that is because it is how we reported our transformation plan progress to all of you. We plan to update this scorecard with our results in order to provide transparency and keep you informed of our progress.  
Next, turning to Slide 8 for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. I highlighted last quarter that we were actively focused on monetizing noncore assets with a target to realize a minimum of $250 million in equity proceeds within 6 to 12 months. I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, to sell a 4.8-gigawatt portfolio of fossil fuel assets across New York, Connecticut and California for $760 million in cash proceeds or roughly 4x EBITDA.  
As you can see on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, many of these assets are nearing end of life and with economics dependent upon capacity markets. Excluding Sunrise, the average expected capacity factors ranges between 0% to 6%. This is a good transaction for us. It further streamlines our business and addresses terminal value and earnings concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth.  Our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. The asset sale is targeted to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net cash proceeds after associated debt reduction will be allocated using our capital allocation framework.  
Before turning over the call to Gaetan for the financial review, I want to thank Kirk Andrews for his decade of service at NRG. Over the last 10 years, Kirk has not only been a colleague, but also a trusted friend. And I believe I speak for the entire organization when I say that we all wish him well and the best in his future endeavors. Our finance team is in capable hands with Gaetan Frotte, our Treasurer, stepping in as Interim CFO. 
With that, I will pass it over to Gaetan for the financial review."

I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the full year results and our 2021 guidance. Last year, NRG delivered slightly more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. So our adjuste",1060,"Thank you, Mauricio. 
I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the full year results and our 2021 guidance. Last year, NRG delivered slightly more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. So our adjusted EBITDA for the year is in line with our 2020 guidance, and I would note that it includes the impact of COVID-19 that came in at only $25 million or half of our original cost expectations.  
Moving to free cash flow before growth. Year-end results are $47 million higher than our latest midpoint of guidance driven by the inclusion of $43 million in distribution from Agua Caliente in 2020, just prior to the sale of the project in early February. 
Finally, from a balance sheet standpoint, 2020 was also very successful with a year-end leverage close to 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which is at the strongest end of our targeted range.  In addition, we had over $7 billion of liquidity accumulated in anticipation of the acquisition of Direct Energy in early January. A portion of that liquidity proved very useful during the recent winter storm.  
Moving to 2021 guidance. As included in the closing announcement for Direct Energy, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and our 2021 free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion. As mentioned by Mauricio before, we are maintaining our guidance range for 2021 based on our preliminary analysis of the impact of the Winter Storm Uri on our results.  
Based on a stress analysis, we believe that the financial impact on the guidance range could vary by plus or minus $100 million, subject to final customer meter and settlement data, counterparty credit risk and expected ERCOT-default allocation. 
Finally, we have signed a PSA to sell 4.8 gigawatt of generation assets in our East West region to an affiliate of ArcLight for $760 million, and we anticipate closing to occur by the end of the year. These assets contribute approximately $190 million of adjusted EBITDA and approximately $130 million of free cash flow before growth to energy. I would note that these numbers have not been yet deducted from our guidance range.  
Turning to the sources and uses for Direct Energy on Slide 11. We wanted to provide a bridge between the numbers reported during our last earnings call in early November when we discussed eliminating the need for $750 million of preferred equity and the actual results after closing the acquisition last January.  So starting from the left with the $3.745 billion of total sources and uses as discussed last quarter, we first lowered NRG cash by $100 million to reflect the lower cash reserves available at year-end as shown on Slide 22 of the Appendix. This was offset with an equivalent temporary growth under the revolver at closing.  
Next, we used $13 million of incremental financing cost savings minus $2 million of initial discount on our bond issuance to reduce the temporary draw under the revolver by $11 million. In the next column, we reflected $77 million for a purchase price adjustment that was paid to Centrica due in part to the larger cash balance available at Direct Energy when we acquired the company. This was also financed through a temporary draw under our revolver.  
Finally, we show the impact from acquired cash and margin collateral. Since at closing, Direct Energy had $233 million in cash margin posted and $152 million of cash and cash equivalents for a total of $385 million of cash on its -- and equivalents on its balance sheet. This was higher than we had anticipated last quarter, and we were able to use it after closing to repay the $160 million temporary draw under the revolver and reduced the NRG cash allocated to the acquisition by $219 million. More importantly, it also means more cash is available for deleveraging in 2021, which eliminates the need to use future asset sale proceeds to achieve our investment-grade credit metrics by year-end.  
I will now turn to Slide 12 where we are updating the combined 2021 capital allocation provided last quarter. Please note that changes on this slide are indicated in blue. Starting from the left, we have adjusted the 2021 excess cash to reflect the final $715 million of cash reserve at the end of 2020. The $1.54 billion updated free cash flow before growth, including Direct Energy, based on the midpoint of our guidance range and finally, the $120 million of net proceeds from the sale of our remaining equity stake in Agua Caliente, all these represent a total of $2.375 billion available.  
Then moving on to the next change on the third column. We updated the capital allocated to the direct acquisition, which is now at $496 million, as shown on the previous slide.  Finally, given the reduced cash needs for the acquisition, we are allocating our additional excess cash of $219 million to debt reduction. This brings our total debt reduction to nearly $1.2 billion, bringing us to within our targeted investment-grade metrics in 2021 and importantly, without the need for asset sale proceeds that we had mentioned before. 
Finally, on Slide 13, I will start on the left with our 2021 credit metrics, which is now based on our finalized plan shown in the middle column. After adjusting our corporate balance for the increased debt reduction from 2021 capital allocation, our 2021 net debt balance is approximately $7 billion, which, based on the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA, implies a pro forma ratio of 2.65x net debt to EBITDA, well within the range of our targeted investment-grade metrics. 
Turning to the right. We also wanted to update you on our strong liquidity position at the end of last week, which, at $3.8 billion, is ample enough to continue supporting our business even during periods of stress like we experienced over the last 2 weeks. 
In conclusion, and as discussed earlier, after proving the resilient performance of our integrated model during these trying times for Texas and our capital allocation plan to achieve investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2021, we continue to believe in our ability to reach investment-grade ratings by the end of 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ] or early 2022. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

So I think that process is going to take some time, and the first steps already happened last week. I mean I think everybody has seen the hearings down in Austin. I had the opportunity to participate. And that to me, it is the prudent first step. Having spent some time down there and just looking comprehensively at the -- at what happened, I will say that there is perhaps 3 themes that legislatures and other stakeholders will be looking at.  
First is the hardening of the energy system from natural gas to power generation. I think it is clear that when the power generation has made up of close to 50% of the total capacity fueled by natural gas. Natural gas -- the natural gas system becomes critical, and it needs to be hardened just as rigorous as the power generation system. 
The second thing, I think there is going to be a conversation around the market design. And the focus, from my perspective, should be around the reserve margins and what is the excess capacity that we want to have in the ERCOT system to make sure that this doesn't happen again with perhaps more extreme weather conditions than in the past. And I think part of this excess capacity is not just the quantity of capacity, but also the quality of capacity. And what I mean about the quality, it is fuel diversification. 
And then I think, finally, it is the communications. And to me, it is clear that communications needed to be a lot more than what we experienced last week. First is the communication between the power and the natural gas systems and the coordination between the 2. Second, it is the communication between EVUs who were responsible of implementing the power outages directed by ERCOT, and the reps who have the relationship with the customer.  I mean I think that communication is to be a lot stronger. And we need to evaluate and assess a -- perhaps an alert system that tells our communities when something like this is going to happen and the potential risk. 
And then finally, I just -- I think it is important that we recognize just the magnitude of this winter storm. I mean any way you see it, it was historic. And as we are assessing these 3 things, particularly the hardening, we just need to make sure that is that the -- are we rebaselining our winterization efforts with this 100-year winter storm that we all live. 
So that would be my initial comments, Steve. Obviously, I mean we're only in the beginning phase of this, but -- and I think we need to -- I think all the parties from what I can gather in my time in Austin, they want to take their time to make sure that they really fully understand what caused it so they can be thorough and have changes that will be effective and long lasting."

I think I said it in the past that generation, the portfolio of generation that we have has to help us better serve our customers. 
So when you take a step back, obviously, owning physical generation, it is important. But we can get some of the characteristics of physical generation through bilateral agreements. It doesn't -- we don't have to own it all the time or always to be able to have those characteristics. We can actually structure some of those agreements, so we can benefit and utilize these -- the characteristics of physical generation. 
I will say that the strength that we all saw in the system last week is giving us already lessons learned on how we should be thinking about counterparty performance, counterparty risk. And the team is already looking at the lessons learned on our commercial team, which, by the way, I just want to give a big kudos to both commercial operations and plant operations because they absolutely maximized the amount of generation that we were giving to the system and, at the same time, maintaining the stability and the balance on our portfolio. 
So that's how I think about it, Steve. And obviously, our matching of generation and retail is always informed by market conditions. So it's not like set it and forget it."

We -- as we were approaching the storm, the commercial team took the necessary steps to strengthen our position going into the storm both on natural gas and power hedges. In addition to that, our plant operations people brought in almost 2,000 megawatts of generation that normally, in most of the circumstances never run in the winter and we actually have a reserve for summer operations. 
So that's another testament of strengthening our position as we go into the storm. And then as you were looking at -- as you look at our load obligations across the state, it's pretty well diversified between Houston and Dallas and the north. 
So I think it was a good, good solid execution with the right foundation in terms of the integrated portfolio and the necessary steps to get ready for it. 
So Chris, is there something more that you want to add?"

Look, if you look at it, our strategy is to have a mix of physical gen and market purchases and notwithstanding the problems we face, frankly, on both sides, right, with unit outages and then counterparty issues that we're working through this strategy of diversified supply seems to have held together pretty well. 
As we saw the forecast get colder and colder, we brought more generation, like Mauricio mentioned, not a seasonal layup, and we bought more power from the market. Like let's be clear, we were prepping to cover loads in the high 60s and low 70s, you know what I mean, in terms of thousands of megawatts load. We were also, don't forget, able to use our gas storage and transportation contracts and our ability to find and buy what I will politely describe as obscenely expensive gas in order to keep those gas units of ours producing the megawatts that the grid needed. I know that not everybody was able to do that, but the combination of our contracts and working out in the market, we were able to cover it. 
So that is kind of how the whole thing worked out to where we think we're still within the guidance range, plus or minus the $100 million."

And I was very clear, the hardening of the system cannot only happen on the power generation side, it has to happen also on the natural gas system. I mean when 45% of our total generation capacity in Texas is fueled by natural gas, they're completely interdependent. And so that interdependency, it needs to be expanded when we're thinking about the hardening of the system, the winterization of the system. The second thing is the communications. Obviously, there needs to be a lot more coordination between natural gas and power. And just like we talk about fuel diversification on power generation, we need to be thinking about redundancy on critical parts of the gas system, like compressor stations. Does it make sense to have a backhoe generation? What are the standards for winterization at the wellhead? I mean there is a number of things that can happen on the gas system side. And that will also -- we need to review the winterization protocols on the power generation side. I mean the last time there was a recommendation was in 2011. And the wind -- the storm in 2011, I mean I have this stat that I think puts things in perspective. The 3-day stretch temperature, this winter storm I think ranks as the third coldest in the last 130 years. 2011 was the sixth year. So I think that should give you a pretty good context in terms of what was the baseline that was used for the winterization of the power generation. And I think there's going to be a conversation about rebaselining that. So some of that is going to happen. 
And I think it has to be also beyond power generation. It has to be around the customer and the communications with the customer. I mean when you're talking about power outages and rolling power outages, first, you need to make sure that you communicate with the customers. The EVUs responsible for implementing these load shares at the direction of ERCOT that is balancing the system. And so do we need to review the protocol in terms of how that is implemented, what is the communication protocol between the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail energy providers that have the relationship with the customer. So all of these things are going to have to be taken into consideration. And I think I have to say, I mean the Texas legislature is really doing the right thing in terms of doing this exhaustive and comprehensive root cost analysis."

NRG remains committed to helping our customers and communities recover from the devastating winter storm and to bring solutions that ensure an event like this never happens again. We also want to provide you an update on the progress made in advancing our customer-centric strategy by reorganizing around the customer and strengthening our platform. 
I want to start on Slide 4. We have now processed 100% of the information received from the mid-April 55-day resettlement and issued all expected invoices to our customers. The updated financial impact from winter Storm Uri, net of our mitigation efforts, is expected to be a net loss of $500 million to $700 million. In order to provide you with more transparency to better understand and make your own judgment on how our platform perform, I am going to break down the components of the gross financial impact into 2 categories: controllable and uncontrollable. 
On the controllable side, throughout the event, we maintained a balanced position while absorbing very high natural gas prices, operational issues at our plants and protecting our residential retail customers from high electricity prices. 
In total, our platform was positive $17 million with estimated bad debt, primarily from C&I customers accounting for $109 million. 
Moving to the 3 uncontrollable items. First, the recently acquired Direct Energy portfolio had a heat recall option with a counterparty that did not perform, resulting in a $393 million gross loss. 
Following the event, we reexamined the entire hedge book from Direct and determined that this was an isolated issue. We're currently engaging discussions with the counterparty. And if satisfactory result is not reached, we plan to vigorously pursue recovery through all avenues. 
Next, we are recognizing a $95 million gross loss due to ERCOT default allocations. These losses comprised of a $83 million cash short pay, plus $12 million NPV of the remaining $102 million on to ERCOT over the next 96 years. 
As a reminder, ERCOT realized defaults of $3 billion, primarily from through regulated COP, Brussels and Rayburn. The state legislature appreciates the impact of the COP defaults in the broader market and is considering securitization as a way to soften the impact to customers and other market participants. 
Finally, we are recognizing a $395 million loss due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the last 32 hours, when ERCOT kept the market clearing price at the cap, despite having more than 10 gigawatts in reserves. 
Our platform was balanced during this time, but nonetheless, we were uplifted these extraordinary charges. To help put this in context for you, over no time in history has this charge exceeded $5 million. The state legislature is considering also securitization for these charges, given they are the result of unforeseen penal hedgeable actions by ERCOT. 
We are focused on supporting the PUCT and ERCOT in the implementation of policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. 
In total, we expect our estimated gross financial losses to be reduced by $275 million to $475 million through bad debt mitigation, recovery of Direct Energy hedged nonperformance, ERCOT default and not lift securitizations and onetime savings, resulting in a net loss of $500 million to $700 million. We have a high level of confidence in the net range and see manageable risks around the 180-day settlements and further bad debt escalations. 
Now I want to take some time and discuss the solutions we're focused on -- in Texas. We believe they will improve grid reliability, strengthen our market, and more importantly, avoid a systemic failure of the energy system in the future. 
Since the storm, we have actively engaged in discussions with legislative members and propose various changes to make Texas more resilient. I want to thank the members of the Texas legislature for their continued leadership on these key issues. 
While there are many proposals in the Texas legislator right now, including many of which we are working actively on. I want to focus here on 3 concepts that the legislature has made a priority, and I believe are critical to ensure what happened in February never happens again. 
Hardening of the system, improving communication and market design changes. Beginning with system hardening, where the recession of assets is key to improve the overall reliability of the grid. NRG has a strong and comprehensive winterization program that begins with lessons learned from prior winter seasons and ends with our annual declaration of completion of the winter weatherization preparations to ERCOT and the PUCT by November 30. 
The implementation of formal winterization rules and force through penalties and audits is something we support. 
With that said, 1 of the biggest lessons learned from this storm is how interactive and interconnected the electric and natural gas sectors are and our focus is not just on hardening the power generation side of the equation. Instead, we believe the entire system, including natural gas, needs to be hardened as they say from wellhead to light bolt. 
Next, I want to talk about communications. During the storm, the lack of communication between all market participants and stakeholders was unacceptable. Formal coordination between the Public Utility Commission, ERCOT, the Railroad Commission and key stakeholders will greatly improve the amount of information available as well as informed decision-making during future events. 
In addition, improving the dialogue between TV used during load-shed events and retailers will greatly improve the amount of information available to customers. Improved communication coupled with a state-wide emergency alert system will ensure all Texas can stay informed about the status of the grid during times of emergency. 
Finally, regarding market design changes, our focus is on improving reliability through competitive solutions in the energy and reserve markets, not through reregulated generation solutions with guaranteed profits or a 1-sized feed all capacity procurement. 
For residential customers, banning index wholesale products, as we already do as a company, is a solution that will protect residential customers from being exposed to the volatile swings in the market. Addressing these 3 key areas will significantly enhance grid stability, and we look forward to continuing to engage with the Texas legislature in the coming weeks. 
Now moving to our regular business highlights on Slide 6. We have excluded the impact of winter storm Uri from all our numbers as we have done previously from onetime events. Our intention is to provide transparency to the investment community regarding the recurring earnings power of our business, particularly given this was the first quarter of our ownership of Direct Energy. And separating what we believe to be nonrecurring impacts of the combined business as a result of Uri. 
Throughout today's presentation, we have made significant effort to be as transparent as possible on both the cost of Uri related losses and the onetime financial impact so that you can evaluate the financial performance in either context. 
Gaetan will provide additional details later in the presentation. NRG delivered $567 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, excluding onetime financial impacts from the storm. This is a 62% increase from the same period last year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Notably, the addition of Direct Energy's East electric and natural gas businesses helps flatten our quarterly earnings and free cash flow seasonality. 
As I mentioned before, we are reinstating our previous financial guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for 2021, excluding Uri. 
Just to remind everyone, on March 17, we temporarily suspended the 2021 guidance to reflect the significant uncertainty of Uri. 
While some uncertainty remains, we believe we have received enough data to provide a range of our cost. 
Beyond Uri, we continue to advance our Direct Energy integration plan. Following the close in early January, we immediately began the integration process, achieving $51 million of our 2021 synergy target. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve both the 2021 and full plan targets. 
As part of the Direct Energy integration, and to further simplify our business operations, today we're announcing the designation of Houston at the sole location of our corporate headquarters. 
Texas is already home to our largest customer and employee base. It's a great place to do business, and Houston continues to be at the forefront of energy and technology with 1 of the most diverse workforces in the country. We will continue to maintain regional offices in the markets that we serve, as we expand our business outside of Texas. 
We're also making good progress in executing our customer-centric strategy. In January, we closed on the Direct Energy transaction, forming the leading North American integrated energy and home services company, serving a network of 6 million customers. In March, we announced the agreement to sell a 4.8 gigawatt portfolio of noncore fossil assets which helps simplify and decarbonize our portfolio. And since the last earnings call, we increased our ERCOT renewable purchase power agreements by nearly 400 megawatts now totaling approximately 2.2 gigawatts. 
Last on our credit metrics. Despite the impact of winter storm Uri, we expect to be at 3x leverage by the end of 2021 after paying down $385 million of debt from cash available for allocation. We're working with the credit agencies to review the impact of winter storm Uri on the timing of achieving investment-grade ratings. An extension in timeline could give us an opportunity to achieve our metrics either through debt reduction and/or EBITDA growth. 
I will be providing more details on capital allocation and our full strategic outlook during our Spring Investor Day. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for our summer outlook. First, from a high level, we're expecting neutral to favorable summer weather and continued economic recovery to result in a year-on-year load growth. Despite this low growth, we're expecting reserve margins to be robust, resulting in stable to lower power prices. 
Just to remind everyone, high- low price is good for our business. As you can see on the upper left-hand chart, now is predicting a slightly harder than normal summer within the Eastern Texas markets. We expect this outlook to trend towards normal with a positive bias as we near summer. 
Moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. COVID related electric demand continues to recover across markets with ERCOT demonstrating resilience. As a reminder, COVID stay at home impact on load is most pronounced during the shoulder season and less in the summer. 
From a market perspective, we see 2021 as a recovery year across all our markets. 
In ERCOT, we expect a return to normal 2% annual load growth with residential uses in ERCOT remaining slightly elevated as stay at home trends remain, while C&I usage improves throughout the year, returning to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. 
In the East, we see similar trends, although we believe C&I recovery to be pre-pandemic levels could take an additional 12 to 18 months given stronger stay at home trends. 
Now as it relates to NRG, we continue to see strong residential growth across all markets, and we expect to be a relative winner given our multi-brand and multichannel platform. 
In ERCOT, we're seeing lower attrition rates, and incremental growth opportunities through our multichannel approach and flight to quality following Uri. 
In the East, we're also realizing lower attrition. But given the less favorable regulatory framework, we depend more on face-to-face sales to win customers. 
For planning purposes, we are assuming normal customer growth in ERCOT and a slight contraction in the East as it more closely tracks the economic reopenings. On retail supply cost, we see a little risk of sustained high prices this summer, given robust summer reserve margins across all our core markets. 
While it is still early, we're eager for the EVgo evolution and implementation of the Biden infrastructure plan. As we believe it will amplify the electrification of the economy through smart technology and cleaner energy choices. 
So with this positive backdrop, we continue to make good progress in executing our customer-centric strategy, as you can see on Slide 8. 
On the Direct Energy integration, this transaction presented a step change for us as we move closer to the customer by significantly expanding our customer network and home services. 
During the first quarter, we achieved $51 million or 38% of our 2021 synergy target. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve both the 2021 and full plan targets, and we plan to update this scorecard quarterly in order to provide transparency and keep you informed of our progress. 
We are on track to close on the 4.8 gigawatt asset sale in the fourth quarter. This is a good transaction for us as it further streamlines our business and address terminal value and earnings concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth. 
Our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. 
Finally, we are preparing for our Investor Day. We continue to target late spring, and given the flexibility afforded by the virtual format, we will announce the event 2 or 3 weeks prior to best manage around the Texas resolution. 
So with that, I will pass it to Gaetan for the financial review."

I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the first quarter results and Uri's financial impact. On the upper left side of the slide, we have shown our quarterly results and reinstated guidance after excluding the onetime impact of",927,"Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the first quarter results and Uri's financial impact. 
On the upper left side of the slide, we have shown our quarterly results and reinstated guidance after excluding the onetime impact of winter storm Uri, which we are showing separately on the right. As mentioned by Mauricio, we believe that this better reflects the recurring earnings power of our business following the acquisition of Direct Energy, and it is consistent with our established practice of excluding extraordinary events. 
For the quarter, NRG delivered $567 million in adjusted EBITDA or $218 million higher than the first quarter of last year, excluding $967 million impact from winter storm Uri. 
This increase is driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy, which generates approximately 2/3 of its EBITDA during the winter months, given the seasonal shape of East electric and natural gas load. This seasonality will help flatten NRG's future earnings profile throughout the year. Specific to direct energy, we are on track to realize $500 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021. We are also on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 as well with $51 million realized in the first quarter, and a goal of at least $300 million annual run rate by 2023. 
Turning now your attention to the table on the right, the total anticipated growth impact from winter storm Uri is now $975 million. The increase since our last communication is primarily driven by the 55-day resettlement information from ERCOT, which affected our uplift cost and load estimates and added some incremental results for counterparty credit risk, all of which were partially offset by discounting the ERCOT default charges. 
We continue to pursue various offselling solution estimated to be in the range of $275 million to $475 million. This would reduce the economic impact to a net amount of $500 million to $700 million. 
From a cash standpoint, based on $150 million of estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers in 2022. The total negative cash impact in 2021 is expected to be approximately $150 million lower at $350 million to $550 million, including the effect of the offsets previously mentioned. 
Finally, we are reinstating our 2021 guidance at the original ranges of $2.4 to $2.6 billion for our adjusted EBITDA and $144 billion to $164 billion for our free cash flow before growth. 
I will now turn to Slide 11, where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. 
Changes on this slide from last quarter are indicated in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was reduced by $38 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustment. 
Moving on to the next column. The estimated winter storm Uri capital allocation impact is $825 million, net of anticipated customer bill credit outstanding at the end of the year, and would be at $450 million after deducting the midpoint of our estimated mitigation efforts of $375 million. 
This has reduced our original deleveraging plan in 2021. However, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving our credit metrics over time. Absent any mitigation offset recoveries, which are shown in the far right of the chart, the company will still pay down debt by $385 million in 2021 and continue to delever over time to meet its credit profile goals. 
Importantly, this does not include any deleveraging associated with the sale of our East and West assets, which is still slated to close later this year. 
Moving on to Slide 12. I will start on the left with our 2021 credit metrics. After adjusting our corporate debt balance for the reduction from our 2021 capital allocation and minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.8 billion. This, when based on the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA, implies a ratio of just under [ 3x net to ] adjusted EBITDA at the end of the year. This notably excludes the onetime impact of winter Storm Uri, which we also expect to be excluded by the rating agencies. 
On the topic of raining, we continue to work with the agencies to review winter Storm Uri's impact on the time line and the requirements to achieve investment grade. We remain committed to strong credit metrics and continue to operate under the assumption that investment-grade ratings will be awarded shortly after achieving the targeted metrics. But we're not controlling this process. And we realized that given the circumstances, it could take the agencies much longer than previously anticipated to be comfortable granting us an IG rating. 
I would note that if the timeline is extended, it could also give us an opportunity to achieve our metrics either through debt reduction and/or EBITDA growth. 
Turning to the right side of the slide. We also wanted to update you on our latest liquidity position, which are -- which had $4.1 billion as of a few days ago, remains very strong and sufficient to continue supporting our business even during a period of stress. 
In conclusion, we are reinstating our EBITDA and free cash flow before growth to the original guidance provided in the last earnings call, excluding the impact of winter Storm Uri. 
While the storm has impacted our capital allocation plan, we have maintained a strong liquidity position before, during and after the event, what our core business continues to perform as otherwise expected. 
With this, I will hand it back to Mauricio."

I recognize that winter Storm Uri has impacted investor confidence in ERCOT's market design and the durability of our cash flow. 
But I want to be clear. Given the steps being discussed in the Texas legislature and the actions by market participants, I don't believe an event like this can happen again. 
The systemic failure was the result of a lack of winter stress planning, which was then amplified by poor electric and natural gas coordination and protocols to orderly restore the energy system and communicate with customers. 
Energy is a key pillar to Texas outsized growth and all stakeholders are focused on addressing winter reliability swiftly and comprehensively. ERCOT's winter planning parameters will be enhanced. Grid coordination will be improved and protocols for a large-scale emergency will be established. 
Now finally, today, following our extensive CFO search, I am pleased to announce that Alberto Fornaro will join our team as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective June 1. 
Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. Alberto joins us from Cupa, the world's fifth largest e-commerce platform, where he served as Group Chief Financial Officer and Senior Advisor. 
Before that, he served as CFO for public and private companies, including international game technology, a leading gaming company; Dusan, a contact and heavy construction equipment company; and TechnoGen, the world's second largest manufacturer of fitness equipment. 
I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal fit to enhance our decisive move closer to the customer. 
I also want to take a moment to recognize Gaetan Frotte for stepping in as interim CFO and leading the finance organization during this challenging time. Gaetan is a very important and valuable member of our leadership team. 
On behalf of everyone at NRG, thank you, Gaetan, for your leadership and dedication.

As we've said, the impact in the first quarter is $967 million. And then over time, there would be [ $8 million ] of incremental cost associated with it. The way to think about it is all of the cost of goods sold portion of that $975 million has been [indiscernible] by now. All of the gas settlement and all of those things have been done. But obviously, on the working capital side, some of the receivables have been have been issued, the billing has been issued, but the cash hasn't been paid yet, and you will probably have noticed at the end of the first quarter that we had a large receivable balance. But then in our liquidity numbers as of a few days ago, our liquidity has gone up significantly, which shows the collection that we've enjoyed during the month of April. So this is the second moving piece. 
And then the last moving piece is the 1 we highlighted on Page 10, which is the deferred credits. And we've estimate this to be $150 million for 2021 with an impact basically deferred into 2022. So those are the main moving pieces here around the cash. You should assume that based on those, the cash impact for the first quarter is below the $975 million, basically. Based on the 10-K, you will be able to reconcile that it's roughly $100 million below that."

I think 1 thing that is important to note is, as we're thinking about the return to the office, we all appreciate that remote work is going to be more prevalent in the future, and we've gotten very comfortable with that. We've been running our company in a very efficient way. So I would expect that as we reimagine the workspace of the future, that hybrid and remote work will be more prevalent. And we actually have inside the organization something that I call Workplace '21, which is really a group of a committee that is thinking through our real estate needs, what are we going to do in terms of which employees need to work remote, hybrid, in person in the office, how do we think about maintaining the culture of the company through this new way of working, how do we extend some of our corporate values like safety and well-being beyond the offices and into homes? 
So I mean, this is very comprehensive. We, as a company, are going to be flexible with our employee. We recognize that in order to attract the best talent, we have to keep up with technology and the means by which our employees are more fulfilled and satisfied. 
So I'm very pleased with the move. I think, as I said on my remarks, I mean, Houston is an incredible city in terms of leading the energy transformation, in terms of technology. They have a very diverse workforce. Many of our customers or the majority of our customers already reside in Texas. Many of our employees are already there.

I'm joined this morning by Gaetan Frotte, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, and also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.  
Over the past few months, we have discussed in detail the unprecedented nature of winter storm Uri. The impact it had on the entire energy system, the steps that we took to prepare our Texas platform and the support we provided to our customers and communities. Today, and with the benefit of additional information, we are providing more clarity on the financial impact to our company, the steps we're taking to mitigate this onetime event and reinstating 2021 financial guidance.  
We continue to work closely with legislators, regulators and all market participants to introduce comprehensive solutions across the entire energy system to address issues and shortcomings that were appearing during the storm.  
NRG remains committed to helping our customers and communities recover from the devastating winter storm and to bring solutions that ensure an event like this never happens again. We also want to provide you an update on the progress made in advancing our customer-centric strategy by reorganizing around the customer and strengthening our platform.  
I want to start on Slide 4. We have now processed 100% of the information received from the mid-April 55-day resettlement and issued all expected invoices to our customers. The updated financial impact from winter Storm Uri, net of our mitigation efforts, is expected to be a net loss of $500 million to $700 million. In order to provide you with more transparency to better understand and make your own judgment on how our platform perform, I am going to break down the components of the gross financial impact into 2 categories: controllable and uncontrollable.  
On the controllable side, throughout the event, we maintained a balanced position while absorbing very high natural gas prices, operational issues at our plants and protecting our residential retail customers from high electricity prices.  
In total, our platform was positive $17 million with estimated bad debt, primarily from C&I customers accounting for $109 million.  
Moving to the 3 uncontrollable items. First, the recently acquired Direct Energy portfolio had a heat recall option with a counterparty that did not perform, resulting in a $393 million gross loss.  
Following the event, we reexamined the entire hedge book from Direct and determined that this was an isolated issue. We're currently engaging discussions with the counterparty and if satisfactory result is not reached, we plan to vigorously pursue recovery through all avenues.  
Next, we are recognizing a $95 million gross loss due to ERCOT default allocations. These losses comprised of a $83 million cash short pay, plus $12 million NPV of the remaining $102 million on to ERCOT over the next 96 years.  
As a reminder, ERCOT realized defaults of $3 billion, primarily from through regulated co-ops, Brazos and Rayburn. The state legislature appreciates the impact of the co-op defaults in the broader market and is considering securitization as a way to soften the impact to customers and other market participants.  
Finally, we are recognizing a $395 million loss due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the last 32 hours, when ERCOT kept the market clearing price at the cap, despite having more than 10 gigawatts in reserves.  
Our platform was balanced during this time, but nonetheless, we were uplifted these extraordinary charges. To help put this in context for you, over no time in history has this charge exceeded $5 million. The state legislature is considering also securitization for these charges, given they are the result of unforeseen and unhedgeable actions by ERCOT.  
We are focused on supporting the PUCT and ERCOT in the implementation of policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future.  
In total, we expect our estimated gross financial losses to be reduced by $275 million to $475 million through bad debt mitigation, recovery of Direct Energy hedged nonperformance, ERCOT default and uplift securitizations and onetime savings, resulting in a net loss of $500 million to $700 million. We have a high level of confidence in the net range and see manageable risks around the 180-day settlements and further bad debt escalations.  
Now I want to take some time and discuss the solutions we're focused on -- in Texas. We believe they will improve grid reliability, strengthen our market, and more importantly, avoid a systemic failure of the energy system in the future.  
Since the storm, we have actively engaged in discussions with legislative members and propose various changes to make Texas more resilient. I want to thank the members of the Texas legislature for their continued leadership on these key issues.  
While there are many proposals in the Texas legislator right now, including many of which we are working actively on. I want to focus here on 3 concepts that the legislature has made a priority, and I believe are critical to ensure what happened in February never happens again.  Hardening of the system, improving communication and market design changes. 
Beginning with system hardening. Weatherization of assets is key to improve the overall reliability of the grid. NRG has a strong and comprehensive winterization program that begins with lessons learned from prior winter seasons and ends with our annual declaration of completion of the winter weatherization preparations to ERCOT and the PUCT by November 30.  
The implementation of formal winterization rules and force through penalties and audits is something we support.  
With that said, one of the biggest lessons learned from this storm is how interactive and interconnected the electric and natural gas sectors are, and our focus is not just on hardening the power generation side of the equation. Instead, we believe the entire system, including natural gas, needs to be hardened as they say from wellhead to lightbulb.  
Next, I want to talk about communications. During the storm, the lack of communication between all market participants and stakeholders was unacceptable. Formal coordination between the Public Utility Commission, ERCOT, the Railroad Commission and key stakeholders will greatly improve the amount of information available as well as informed decision-making during future events.  
In addition, improving the dialogue between TV used during load-shed events and retailers will greatly improve the amount of information available to customers. Improved communication coupled with a state-wide emergency alert system will ensure all Texas can stay informed about the status of the grid during times of emergency.  
Finally, regarding market design changes, our focus is on improving reliability through competitive solutions in the energy and reserve markets, not through reregulated generation solutions with guaranteed profits or a one-size-fits-all capacity procurement.  
For residential customers, banning index wholesale products, as we already do as a company, is a solution that will protect residential customers from being exposed to the volatile swings in the market. Addressing these 3 key areas will significantly enhance grid stability, and we look forward to continuing to engage with the Texas legislature in the coming weeks.  
Now moving to our regular business highlights on Slide 6. We have excluded the impact of winter storm Uri from all our numbers as we have done previously from onetime events. Our intention is to provide transparency to the investment community regarding the recurring earnings power of our business, particularly given this was the first quarter of our ownership of Direct Energy. And separating what we believe to be nonrecurring impacts of the combined business as a result of Uri.  
Throughout today's presentation, we have made significant effort to be as transparent as possible on both the cost of Uri related losses and the onetime financial impact so that you can evaluate the financial performance in either context.  
Gaetan will provide additional details later in the presentation. NRG delivered $567 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, excluding onetime financial impacts from the storm. This is a 62% increase from the same period last year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Notably, the addition of Direct Energy's East electric and natural gas businesses helps flatten our quarterly earnings and free cash flow seasonality.  
As I mentioned before, we are reinstating our previous financial guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for 2021, excluding Uri.  
Just to remind everyone, on March 17, we temporarily suspended the 2021 guidance to reflect the significant uncertainty of Uri.  
While some uncertainty remains, we believe we have received enough data to provide a range of outcomes.  
Beyond Uri, we continue to advance our Direct Energy integration plan. Following the close in early January, we immediately began the integration process, achieving $51 million of our 2021 synergy target. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve both the 2021 and full plan targets.  
As part of the Direct Energy integration, and to further simplify our business operations, today we're announcing the designation of Houston at the sole location of our corporate headquarters.  
Texas is already home to our largest customer and employee base. It's a great place to do business, and Houston continues to be at the forefront of energy and technology with one of the most diverse workforces in the country. We will continue to maintain regional offices in the markets that we serve, as we expand our business outside of Texas.  
We're also making good progress in executing our customer-centric strategy. In January, we closed on the Direct Energy transaction, forming the leading North American integrated energy and home services company, serving a network of 6 million customers. In March, we announced the agreement to sell a 4.8 gigawatt portfolio of noncore fossil assets which helps simplify and decarbonize our portfolio. And since the last earnings call, we increased our ERCOT renewable purchase power agreements by nearly 400 megawatts now totaling approximately 2.2 gigawatts.  
Last on our credit metrics. Despite the impact of winter storm Uri, we expect to be at 3x leverage by the end of 2021 after paying down $385 million of debt from cash available for allocation. We're working with the credit agencies to review the impact of winter storm Uri on the timing of achieving investment-grade ratings. An extension in timeline could give us an opportunity to achieve our metrics either through debt reduction and/or EBITDA growth.  
I will be providing more details on capital allocation and our full strategic outlook during our Spring Investor Day.  
Now turning to Slide 7 for our summer outlook. First, from a high level, we're expecting neutral-to-favorable summer weather and continued economic recovery to result in a year-on-year load growth. Despite this low growth, we're expecting reserve margins to be robust, resulting in stable-to-lower power prices.  
Just to remind everyone, high load, low price is good for our business. As you can see on the upper left-hand chart, NOAA is predicting a slightly harder than normal summer within the Eastern Texas markets. We expect this outlook to trend towards normal with a positive bias as we near summer.  
Moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. COVID-related electric demand continues to recover across markets with ERCOT demonstrating resilience. As a reminder, COVID stay-at-home impact on load is most pronounced during the shoulder season and less in the summer.  
From a market perspective, we see 2021 as a recovery year across all our markets. In ERCOT, we expect a return to normal 2% annual load growth with residential usage in ERCOT remaining slightly elevated as stay-at-home trends remain, while C&I usage improves throughout the year, returning to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.  
In the East, we see similar trends, although we believe C&I recovery to be pre-pandemic levels could take an additional 12 to 18 months given stronger stay-at-home trends.  
Now as it relates to NRG, we continue to see strong residential load across all markets, and we expect to be a relative winner given our multi-brand and multichannel platform.  
In ERCOT, we're seeing lower attrition rates, and incremental growth opportunities through our multichannel approach and flight to quality following Uri.  
In the East, we're also realizing lower attrition. But given the less favorable regulatory framework, we depend more on face-to-face sales to win customers.  
For planning purposes, we are assuming normal customer growth in ERCOT and a slight contraction in the East as it more closely tracks the economic reopenings. On retail supply cost, we see a little risk of sustained high prices this summer, given robust summer reserve margins across all our core markets.  
While it is still early, we're eager for the earlier evolution and implementation of the Biden infrastructure plan. As we believe it will amplify the electrification of the economy through smart technology and cleaner energy choices.  
So with this positive backdrop, we continue to make good progress in executing our customer-centric strategy, as you can see on Slide 8.  
On the Direct Energy integration, this transaction presented a step change for us as we move closer to the customer by significantly expanding our customer network and home services.  
During the first quarter, we achieved $51 million or 38% of our 2021 synergy target. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve both the 2021 and full plan targets, and we plan to update this scorecard quarterly in order to provide transparency and keep you informed of our progress.  
We are on track to close on the 4.8 gigawatt asset sale in the fourth quarter. This is a good transaction for us as it further streamlines our business and address terminal value and earnings concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth.  
Our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress.  
Finally, we are preparing for our Investor Day. We continue to target late spring, and given the flexibility afforded by the virtual format, we will announce the event 2 or 3 weeks prior to best manage around the Texas resolution.  
So with that, I will pass it to Gaetan for the financial review."

I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the first quarter results and Uri's financial impact. On the upper left side of the slide, we have shown our quarterly results and reinstated guidance after excluding the onetime impact of",924,"Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the first quarter results and Uri's financial impact. 
On the upper left side of the slide, we have shown our quarterly results and reinstated guidance after excluding the onetime impact of winter storm Uri, which we are showing separately on the right. As mentioned by Mauricio, we believe that this better reflects the recurring earnings power of our business following the acquisition of Direct Energy, and it is consistent with our established practice of excluding extraordinary events. 
For the quarter, NRG delivered $567 million in adjusted EBITDA or $218 million higher than the first quarter of last year, excluding $967 million impact from winter storm Uri. 
This increase is driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy, which generates approximately 2/3 of its EBITDA during the winter months, given the seasonal shape of East electric and natural gas load. This seasonality will help flatten NRG's future earnings profile throughout the year. Specific to Direct Energy, we are on track to realize $500 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021. We are also on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 as well with $51 million realized in the first quarter, and a goal of at least $300 million annual run rate by 2023. 
Turning now your attention to the table on the right, the total anticipated growth impact from winter storm Uri is now $975 million. The increase since our last communication is primarily driven by the 55-day resettlement information from ERCOT, which affected our uplift cost and load estimates and added some incremental results for counterparty credit risk, all of which were partially offset by discounting the ERCOT default charges. 
We continue to pursue various offselling solution estimated to be in the range of $275 million to $475 million. This would reduce the economic impact to a net amount of $500 million to $700 million. 
From a cash standpoint, based on $150 million of estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers in 2022, the total negative cash impact in 2021 is expected to be approximately $150 million lower at $350 million to $550 million, including the effect of the offsets previously mentioned. 
Finally, we are reinstating our 2021 guidance at the original ranges of $2.4 to $2.6 billion for our adjusted EBITDA and $144 billion to $164 billion for our free cash flow before growth. 
I will now turn to Slide 11, where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation.  Changes on this slide from last quarter are indicated in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was reduced by $38 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustment. 
Moving on to the next column. The estimated winter storm Uri capital allocation impact is $825 million, net of anticipated customer bill credit outstanding at the end of the year, and would be at $450 million after deducting the midpoint of our estimated mitigation efforts of $375 million. 
This has reduced our original deleveraging plan in 2021. However, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving our credit metrics over time. Absent any mitigation offset recoveries, which are shown in the far right of the chart, the company will still pay down debt by $385 million in 2021 and continue to delever over time to meet its credit profile goals. 
Importantly, this does not include any deleveraging associated with the sale of our East and West assets, which is still slated to close later this year. 
Moving on to Slide 12. I will start on the left with our 2021 credit metrics. After adjusting our corporate debt balance for the reduction from our 2021 capital allocation and minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.8 billion. This, when based on the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA, implies a ratio of just under 3x to  adjusted EBITDA at the end of the year. This notably excludes the onetime impact of winter Storm Uri, which we also expect to be excluded by the rating agencies. 
On the topic of raining, we continue to work with the agencies to review winter Storm Uri's impact on the time line and the requirements to achieve investment grade. We remain committed to strong credit metrics and continue to operate under the assumption that investment-grade ratings will be awarded shortly after achieving the targeted metrics. But we're not controlling this process. And we realized that given the circumstances, it could take the agencies much longer than previously anticipated to be comfortable granting us an IG rating. 
I would note that if the timeline is extended, it could also give us an opportunity to achieve our metrics either through debt reduction and/or EBITDA growth. 
Turning to the right side of the slide. We also wanted to update you on our latest liquidity position, which are -- which had $4.1 billion as of a few days ago, remains very strong and sufficient to continue supporting our business even during a period of stress. 
In conclusion, we are reinstating our EBITDA and free cash flow before growth to the original guidance provided in the last earnings call, excluding the impact of winter Storm Uri. 
While the storm has impacted our capital allocation plan, we have maintained a strong liquidity position before, during and after the event, what our core business continues to perform as otherwise expected. 
With this, I will hand it back to Mauricio."

I recognize that winter Storm Uri has impacted investor confidence in ERCOT's market design and the durability of our cash flow. 
But I want to be clear. Given the steps being discussed in the Texas legislature and the actions by market participants, I don't believe an event like this can happen again. 
The systemic failure was the result of a lack of winter stress planning, which was then amplified by poor electric and natural gas coordination and protocols to orderly restore the energy system and communicate with customers. 
Energy is a key pillar to Texas outsized growth and all stakeholders are focused on addressing winter reliability swiftly and comprehensively. ERCOT's winter planning parameters will be enhanced. Grid coordination will be improved and protocols for a large-scale emergency will be established. 
Now finally, today, following our extensive CFO search, I am pleased to announce that Alberto Fornaro will join our team as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective June 1. 
Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. Alberto joins us from Coupang, the world's fifth largest e-commerce platform, where he served as Group Chief Financial Officer and Senior Advisor. 
Before that, he served as CFO for public and private companies, including International Game Technology, a leading gaming company; Doosan, compact and heavy construction equipment company; and Technogym, the world's second largest manufacturer of fitness equipment. 
I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal fit to enhance our decisive move closer to the customer. 
I also want to take a moment to recognize Gaetan Frotte for stepping in as interim CFO and leading the finance organization during this challenging time. Gaetan is a very important and valuable member of our leadership team. 
On behalf of everyone at NRG, thank you, Gaetan, for your leadership and dedication. 
So with that, Daphne, we'll open the line for questions."

I think the legislature recognizes that they are prioritizing how they move through these different buckets of, let's call it, buckets of cost. There are a number of bills that are addressing securitization, specifically right now for co-ops and ERCOT defaults, also including some ancillary services and uplift.

The way to think about it is all of the cost of goods sold portion of that $975 million has been sold by now. All of the gas settlement and all of those things have been done. 
But obviously, on the working capital side, some of the receivables have been issued, the billing has been issued, but the cash hasn't been paid yet, and you will probably have noticed at the end of the first quarter that we had a large receivable balance. But then in our liquidity numbers as of a few days ago, our liquidity has gone up significantly, which shows the collection that we've enjoyed during the month of April. So this is the second moving piece. 
And then the last moving piece is the one we highlighted on Page 10, which is the deferred credits. And we've estimate this to be $150 million for 2021 with an impact basically deferred into 2022. So those are the main moving pieces here around the cash. You should assume that based on those, the cash impact for us, for the first quarter is below the $975 million, basically.

I mean, if you recall, we've been running a dual headquarters for now for quite some time. And I think in the spirit of simplifying our business operations and also as part of the Direct Energy integration, this was already on the works for quite some time. Obviously, the winter storm Uri impacted the timing of the announcement. 
But I think from a -- just from a simplification and cost optimization standpoint, this is really -- this was all part of our plan. I think one thing that is important to note is, as we're thinking about the return to the office, we all appreciate that remote work is going to be more prevalent in the future, and we've gotten very comfortable with that.  We've been running our company in a very efficient way. 
So I would expect that as we reimagine the workspace of the future, that hybrid and remote work will be more prevalent. And we actually have inside the organization something that I call Workplace 21, which is really a group of a committee that is thinking through our real estate needs, what are we going to do in terms of which employees need to work remote, hybrid, in person in the office? How do we think about maintaining the culture of the company through this new way of working? How do we extend some of our corporate values like safety and well-being beyond the offices and into homes? 
So I mean, this is very comprehensive. We, as a company, are going to be flexible with our employee. We recognize that in order to attract the best talent, we have to keep up with technology and the means by which our employees are more fulfilled and satisfied. 
So I'm very pleased with the move. I think, as I said on my remarks, I mean, Houston is an incredible city in terms of leading the energy transformation, in terms of technology. They have a very diverse workforce. Many of our customers or the majority of our customers already reside in Texas. Many of our employees are already there. So I think this is just formalizing something that really has been happening now for quite some time."

I'm joined this morning by Gaetan Frotte, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.  
I'd like to start this call by expressing our utmost concern for the millions of Texans impacted by winter storm Uri. We're actively working in our communities and with our customers to provide support and relief to those in need. I also want to recognize all the men and women from NRG who, under frigid conditions, were working tirelessly to keep our power plants running and those employees who work day and night through this event to inform and support our customers, all while facing their own hardship at home. From everyone at NRG, thank you.  
Let's move on to Slide 3 for the 3 key messages of the call. First, above all else, our top priority and core focus today is helping our Texas communities recover from the devastating winter storm. The system-wide energy failure that occurred in Texas is unacceptable, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to prevent this from happening again.  Next, our integrated platform continues to deliver stable results through unprecedented events like the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events, further validating the strength of our model. 
Finally, we continue to advance our customer-centric strategy by redefining our platform to better serve our customers. In January, we closed on the Direct Energy transaction, forming the leading North American integrated energy and home services company, now serving a network of 6 million customers. Today, we are announcing the sale of a 4.8 gigawatt portfolio of noncore fossil assets, which I will detail later in the presentation.  
Turning to Slide 4. Starting on the left-hand side, winter storm Uri was simply historic. It was the third coldest 3-day stretch on record in Texas, blanketing the state for days with record cold temperatures and precipitation, putting unprecedented stress on the entire energy system. This winter storm exceeded all planning parameters and highlighted the interdependency between the natural gas and power systems. On adjusted estimated peak low of 77 gigawatts surpassing not just the winter peak, but the all-time peak. And due to weather-related system and plant-specific issues, 52 gigawatts of capacity in the market were forced off-line at one time or another. 
Last week, we committed to work with regulators and legislators on a comprehensive and exhaustive root cause analysis of what went wrong in the energy system, from fuel supply to the production and delivery of electricity. Our goal is to have a system that is more resilient to prevent this from happening again.  
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide. Our work to prepare for winter conditions began well before the onset of frigid temperatures. As part of our winter readiness program, we execute a comprehensive winterization program that starts with the lessons learned from prior winter seasons. Then every September, our power plants in each of our markets, including Texas, begin a well-defined process of preparing for winter operations. The results are presented to me in early November by the Head of Operations and each plant manager. We then submit our declaration of completion of the winter weatherization preparations to ERCOT and the PUCT by November 30.  
In early February, we recognized the threat of this significant winter storm. Safety of our employees, customers and communities is always our top priority. For our customers, we send cold weather alerts and energy conservation notifications across all of our retail brands and work with our large C&I customers to proactively reduce their load. For our generation fleet, we put all plants at the highest level of alert, made all operational units available to the market and secured additional critical supplies at our sites. This included moving personnel from the Northeast with extreme cold weather experience and technical expertise to Texas plants.  
Ahead of the storm, we also took additional steps of increasing our available generation capacity by bringing back nearly 2 gigawatts of power generation typically reserve only for summer months. We also executed additional natural gas and power hedges. Our available generation portfolio performed at roughly 80% capacity factor on average. When comparing our generation production to a similar period earlier in the month, we produced almost twice as much electricity. Despite our best efforts to winterize the fleet, we suffered our share of unit-specific and system-related problems that will be part of our root cause analysis.  
Turning to Slide 5. Our strategy is to maintain a balanced portfolio between retail load and supply to protect both our customers and our business. In Texas, we have a significant retail footprint across the state, supported by diverse generation assets and third-party agreements. 
During the storm, we aimed at maximizing the output of our power plants while maintaining a fairly balanced position across the portfolio.  Importantly, none of our residential customers will be exposed to the real-time wholesale power prices that occurred during the storm. We don't offer these products to our residential customers, and we also don't believe they should be available to them. And like I said earlier, we're focused on recovery efforts across our communities. We have pledged an initial $10 million in relief to our communities, customers and employees.  
Now turning to the right side of the slide. We expect our balanced platform to deliver stable results. Our preliminary analysis of the winter storm financial impact is expected to be within our current guidance range. This preliminary assessment incorporates internal estimates on customer meter and settlement data, which have not been finalized yet. It also makes assumption on potential customer and counterparty credit risk and ERCOT-default allocations. We have also performed a stress test on our assumptions resulting in a potential outcome, although at a lower probability of plus/minus $100 million to our guidance ranges. As information becomes available, we'll be able to narrow this kind of outcomes.  
Moving to the 2020 operational and financial highlights on Slide 6. Beginning with our 2020 scorecard, we executed on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results and had our best safety year ever. I want to take a moment to thank and commend all of my colleagues as this is now the third straight year we set a new record for safety, an incredible accomplishment. 
Our 3-year transformation plan goals were fully achieved in 2020. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, achieved a strong balance sheet, established a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation.  
Over the last 5 years, we have been evolving our platform to move closer to the customer. In 2020, we took major steps towards this goal with key highlights, including the acquisition of Direct Energy, and diversifying our supply strategy through signing renewable PPAs in ERCOT and launching RFPs in the East. We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio by growing retail and reducing generation. I look forward to sharing with you the next chapter during our Spring Analyst Day.  
Now moving to the financial results on the right-hand side of the slide. We delivered $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range; and $1.547 billion of free cash flow before growth, which includes the pulling forward of certain items from 2021 into 2020 in order to fund the Direct Energy acquisition. Gaetan will provide more detail on the free cash flow later in the presentation.  
I want to note that our 2020 carbon emissions came in below our 2025 50% reduction goal. We're not adjusting our 2025 targets today, but this highlights our efforts in reducing carbon emissions. Finally, as I previously stated, we're maintaining our guidance ranges for 2021.  
Turning to Slide 7. I want to provide an update on the Direct Energy integration. This transaction presented a step change for us as we move closer to the customer by significantly expanding our customer network and home services. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, it also provides a significant opportunity to leverage our operating platform and achieve significant synergies. This transaction advanced our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure.  
With Direct Energy closed, NRG now have the strongest collection of competitive power brands, offering energy products and services in North America. The Direct Energy acquisition significantly expands our residential and business footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas. Both residential and business customers are able to leverage our platforms for solutions that feed their specific needs, elevating consumer choice to a whole new level.  
Our integration efforts are well underway. And today, we are reaffirming the planned targets. We're already making significant progress on talent assessment, collateral management and systems integration. Throughout this integration process, we are focused on high grading our organization through retaining the best and diverse talent and further deepening our customer-focused culture. The integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan and has a similar governance structure. I am highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergies outlined on the slide.  
On the right-hand side of the slide, you will see a scorecard that looks familiar and that is because it is how we reported our transformation plan progress to all of you. We plan to update this scorecard with our results in order to provide transparency and keep you informed of our progress.  
Next, turning to Slide 8 for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. I highlighted last quarter that we were actively focused on monetizing noncore assets with a target to realize a minimum of $250 million in equity proceeds within 6 to 12 months. I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, to sell a 4.8-gigawatt portfolio of fossil fuel assets across New York, Connecticut and California for $760 million in cash proceeds or roughly 4x EBITDA.  
As you can see on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, many of these assets are nearing end of life and with economics dependent upon capacity markets. Excluding Sunrise, the average expected capacity factors ranges between 0% to 6%. This is a good transaction for us. It further streamlines our business and addresses terminal value and earnings concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth. Our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. The asset sale is targeted to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net cash proceeds after associated debt reduction will be allocated using our capital allocation framework.  
Before turning over the call to Gaetan for the financial review, I want to thank Kirk Andrews for his decade of service at NRG. Over the last 10 years, Kirk has not only been a colleague, but also a trusted friend. And I believe I speak for the entire organization when I say that we all wish him well and the best in his future endeavors. Our finance team is in capable hands with Gaetan Frotte, our Treasurer, stepping in as Interim CFO. 
With that, I will pass it over to Gaetan for the financial review."
413857,702919268,2287858,"NRG Energy, Inc., 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2021",2021-03-01,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the full year results and our 2021 guidance. Last year, NRG delivered slightly more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. So our adjusted",1059,"Thank you, Mauricio. I will now turn to Slide 10 for a review of the full year results and our 2021 guidance. Last year, NRG delivered slightly more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $1.5 billion in free cash flow before growth. So our adjusted EBITDA for the year is in line with our 2020 guidance, and I would note that it includes the impact of COVID-19 that came in at only $25 million or half of our original cost expectations.  
Moving to free cash flow before growth. Year-end results are $47 million higher than our latest midpoint of guidance driven by the inclusion of $43 million in distribution from Agua Caliente in 2020, just prior to the sale of the project in early February. 
Finally, from a balance sheet standpoint, 2020 was also very successful with a year-end leverage close to 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which is at the strongest end of our targeted range. In addition, we had over $7 billion of liquidity accumulated in anticipation of the acquisition of Direct Energy in early January. A portion of that liquidity proved very useful during the recent winter storm.  
Moving to 2021 guidance. As included in the closing announcement for Direct Energy, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and our 2021 free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion. As mentioned by Mauricio before, we are maintaining our guidance range for 2021 based on our preliminary analysis of the impact of the winter storm Uri on our results.  
Based on a stress analysis, we believe that the financial impact on the guidance range could vary by plus or minus $100 million, subject to final customer meter and settlement data, counterparty credit risk and expected ERCOT-default allocation. 
Finally, we have signed a PSA to sell 4.8 gigawatt of generation assets in our East-West region to an affiliate of ArcLight for $760 million, and we anticipate closing to occur by the end of the year. These assets contribute approximately $190 million of adjusted EBITDA and approximately $130 million of free cash flow before growth to NRG. I would note that these numbers have not been yet deducted from our guidance range.  
Turning to the sources and uses for Direct Energy on Slide 11. We wanted to provide a bridge between the numbers reported during our last earnings call in early November when we discussed eliminating the need for $750 million of preferred equity and the actual results after closing the acquisition last January. So starting from the left with the $3.745 billion of total sources and uses as discussed last quarter, we first lowered NRG cash by $100 million to reflect the lower cash reserves available at year-end as shown on Slide 22 of the appendix. This was offset with an equivalent temporary growth under the revolver at closing.  
Next, we used $13 million of incremental financing cost savings minus $2 million of initial discount on our bond issuance to reduce the temporary draw under the revolver by $11 million. In the next column, we reflected $77 million for a purchase price adjustment that was paid to Centrica due in part to the larger cash balance available at Direct Energy when we acquired the company. This was also financed through a temporary draw under our revolver.  
Finally, we show the impact from acquired cash and margin collateral. Since at closing, Direct Energy had $233 million in cash margin posted and $152 million of cash and cash equivalents for a total of $385 million of cash on its -- and equivalents on its balance sheet. This was higher than we had anticipated last quarter, and we were able to use it after closing to repay the $160 million temporary draw under the revolver and reduced the NRG cash allocated to the acquisition by $219 million. More importantly, it also means more cash is available for deleveraging in 2021, which eliminates the need to use future asset sale proceeds to achieve our investment-grade credit metrics by year-end.  
I will now turn to Slide 12 where we are updating the combined 2021 capital allocation provided last quarter. Please note that changes on this slide are indicated in blue. Starting from the left, we have adjusted the 2021 excess cash to reflect the final $715 million of CAFA reserve at the end of 2020. The $1.54 billion updated free cash flow before growth, including Direct Energy, based on the midpoint of our guidance range and finally, the $120 million of net proceeds from the sale of our remaining equity stake in Agua Caliente, all these represent a total of $2.375 billion available.  
Then moving on to the next change on the third column. We updated the capital allocated to the Direct acquisition, which is now at $496 million, as shown on the previous slide. Finally, given the reduced cash needs for the acquisition, we are allocating our additional excess cash of $219 million to debt reduction. This brings our total debt reduction to nearly $1.2 billion, bringing us to within our targeted investment-grade metrics in 2021 and importantly, without the need for asset sale proceeds that we had mentioned before. 
Finally, on Slide 13, I will start on the left with our 2021 credit metrics, which is now based on our finalized plan shown in the middle column. After adjusting our corporate balance for the increased debt reduction from 2021 capital allocation, our 2021 net debt balance is approximately $7 billion, which, based on the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA, implies a pro forma ratio of 2.65x net debt to EBITDA, well within the range of our targeted investment-grade metrics. 
Turning to the right. We also wanted to update you on our strong liquidity position at the end of last week, which at $3.8 billion, is ample enough to continue supporting our business even during periods of stress like we experienced over the last 2 weeks. 
In conclusion, and as discussed earlier, after proving the resilient performance of our integrated model during these trying times for Texas and our capital allocation plan to achieve investment-grade credit metrics by the end of 2021, we continue to believe in our ability to reach investment-grade ratings by the end of 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ] or early 2022. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

That's already within the guidance that we're maintaining. Now having said that, we know that we only have preliminary information on customer meter and settlement data. We are stress testing the counterparty risk and also the expected ERCOT-default allocations. So once we did that stress test, that's why we are putting this plus/minus $100 million, which I think is prudent given the -- just the preliminary nature of these 3 key components of it."

So I think that process is going to take some time, and the first steps already happened last week. I mean I think everybody has seen the hearings down in Austin. I had the opportunity to participate. And that to me, it is the prudent first step. 
Having spent some time down there and just looking comprehensively at the -- at what happened, I will say that there is perhaps 3 themes that legislatures and other stakeholders will be looking at. First is the hardening of the energy system from natural gas to power generation. I think it is clear that when the power generation is made up of close to 50% of the total capacity fueled by natural gas, natural gas -- the natural gas system becomes critical, and it needs to be hardened just as rigorous as the power generation system. 
The second thing, I think there is going to be a conversation around the market design. And the focus, from my perspective, should be around the reserve margins and what is the excess capacity that we want to have in the ERCOT system to make sure that this doesn't happen again with perhaps more extreme weather conditions than in the past. And I think part of this excess capacity is not just the quantity of capacity, but also the quality of capacity. And what I mean about the quality, it is fuel diversification. 
And then I think, finally, it is the communications. And to me, it is clear that communications needed to be a lot more than what we experienced last week. First is the communication between the power and the natural gas systems and the coordination between the 2. Second, it is the communication between TDUs who were responsible of implementing the power outages directed by ERCOT, and the reps who have the relationship with the customer. I mean I think that communication is to be a lot stronger. And we need to evaluate and assess a -- perhaps an alert system that tells our communities when something like this is going to happen and the potential risk. And then finally, I just -- I think it is important that we recognize just the magnitude of this winter storm. I mean any way you see it, it was historic. And as we are assessing these 3 things, particularly the hardening, we just need to make sure that is that the -- are we rebaselining our winterization efforts with this 100-year winter storm that we all live. 
So that would be my initial comments, Steve. Obviously, I mean we're only in the beginning phase of this, but -- and I think we need to -- I think all the parties from what I can gather in my time in Austin, they want to take their time to make sure that they really fully understand what caused it so they can be thorough and have changes that will be effective and long lasting."

I think I said it in the past that generation, the portfolio of generation that we have has to help us better serve our customers. So when you take a step back, obviously, owning physical generation, it is important. But we can get some of the characteristics of physical generation through bilateral agreements. It doesn't -- we don't have to own it all the time or always to be able to have those characteristics. We can actually structure some of those agreements, so we can benefit and utilize these -- the characteristics of physical generation. 
I will say that the strength that we all saw in the system last week is giving us already lessons learned on how we should be thinking about counterparty performance, counterparty risk. And the team is already looking at the lessons learned on our commercial team, which, by the way, I just want to give a big kudos to both commercial operations and plant operations because they absolutely maximized the amount of generation that we were giving to the system and, at the same time, maintaining the stability and the balance on our portfolio. 
So that's how I think about it, Steve. And obviously, our matching of generation and retail is always informed by market conditions. So it's not like set it and forget it."

We -- as we were approaching the storm, the commercial team took the necessary steps to strengthen our position going into the storm both on natural gas and power hedges. In addition to that, our plant operations people brought in almost 2,000 megawatts of generation that normally, in most of the circumstances, never run in the winter and we actually have it reserved for summer operations. So that's another testament of strengthening our position as we go into the storm. 
And then as you were looking at -- as you look at our load obligations across the state, it's pretty well diversified between Houston and Dallas and the north. So I think it was a good, good solid execution with the right foundation in terms of the integrated portfolio and the necessary steps to get ready for it. 
So Chris, is there something more that you want to add?"

If you look at it, our strategy is to have a mix of physical gen and market purchases. And notwithstanding the problems we face, frankly, on both sides, right, with unit outages and then counterparty issues that we're working through, this strategy of diversified supply seems to have held together pretty well. 
As we saw the forecast get colder and colder, we brought more generation, like Mauricio mentioned, not a seasonal layup, and we bought more power from the market. Like let's be clear, we were prepping to cover loads in the high 60s and low 70s, you know what I mean, in terms of thousands of megawatts load. We were also, don't forget, able to use our gas storage and transportation contracts and our ability to find and buy what I will politely describe as obscenely expensive gas in order to keep those gas units of ours producing the megawatts that the grid needed. I know that not everybody was able to do that, but the combination of our contracts and working out in the market, we were able to cover it. 
So that is kind of how the whole thing worked out to where we think we're still within the guidance range, plus or minus the $100 million. So I would say our strategy of a mix, a bunch of different stuff paid off."

And I was very clear, the hardening of the system cannot only happen on the power generation side, it has to happen also on the natural gas system. I mean when 45% of our total generation capacity in Texas is fueled by natural gas, they're completely interdependent. And so that interdependency, it needs to be expanded when we're thinking about the hardening of the system, the winterization of the system. 
The second thing is the communications. Obviously, there needs to be a lot more coordination between natural gas and power. And just like we talk about fuel diversification on power generation, we need to be thinking about redundancy on critical parts of the gas system like compressor stations. Does it make sense to have a back-up generation? What are the standards for winterization at the wellhead? I mean there is a number of things that can happen on the gas system side. And that will also -- we need to review the winterization protocols on the power generation side. 
I mean the last time there was a recommendation was in 2011, and the wind -- the storm in 2011, I mean I have this stat that I think puts things in perspective. The 3-day stretch temperature, this winter storm I think ranks as the third coldest in the last 130 years. 2011 was the 60th. So I think that should give you a pretty good context in terms of what was the baseline that was used for the winterization of the power generation. And I think there's going to be a conversation about rebaselining that. So some of that is going to happen. 
And I think it has to be also beyond power generation. It has to be around the customer and the communications with the customer. I mean when you're talking about power outages and rolling power outages, first, you need to make sure that you communicate with the customers. The TDUs are responsible for implementing these load shares at the direction of ERCOT that is balancing the system. And so do we need to review the protocol in terms of how that is implemented, what is the communication protocol between the transmission and distribution utilities and the retail energy providers that have the relationship with the customer. So all of these things are going to have to be taken into consideration. And I think I have to say, I mean the Texas legislature is really doing the right thing in terms of doing this exhaustive and comprehensive root cause analysis."

Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results. 
Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges. 
Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improved grid reliability. The public utility and railroad commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues. 
Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, a road map until 2025 and a compelling value proposition of our consumer platform. 
Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved of decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people. 
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities. 
Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section. 
Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engage in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that fail and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focus on reliability from the wellhead to the LIPO. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and [indiscernible] to get it done right. 
The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system. Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. 
We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and modernization this year for the power sector. 
Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature will recognize the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like [indiscernible] Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year. 
Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million, primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio. 
Next, our previously announced 4.8 gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation, doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders. 
The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantage consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match. 
Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing areas. As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.
As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual fuel customer base. 
Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders. 
To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services. 
Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map. 
Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly half a billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year, applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework, resulting $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth. We have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million of incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases. 
In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favor brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer tenure customers. 
We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders, and we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders. 
So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal feed to enhance our transition into a consumer services company. Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review."

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company. 
Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future. 
Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2. Specifically by region, these benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues. 
Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown. 
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end. 
Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million, with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter. 
The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits on to large commercial and industrial customers. 
Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by [ 2023 ]. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021, with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actions. 
Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth. 
I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter. 
Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislature. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization bills HB4492 and SB1580 have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year. 
Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million, plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $264 million of capital to be allocated. This leads $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes. 
Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8 gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation. 
Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023, primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices, whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices. These tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else. 
I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of our diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable.

So yes, we're in a bit of an up cycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see, and we're covering it if it offers as they happen or off of our generation. We're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our Mary way. So I think Mauricio is right, the integrated platform is a great way to play, whether it's an up cycle or a down cycle."

That's the least path of resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling. 
And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly. But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited.

But there will be weather events, summer and winter down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG.

Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of the products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point. 
The second point is we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually bind the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things. 
I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own one big power plant, and you will basically say, okay, well, now they're not sure, that being -- that one power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri. So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial digital team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we can. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees off our cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better. So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view."

And again, I did hear, Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys have not short power. So I understand that, at least in the in the long term.

I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that doesn't create any exposure. 
Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month and whether or not we cannot -- but keep in mind, I mean, a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying we have the ability to pass through some of these costs. And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, each of these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power. I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's all or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same. 
So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions, and that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure. 
And on the fixed price, we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers."

So I mean I'm really glad to see that you will be restarting your share buyback program. Now is that in any way implicitly stating that your investment-grade rating is sort of delayed inherently given the Uri storm? And as such, there is no point in trying to delever as quickly as possible, hence, have some more flexibility? Because, again, I would have expected that you're going to try to go back, say, 2.5 to 2 75 quickly as possible, and clearly, buybacks are not going to help with this."

We changed just the trajectory on how to get there, and that was informed by our conversations with rating agencies in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri. So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies. 
I don't control the credit ratings timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2 75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you. So that's how I expect to start allocating this excess cash, which includes share buybacks towards the end of the year when we start having some excess cash, but I mean that's going to be contingent on when do we close the asset sale and when do we start seeing the money from the Uri mitigants."

Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  
Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  
Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  
Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  
Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities. 
Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section.  
Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the need to get it done right.  
The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system. 
Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and modernization this year for the power sector. 
Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  
Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio. 
Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter.  
Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation: doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  
The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. 
With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match.  Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones. 
As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  
As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base.  Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders.  
To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  
Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  
Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework, resulting $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth, we have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases.  
In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favor brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers.  We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  
So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal feed to enhance our transition into a consumer services company. 
Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review."

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  
Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future. 
Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2. 
Specifically, by region, these benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues. 
Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  
Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter.  The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits on to large commercial and industrial customers.  
Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  
Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  
I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter. 
Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year.  
Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $2,264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  
Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation. 
Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else. 
I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business is somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices. 
Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio."

So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way. 
So I think Mauricio is right. The integrated platform is a great way to play this, whether it's an upcycle or downcycle."

That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling. 
And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly. 
But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited.

But there will be weather events, summer and winter, down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. The Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG. So how do you plan on changing your disclosure going forward about your long or short position as a mix of contracting physical assets and other hedging?"

Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  
The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually bind the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things. 
I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, ""Okay. Well, now they're not short."" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri. 
So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees off our cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better. 
So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view."

And again, I did hear Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys are not short power. So I understand that at least in the long term. But how can you reconcile the movement in forward power curves and the fact that you are relying on market-based purchases of power on your medium-term margins on the retail side?

And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that doesn't create any exposure. 
Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs. 
And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, each is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power. 
I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same.  So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  
And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers."

Now is that in any way implicitly stating that your investment-grade rating is sort of delayed inherently given the Uri storm? And as such, there is no point in trying to delever as quickly as possible, hence, you have some more flexibility? Because, again, I would have expected that you're going to try to go back to that, say, 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA as quickly as possible. And clearly, buybacks are not going to help with this."

We haven't changed our targets of investment-grade credit metrics. We changed just the trajectory on how to get there. And that was informed by our conversations with rating agencies in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri. 
So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies.  I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you. 
So that's how I expect to start allocating this excess cash, which includes share buybacks towards the end of the year when we start having some excess cash, but I mean that's going to be contingent on when do we close the asset sale and when do we start seeing the money from the Uri mitigants."

Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  
Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  
Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  
Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  
Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities. 
Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section.  
Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the mandate to get it done right.  
The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system. 
Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and weatherization this year for the power sector. 
Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  
Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio. 
Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter.  
Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation: doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  
The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. 
With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match.  Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones. 
As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  
As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base.  Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders.  
To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  
Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  
Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework results in $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth. We have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases.  
In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favored brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers.  We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  
So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal fit to enhance our transition into a consumer services company. 
Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review."

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  
Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future. 
Moving to the quarterly results, I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2. 
Specifically, by region, the East benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues. 
Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  
Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter.  The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers.  
Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  
Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  
I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter. 
Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year.  
Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  
Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation. 
Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else. 
I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business as somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices. 
Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio."

So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way.

And actually, we have already started a number of initiatives both on power services and home services. But as I said, I mean our #1 priority right now, and I want to be unequivocal about it, is integrating Direct Energy and achieving the $300 million of synergies. That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling. 
And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly. 
But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited.  We actually have a pilot program right now on home solar, which is very exciting, and we're learning a lot about what customers want. So we are waiting -- we're not waiting. We're starting these initiatives. We're very small, deploying very little capital, and -- but we're learning a whole lot."

But there will be weather events, summer and winter, down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. The Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG. So how do you plan on changing your disclosure going forward about your long or short position as a mix of contracting physical assets and other hedging?"

Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  
The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually buy in the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things. 
I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, ""Okay. Well, now they're not short."" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri. 
So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees up cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better. 
So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view."

And again, I did hear Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys are not short power. So I understand that at least in the long term. But how can you reconcile the movement in forward power curves and the fact that you are relying on market-based purchases of power on your medium-term margins on the retail side?

And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that -- that doesn't create any exposure. 
Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs. 
And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power. 
I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same.  So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  
And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers."

So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies.  I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you. 
So that's how I expect to start allocating this excess cash, which includes share buybacks towards the end of the year when we start having some excess cash, but I mean that's going to be contingent on when do we close the asset sale and when do we start seeing the money from the Uri mitigants."

Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  
Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  
Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  
Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  
Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities. 
Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section.  
Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the mandate to get it done right.  
The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system. 
Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and weatherization this year for the power sector. 
Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  
Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio. 
Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter.  
Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation: doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  
The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. 
With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match.  Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones. 
As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  
As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base.  Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders.  
To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  
Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  
Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework results in $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth. We have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases.  
In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favored brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers.  We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  
So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal fit to enhance our transition into a consumer services company. 
Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review."

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  
Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future. 
Moving to the quarterly results. I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2. 
Specifically, by region, the East benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues. 
Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  
Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter.  The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers.  
Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  
Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  
I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter. 
Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much-anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year.  
Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  
Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation. 
Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else. 
I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business as somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices. 
Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio."

So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way. 
So I think Mauricio is right. The integrated platform is a great way to play this, whether it's an upcycle or downcycle."

And actually, we have already started a number of initiatives both on power services and home services. But as I said, I mean our #1 priority right now, and I want to be unequivocal about it, is integrating Direct Energy and achieving the $300 million of synergies. That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling. 
And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly. 
But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited.  We actually have a pilot program right now on home solar, which is very exciting, and we're learning a lot about what customers want. So we are waiting -- we're not waiting. We're starting these initiatives. We're very small, deploying very little capital, and -- but we're learning a whole lot."

But there will be weather events, summer and winter, down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. The Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG. So how do you plan on changing your disclosure going forward about your long or short position as a mix of contracting physical assets and other hedging?"

Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  
The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually buy in the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things. 
I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, ""Okay. Well, now they're not short."" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri. 
So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees up cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better. 
So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view."

It seems to me at least that the business has become a bit of a black box for all of us. I don't think that we really appreciate some exposure to gas margins and hence, some increased seasonality of Direct Energy, especially. So we would definitely appreciate the disclosures.  
And again, I did hear Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys are not short power. So I understand that at least in the long term. But how can you reconcile the movement in forward power curves and the fact that you are relying on market-based purchases of power on your medium-term margins on the retail side? I mean I understand that you match your contracts with -- in the market purchases, but I don't think that that's -- it's possible to time it just right.

And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that -- that doesn't create any exposure. 
Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs. 
And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power. 
I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same.  So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  
And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed-price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers."

So I mean I'm really glad to see that you will be restarting your share buyback program. Now is that in any way implicitly stating that your investment-grade rating is sort of delayed inherently given the Uri storm? And as such, there is no point in trying to delever as quickly as possible, hence, you have some more flexibility? Because, again, I would have expected that you're going to try to go back to that, say, 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA as quickly as possible. And clearly, buybacks are not going to help with this."

So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies.  I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you.

Just a few weeks ago, we hosted our comprehensive Investor Day. Since then, we have had the opportunity to speak with many of you in detail about our strategic plan, which will position us as the leading energy consumer services company and create tremendous stakeholder value. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results.  
Turning to Slide 3. I would like to start with the 3 key messages for today's call. Our integrated platform delivered strong results during the second quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year. And today, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges.  
Next, following Winter Storm Uri, the Governor and Texas legislature acted swiftly to begin to address critical issues and improve grid reliability. The Public Utility and Railroad Commissions are now in the process of implementing these directives to strengthen both the electric and natural gas systems to improve reliability and protect customers. I want to thank the Governor and the Texas legislature for their leadership on these issues.  
Finally, in June, we held our Investor Day focused on our long-term strategic outlook, our road map through 2025 and the compelling value proposition of our consumer platform.  
Now moving to the financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 4, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. We again delivered top decile safety performance. This is the ninth straight quarter we have achieved top decile safety, an incredible accomplishment for the entire company. As we start to come back to the office, we will continue to adhere to the CDC guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.  
During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives with focus on integrating Direct Energy, advancing our capital-light decarbonization efforts and expanding our secondary product capabilities. 
Starting with the Direct Energy integration. Through the second quarter, we achieved $89 million in synergies or 2/3 of our 2021 target. Today, we're reaffirming both, the 2021 and full plan targets. Next, we continue to perfect our customer-centric model through advancing noncore asset sales and retirements and expanding our renewable PPA strategy across all of our markets. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We are reporting $656 million of adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter or 14% growth year-on-year and $1.223 billion or 33% growth year-to-date. Strong second quarter results were largely driven by the Direct Energy acquisition and favorable weather in the East, further demonstrating the value of our diversified platform of consumer services. Alberto will discuss in more detail the quarterly drivers in his section.  
Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our core markets, beginning on the left-hand side of the slide. Following Winter Storm Uri in February, it was clear that market reforms were necessary to improve grid resilience. In the months following the event, we actively engaged in discussions with legislators, regulators and other market participants to introduce comprehensive and competitive solutions across the entire system to address areas that failed and to ensure an event like this does not happen again. The Texas legislature acted swiftly in addressing these issues, passing Senate Bills 2 and 3, which were signed into law by the Governor on June 8, focused on reliability from the wellhead to the lightbulb. Importantly, Senate Bill 3 provides the Public Utility Commission, Railroad Commission and other parties the tools and the mandate to get it done right.  
The PUCT and ERCOT are now working to implement the power market portions of the reform. We are focused on supporting them in the implementation of these policies and procedures to ensure the market functions properly in the future. We expect the focus over coming months to be on improving price formation through mechanisms to incentivize reliability. It will also establish clear winterization and maintenance outage standards and protocols for the electric system. 
Importantly, the PUCT is focused on customer bills and ensuring these actions do not materially impact affordability, which has been a compelling attribute of living and doing business in Texas. We believe that PUCT will be able to address the key issues of market design, system hardening and weatherization this year for the power sector. 
Next, moving to the bottom left-hand side of the slide. The Governor and legislature recognized the financial harm of socializing the cost of defaults by regulated entities like Brazos and Rayburn across competitive markets. The legislation also addresses unhedgeable costs due to ERCOT's management of the grid, particularly during the final 32 hours of the event. The Texas legislature passed and the Governor signed into law necessary securitizations to address both default allocations and uplift charges. We expect to have greater line of sight on our costs eligible for securitization later this year.  
Finally, our expected net financial impact from Winter Storm Uri remains unchanged at $500 million to $700 million. From last quarter, our gross impact increased by $85 million primarily due to resettlements and bad debt, which we expect to be fully offset through our mitigation strategy. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide for an update on our ongoing portfolio and real estate optimization efforts. First, during the quarter, PJM held its first capacity auction in roughly 3 years, which provided disappointing results. Subsequently, given market conditions, we announced our intention to retire 1.6 gigawatts or 55% of our PJM coal generation by 2022 and the strategic review of our remaining PJM portfolio. 
Next, our previously announced 4.8-gigawatt asset sale remains on track to close in the fourth quarter.  
Finally, our portfolio repositioning and optimization is a continuous process. We are committed to our business model, and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Investor Day, beginning on Slide 6 with our strategy and platform. This was our first Investor Day since 2018. And in 3 short years, we underwent a significant transformation: doubling the number of customers we serve, optimizing our generation fleet to serve our customers, building an efficient operating platform and strengthening our balance sheet while returning significant excess cash to our shareholders.  
The acquisition of Direct Energy in January marked the next step in our journey as we completed the 3-year transformation plan and began our decisive transition into a consumer services company. While historically, our core product has been electricity, the addition of Direct Energy brought scale to our retail natural gas and services businesses. 
With consumers increasingly seeking a trusted partner to provide home solutions, our advantaged consumer platform is uniquely positioned to meet our customer needs in ways other providers cannot match.  Just yesterday, Green Mountain Energy filed an application to provide its 100 renewable electric product in Arizona. We're constantly on the lookout for new markets and to grow our service offering in existing ones. 
As we offer adjacent products and services, we can leverage our existing platform to access cost synergies. This economic advantage, coupled with better insights and more personalization, result in a better experience for our customers. For NRG, this advantage means broader insights into how consumers interact with their homes, additional margin and better retention on our core product. And then the cycle repeats as we grow, creating a more valuable business.  
As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided you a road map of our strategic priorities through 2025. Over the near term, our focus is on optimizing our core, which includes integrating Direct Energy, decarbonizing our retail supply and expanding our current dual-fuel customer base.  Next, beginning in 2022, our focus will shift to growing the core through residential power and home services. Finally, throughout this entire period, we will be returning significant capital to shareholders.  
To summarize our road map, we're starting with our foundation as a best-in-class integrated energy retailer. We will leverage our operating platform to become a trusted partner for power services, and then we will broaden our offerings and partnerships to become a provider of select home services.  
Finally, we have quantified for you what I believe is an achievable growth opportunity over the course of this strategic road map. In total, we have identified $720 million of incremental EBITDA growth opportunity, which will be achieved through the Direct Energy integration and the deployment of up to $2 billion of growth investments in both CapEx and OpEx opportunities. This capital will be deployed to the maximum return opportunity, and you can expect transparency as we begin to allocate investment dollars. Given our near-term focus on integrating Direct Energy and growing dual-fuel customers, you should expect this capital to be weighted towards the second half of our road map.  
Now turning to Slide 7. Over the course of our strategic road map, we expect to generate $8 billion in cumulative excess cash, which also excludes roughly $0.5 billion dollars of excess cash still to be allocated this year. Applying our 50-50 capital allocation framework results in $4 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $4 billion for opportunistic growth. We have earmarked $2 billion to achieve the $520 million incremental EBITDA detailed on the prior slide. The remaining $2 billion is available to be allocated to the maximum return opportunity, whether it be growth investments or share repurchases.  
In summary, we outlined a compelling value proposition, anchored by a portfolio of favored brands serving nearly 6 million customers. We are positioned to grow and leverage our existing operating platform to achieve higher margins and longer-tenure customers.  We have the financial flexibility to invest capital at attractive returns while returning significant capital to shareholders. And we have the right people and the right platform to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.  
So with that, I want to welcome Alberto Fornaro to the call and provide a brief introduction. Alberto joined NRG on June 1, following an extensive CFO search. Alberto is a seasoned finance expert who brings over 30 years of experience and a unique combination of consumer, technology, manufacturing and risk management experience. I believe Alberto's expertise is the ideal fit to enhance our transition into a consumer services company. 
Alberto, welcome, and I will turn it over to you for the financial review."

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.

I am excited to be with you this morning and to join NRG during its transformation to become a consumer services company.  
Now more than ever, customer experience and engagement are key priorities for leading companies, and I feel fortunate to be part of an organization that is completely focusing on the customer to continue to grow. I look forward to the dialogue with our analysts and investment community over the months to come. Hopefully, we will be able to meet in person sometime in the near future. 
Moving to the quarterly results. I will now turn to Slide 9 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $656 million in adjusted EBITDA or $82 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related addition of synergies achieved in Q2. 
Specifically, by region, the East benefited from the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. In addition, favorable weather resulted in outperformance by both our electric and natural gas businesses. Finally, we enjoyed favorable intra-year timing of demand response revenues. 
Next, our Texas region partially offset these benefits due to lower residential demand driven by milder weather and return-to-work trends as well as to higher retail supply costs. As a reminder, we benefited last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the start of the COVID-driven economic shutdown.  
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability was even more significant. It demonstrates the value of our diversified consumer services platform and its ability to absorb the possible impact of headwinds, such as the current forced outage we are dealing with at Limestone Unit 1, which will extend until year-end.  
Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with an $85 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants. This is primarily due to the positive development of the Texas securitization legislation during the quarter.  The total negative cash impact is still expected to be $350 million to $550 million in 2021 and $150 million in 2022 due to the estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers.  
Now turning to Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. We are on track to achieve $135 million of synergies for 2021 with $89 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectations as well as synergies achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals.  
Overall, we are off to a great start in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $1.44 billion to $1.64 billion for free cash flow before growth.  
I will now turn to Slide 10 where we are updating our planned 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left, on the third column, the net capital required for the Direct Energy acquisition was increased by $35 million based on the latest estimate of the post-closing working capital adjustments. We anticipate finalizing the working capital adjustments during the third quarter. 
Moving to the next column, and as discussed on the previous slide, the midpoint for net estimated cash impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $450 million. This includes the increase of $85 million for onetime costs in 2021 and similar increase in expected mitigants driven primarily by the latest Texas legislation. As you are aware, the much-anticipated securitization bills, HB4492 and SB1580, have been approved and are being finalized by ERCOT and PUCT. Clarity about the expected completion should come later this year.  
Moving to the next column. To achieve a 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, we expect to deleverage by $255 million plus early reduction fee of $9 million, totaling $264 million of capital to be allocated. This leaves $461 million of remaining capital available for allocation. A large portion of this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the ERCOT securitization processes.  
Finally, as a reminder, today, the capital allocation waterfall does not include the impact from our pending 4.8-gigawatt asset sale, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Net cash proceeds will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality and the remaining $100 million to $150 million after purchase price adjustments to be available for general capital allocation. 
Finally, on Slide 11. After reducing our corporate debt balance for the expected 2021 debt reimbursement and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of the adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio of 3.0 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As discussed during the Investor Day, given our growth profile, we have revised our time line to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We plan on achieving a stronger 3.0 ratio by year-end to 2021 and growing into our longer-term targets of 2.5 to 2.75 ratio by 2023 primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to achieve credit metrics aligned with an investment-grade rating. We are very comfortable in achieving our target and are continuing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

I mean as I tried to highlight in the past, our integrated platform really has reduced exposure to the underlying commodity prices. Whether it is increasing in natural gas, which we have seen or increasing in power prices, this tends to affect all market participants, all retail providers. So to some extent, all these increasing commodity prices can be passed through to customers. It's not that it's just affecting us or affecting somebody else. 
I will say that given the addition of the natural gas business with the acquisition of Direct Energy, that actually has been very complementary, and it highlights the strength of the diversified portfolio. I mean in the East, if you look at it, it's actually even more noticeable. If gas prices are increasing, perhaps that has some impact on -- in the near term on our power business, but it has actually a benefit on our natural gas business, which is incredibly sizable. So that's why I think investors need to think about our business as somewhat insulated from increases in commodity prices. 
Now I don't know, Chris, if you have any comments around just the direction of the price move and what to expect as I think I already addressed the impact on our portfolio."

So yes, we're in a bit of an upcycle right here. But like Mauricio said, it's something that we can price in, right? So if we're pricing to our customers off of the curves that we see and we're covering it off of the curves as they happen or off of our generation, we're in a good spot where we tack on the margin, move on our merry way. 
So I think Mauricio is right. The integrated platform is a great way to play this, whether it's an upcycle or downcycle."

That's the least path resistance to value, and we're focused on that. Then we're going to look at the low-hanging fruit opportunities like optimizing our dual-fuel customers. We have good visibility on them. We want our power customers to buy natural gas, and we want our natural gas customers to buy power. So the cost of acquisition is actually pretty compelling. 
And then -- and I think that would be the focus for the rest of 2021 and in 2022. You need to think about those opportunities on power and home services as we are testing and learning right now. And if we think that the opportunity is very attractive, then we will accelerate the scale up. If it's not, then we will kill it quickly. 
But I expect that most of that investment will happen in the second half of our planning period towards, let's say, '23 and beyond. But we're very, very excited.

I think everybody has seen the auction results. They were very disappointing. That basically resulted in the announcement of 50% of our coal fleet, the retirement -- the announced retirements of 50% of our coal fleet. I think given the changes in capacity prices in PJM, it's just prudent that we do a deep dive review of the rest of the portfolio.

First of all, the biggest investor concern about NRG is your short position in Texas, meaning the fact you don't have as much generation as you might have retail load. How do you anticipate changing your disclosures going forward to help get people comfortable with the short position, meaning whether you'll outline PPAs you have or tolling agreements or the hedging of future demand simply because -- while I doubt there's going to be another Uri, I'm not so -- I'm not a weatherman, so I can't predict it, but I kind of doubt it. 
But there will be weather events, summer and winter, down the road, maybe not as violent as Uri, but they'll happen. The Grid just a couple of weeks ago was actually forecasting one in Texas. And clearly, the short exposure is the single biggest risk outstanding for NRG. So how do you plan on changing your disclosure going forward about your long or short position as a mix of contracting physical assets and other hedging?"

Well, Michael, and let me just be clear here. NRG doesn't have a short position. When I talk about running an integrated model, every megawatt that we are selling to our customers, we're back to backing, whether it is with own generation or whether it is contracting generation in the market or just buying on the open wholesale market. So I want to be clear, Michael, because I think that is a misconception of NRG. We are not short electricity. We're not short of products that we're selling to our customers. We back-to-back them all. So that will be the first point.  
The second point is, we don't have to own every single megawatt that we have. I mean that is -- we can actually achieve the same attributes of owning generation by contracting them. We have a number of renewable PPAs that we have. We contract with other counterparties. And whether it is a tolling deal or some physical transaction, we can actually buy in the open market in the forwards. So I mean there is a number of things. 
I would say that the biggest lesson coming from Winter Storm Uri is the diversification of our supply. If I own 1 big power plant, and you will basically say, ""Okay. Well, now they're not short."" That big -- that 1 power plant will be a single point of failure. That's what we're trying to avoid. That was the big lesson from Winter Storm Uri. 
So I actually feel a lot more comfortable that we have a best-in-class commercial team that is looking at sourcing those megawatts from our power plants, from other people's power plants and from the open market. That is the best strategy that we have. And if we can do it in a capital-light way that frees up cash and maintains the strong free cash flow to EBITDA ratio that we have, the better. 
So that's how I think about it, Michael. But this notion that you're describing that somehow, the biggest risk is the short position of NRG, I just don't share that same view."

It seems to me at least that the business has become a bit of a black box for all of us. I don't think that we really appreciate some exposure to gas margins and hence, some increased seasonality of Direct Energy, especially. So we would definitely appreciate the disclosures.  
And again, I did hear Mauricio's comments about the fact that you guys are not short power. So I understand that at least in the long term. But how can you reconcile the movement in forward power curves and the fact that you are relying on market-based purchases of power on your medium-term margins on the retail side? I mean I understand that you match your contracts with -- in the market purchases, but I don't think that that's -- it's possible to time it just right.

And the customers that are on their fixed price, we back-to-back that. So the minute we sign a customer under fixed price, we have the supply, we lock in the margin. And that is very simple. I mean we price every customer based on the forward curve. So I don't think that -- that doesn't create any exposure. 
Perhaps you're talking about the variable rates, the month-to-month, and whether or not we can buy that. But keep in mind, I mean a variable rate is exactly that. You have the ability to change the price if the underlying commodity price in the market changes. So that's why I was saying, we have the ability to pass through some of these costs. 
And we're not the only ones exposed to it. Every single retail energy provider, electric provider, is exposed to these changes in power prices. So it's not like this puts us in a disadvantage. I mean it impacts the supply cost of all retail electric providers. So you would expect a similar -- a move to offset that increase. That's why I'd say, I still don't understand this concept around why some investors or some of you think that we're short power. 
I mean having a variable price customer allows us to change prices. Whether it's up or down, if prices are coming down, perhaps we can move the customers' pricing down. But if prices rise, we can do the same.  So in the medium term -- when you're talking about the medium term, I'm assuming you're talking about 12 to 18 months. I mean that's plenty of time to take price actions. And that's what we have done in the past. We consistently see that. So that's how I think about the exposure.  
And on the fixed price, it's -- we always do it back-to-back. So I'm not concerned about fixed-price customers that go multiyear, particularly for C&I customers."

So I mean I'm really glad to see that you will be restarting your share buyback program. Now is that in any way implicitly stating that your investment-grade rating is sort of delayed inherently given the Uri storm? And as such, there is no point in trying to delever as quickly as possible, hence, you have some more flexibility? Because, again, I would have expected that you're going to try to go back to that, say, 2.5 to 2.75 net debt to EBITDA as quickly as possible. And clearly, buybacks are not going to help with this."

We haven't changed our targets of investment-grade credit metrics. We changed just the trajectory on how to get there.

So it's very consistent with the conversations that we have with rating agencies.  I don't control the credit rating timing. That's not on us. That's on the rating agencies. We believe that 3x is a strong -- a very strong balance sheet, but we still are targeting 2.5 to 2.75. But given this change in glide path, it has provided some financial flexibility to -- if we have excess cash, which we anticipate to have by the end of the year, then we will allocate that through the guidance and principles that are very transparent and that we have communicated to all of you. 
So that's how I expect to start allocating this excess cash, which includes share buybacks towards the end of the year when we start having some excess cash, but I mean that's going to be contingent on when do we close the asset sale and when do we start seeing the money from the Uri mitigants."

I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start on Slide 4 of today's presentation. Our consumer services platform performed well through the summer and delivered stable results. We are narrowing our 2021 financial guidance at the low end of the range and initiating 2022 financial guidance. Our platform is navigating the unprecedented supply chain constraints, and we are actively working to mitigate the financial impact. Finally, we continue to make progress on our 5-year growth plan. In the near term, we are focused on the Direct Energy integration, organic growth in power and gas and expanding our customer base with dual product options.
Moving to the financial and operational results for the third quarter on Slide 5. Beginning on the left-hand side of the slide, I want to start with safety. We delivered another quarter of top decile safety performance. This marks 10 straight quarters at this level of performance, a testament towards our strong safety culture. As we continue our return to the office, the safety and well-being of our employees remains our top priority. During the third quarter, we delivered $767 million of adjusted EBITDA, which brings our year-to-date results to $1.99 billion or 19% higher than the previous year, driven primarily by the acquisition of Direct Energy. We are However, narrowing our 2021 guidance to the lower half of the range, primarily as a result of unanticipated supply chain constraints impacting fourth quarter results. This will also impact 2022 guidance, which I will address shortly.
During the quarter, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives. First, Direct Energy integration is well ahead of pace, achieving $144 million year-to-date or 107% of the original full year plan. We are increasing our 2021 target to $175 million, which reflects the early realization of synergy targets in 2021. We are maintaining the full planned target of $300 million run rate in 2023. Next, in ERCOT, the PUCT continues to advance necessary actions to improve market reliability. In October, the PUCT implemented Phase 1 of the winter weatherization standards, which will be in effect for this upcoming winter. This weatherization standard adopts best practices and addresses weather-related issues that occurred during Uri. We are making the necessary investments in our fleet to be in compliance and ready for winter operations.
On market design, the PUCT remains focused on a comprehensive solution to improve reliability and incentivize dispatchable resources. At NRG, we support this direction and have taken a leading role in offering ideas for the PUCT's consideration. We have proposed a comprehensive solution to prioritize reliability and achieve it through competitive solutions. The PUCT also approved the final orders for securitization to ensure a healthy and competitive markets. I want to comment and thank the governor, legislature and PUCT for tirelessly working to address the issues Uri expose and to harden the ERCOT system and protect the integrity of the competitive markets that has benefited consumers over the years.
Now turning to home retail. We continue to advance our best-in-class customer experience during the quarter. Our Reliant brand was recognized with 2 awards during the quarter. The North American Customer Centricity Award in the crisis management category and the 2021 Innovation Leader Impact Award for the make it solar offering, which is a renewable energy initiative that allows customers to support solar energy without installing panels. Now moving to the right-hand side of the slide to discuss 2022. First, as we detailed during our June Investor Day, 2022 is a staging year for high-grading our business and achieving our 5-year 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth plan. In 2022, we remain focused on integrating Direct Energy and achieving the plant's high-quality synergies, removing or streamlining our east generation business that continues to weigh on our valuation given earnings and terminal value concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth, deploying small amounts of capital to prepare the platform for growth and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.
With that, we're introducing 2022 financial guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 billion to $1.44 billion. This guidance reflects our plan to fully realize our planned synergies and to streamline our east generation business. Also impacting this guidance our temporary impacts from unforeseen supply chain constraints, ancillary services charges in ERCOT and our previously announced Limestone Unit 1 outage through April 2022. But leave no doubt, now that we have identified these near-term headwinds, we are focused on mitigating these impacts into 2022. Finally, we are also announcing an 8% increase in our 2022 dividend, in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%. 
Now let me turn the call over to Alberto for a more detailed financial review. And after I will discuss how we're advancing our consumer services 5-year road map. Alberto?"

The increase i",1532,"Thank you, Mauricio. Moving to the quarterly results. I will now turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $767 million in adjusted EBITDA or $15 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related additional synergies achieved in Q3, partially offset by the impact of the outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility and other headwinds related to the onset of supply chain constraints. Specifically by region, the East benefited by $89 million, driven by the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition and some incremental synergies and cost savings. This benefit was partially offset by reduced volume in our sale of power as well as lower profitability from our PGM core fleet due to supply chain constraints for chemical necessary to run the environmental controls.
Next, our Texas region decreased by $68 million due to the higher supplier cost to serve our retail load. With the outage of Limestone Unit 1, we had to purchase higher price supply to supplement this lost generation. This increase in supply cost was partially offset by the contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. As a reminder, we benefited the last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the COVID-driven economic shutdown and a favorable mix in usage between home and business customers.
The free cash flow before growth in the quarter was $395 million, a reduction of EUR 230 million year-over-year, driven primarily by 2 factors, a $75 million increase in cash interest due to the EUR 3 billion in Direct Energy financing in late 2020 and second is the movement in inventory. During Q3 2020, we reduced inventory by $60 million, driven by seasonal trends and coal utilization. While during Q3 2021, we built up inventories by $75 million, mostly for the seasonal needs of the gas business. This overall resulted in a $135 million negative cash flow balance.
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability is significant and driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with a $10 million increase in onetime costs offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants now that positive development and the Texas legislator have increased the probability of recouping some of our Uri losses. The total negative cash impact has shifted slightly as the estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers have been reduced by higher billings in 2021. As a consequence, the 2021 early negative cash impact has increased by $85 million with a corresponding movement in 2022. We expect to receive the majority of the securitization proceeds during the first quarter of 2022 with a possible first tranche later this year.
Now turning to the Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. During 2021, we have identified further areas for cost synergies, and we're able to realize certain synergies earlier than anticipated. Overall, we are on track to achieve $175 million of synergy for 2021 with $144 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectation as well as onetime cost savings achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals. As you are all familiar, supply chain constraints are affecting many industry across the country, and they are affecting our operation as well. In addition to our Limestone Unit 1 outage, which is now extended to mid-April 2022, constraint in the availability of coal are impacting both costs and volumes. In addition, our Midwest generation coal plants are impacted by a shortfall in necessary chemicals to run the environmental controls of the fleet. Due to these constraints, we are now narrowing our guidance to the lower end of our original guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. We are currently near the bottom of this range, but we are working intensely to improve our results. Consequently, we also narrowed our free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion. 
Moving to Slide 8. We are initiating guidance for 2022 to $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion. This is a significant decrease from our current 2021 results, driven by 3 elements as laid out on this slide, planned divestiture of East and West power plants and the activation of our Midwest generation already highlighted in the Investor Day, the reduction in the New York City capacity revenues and the impact from the transitory costs that are related to 2022 only. As mentioned above, the contribution from Direct Energy would increase in 2022 by $130 million, driven by the anticipated increase in synergies. We have already realize more synergy benefits in 2021, accelerating some action, and therefore, we believe that we can achieve our target for 2022 of $225 million.
Next, we anticipate the sale of our East and West assets to close next month for a net of $620 million in sales proceeds, reducing EBITDA by $100 million going forward. With the retirement of our coal assets in the East in mid-2022, EBITDA will decrease by $90 million in the year. In addition, due to change in New York capacity market parameters, capacity prices have decreased on a more permanent basis, affecting our Astoria and our [indiscernible] toci facilities and reducing EBITDA by a further $30 million. As mentioned above, we are experiencing a onetime extended forced outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility. And what we believe to be transitory supply chain constraints that are negatively impacting 2022 results, and we expect to correct them in 2023. With increased power prices the extended outage at our limestone facility is increasing our supply cost by $50 million to April 2022. With the advent of constraints on coal and chemical deliveries and commodity price, we expect fuel and supply cost to increase by $100 million in 2022, while returning to normal levels in future years.
Lastly, with the change in the ERCOT market, we are expecting an increase in ancillary charges that were initiated after we contracted the customers and were not included in our margin price. In the future, these costs will be included in future contract prices. But during 2022, we will incur an incremental $70 million of ancillary costs. This outcome is negative to us and our management team is working tireless to mitigate these incremental costs as best as possible, including further onetime cost savings opportunity. Given increased volatility in this environment, we are also increasing the range of our guidance with the expectation that we can identify enough mitigants in 2022 to offset the portion of these costs. The reduction in EBITDA is the primary driver for the lower free cash flow before growth.
I will now turn to Slide 9, where we are updating our plan 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left most column, we have updated the 2021 excess cash with the latest free cash flow midpoint to $1.49 billion, reducing available cash by $50 million. Moving to the Winter Storm Uri, and as discussed before, the midpoint for the net estimated cash impact for winter storm Uri remains at $600 million. But given the increased utilization of customer credit in 2021, the net cash impact after assumed mitigants have increased to $535 million in 2021 and decreased by the same amount in 2022 to only $ 65million. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization builds HP4492 and SB1580 have been approved and the regulation has been finalized by ERCOT the PUCT. We anticipate that the main portion of the financing and release of funds will occur during the first quarter of 2022.
Moving to the next column to pursue our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio we completed the delivering of $250 million plus early redemption fees of $64 million in Q3 totaling $319 million. Finally, we have added the anticipated sale of 4.8 gigawatts of generation in the East and West regions. The net cash proceeds of $620 million will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality. After incremental fees of $16 million, the remaining $104 million will be available for general capital allocation. This leaves $375 million of remaining capital for allocation, and this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the securitization process.
Finally, on Slide 10, after reducing our corporate debt balance for 2021, that delevering and for the minimum cash our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which when based at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA implies a ratio slightly above 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As discussed during Investor Day, given our growth profile, our goal is to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet continued to target the 2.5 to 2.75 ratio, primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings.
Back to you, Mauricio."

I want to provide an update on our progress executing our 5-year growth road map. As I told you at Investor Day, 2 of our strategic priorities are to optimize the core and to grow the core, optimizing the core will focus on strengthening our power and gas businesses completing the Direct Energy integration and continuing the decarbonization of our generation fleet. The Direct Energy transaction significantly increased our scale and materially enhance our natural gas capabilities. This created 2 near-term opportunities, increasing our number of pure natural gas customers and expanding our dual product capabilities within our existing network of customers. Efforts in both of these areas are well underway, and we will leverage the collective experience of NRG and Direct Energy teams to execute on our growth in these targeted areas.
In addition to natural gas and dual product customer growth, we will continue to invest in our core power business to extend our market-leading position in competitive retail electricity by continuing to meet the customers where they are and to deliver the innovation that customers have come to expect from NRG and its family of brands. The Direct Energy integration is well on track. And today, we are reiterating our full synergy plan targets. Upon closing Direct Energy, we immediately begun rationalizing offices in areas with significant employee geographic overlap and completed a number of critical system consolidations without any meaningful impact to the operations of the company. Given that the integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan, we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergy targets that we have shared with you.
Our portfolio decarbonization efforts remain ongoing. The 4.8 gigawatt asset sale to ArcLight remains on track to close by year-end with only New York PSC approval outstanding. We have 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in PJM slated to retire in mid-2022 with the remainder of our PJM fleet under strategic review. We continue to execute on our renewable PPA strategy, having signed 2.7 gigawatts nationally and expect to procure more renewable power through additional RFOs for solar, wind and battery storage in our core markets.
Now shifting to grow the core. Our objectives are centered around distinct customer experiences in both power services and home services. As we work to shape these distinct customer experiences, we will break them down into discrete pieces and apply a test-and-learn discipline in order to refine our customer value proposition, optimal business model and go-to-market strategy. By starting small, it allows us to stay nimble and deploy limited capital while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings for sustained long-term growth. 2022 will serve as a staging year, where we will be focused on the test-and-learn environment I just discussed. Although this staging year will not be as a growth capital intensive as the later years, it is a crucial year in which we will need to develop data back conviction in our initiatives in order to have the confidence to deploy more significant capital in 2023 and 2024. We will be sure to share more on our 2022 efforts as the year progresses.
Now as we're turning our attention to 2022 with limited cost on our capital, I wanted to take a moment to review our capital allocation framework and capital available for allocation. Beginning on the left-hand side of the slide, we expect to have over $1.6 billion in capital available for allocation, including $375 million of unallocated cash from 2021. We will apply our capital allocation principles that are outlined in the right side of the slide. Beyond safety and operational excellence, our first use of capital for allocation is to achieve and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our focus is to grow into our target metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x by the end of 2023, resulting in the vast majority of our excess cash to be available for allocation through our 50% return of capital and 50% opportunistic frameworks. I look forward to providing you a comprehensive capital allocation update on our next earnings call, but this should give you a good idea of our financial flexibility. I am proud of the strength of our platform that despite near-term supply chain constraints, continues to provide our customers differentiated products and services and for our shareholders, the financial flexibility to both execute our ambitious 5-year growth plan, while returning significant cash to our investors.
Now turning to Slide 14. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. During the third quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our strategic priorities, but we still have work to do this year. Over the remainder of the year, we expect to close on our announced asset sales and subsequently execute on our capital allocation priorities. As we move into 2022, I am confident our platform is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value.
So with that, Benjamin, we'll open the line for questions."

413857,1684980935,2424945,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Yes, Julien. So let me start by we all seen and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, our call generation flex us up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because, I mean, we have been,",536,"Yes, Julien. So let me start by we all seen and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, our call generation flex us up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because, I mean, we have been, for the past 4, 5 years, generating at a certain level, not only us, but the entire coal generation industry. So when you rapidly flex up, our coal supply chain doesn't flex up as quickly as you would like it to be, whether it's the commodity, the delivery, which is rail or chemicals, which is to control the emissions. Now when that happens, in a normal circumstance, we will use that incremental generation to serve our month-to-month customers that are on their variable pricing. Now when we are constrained when we cannot flex off because of the supply constraints, then we have to go to market and procure at higher prices. which means then we have to make a decision, how much of these higher cost we pass through our customers. Keep in mind that we are balancing here margin stability and retention. So -- and one of the objectives that we have when we see these sudden increases -- short-term solid increases, we don't want to cause a bill shot to our customers. We want to make sure that we maintain -- that we pass some of the costs, but not all of the cost. Obviously, in the mid and the long term, you can pass all the costs. But in the short term, you really want to avoid deal shocks because if you lose the customer, you're also going to spend money in acquiring back the customer. So that's why, this is very deliberate. This is a balancing act between margin stability and retention. Now in terms of the duration of this, I expect this to be primarily in the first half of the year. I think this will ease off in the second half because supply chain and the core supply chain will respond to increasing pricing levels.
Now to your question around realized and unrealized, most of these right now is unrealized, but because these are month-to-month customers. So we have some levers to mitigate the impact. I mean the first one is, obviously, how do we optimize our coal generation? Should we be looking only at running when you have really high-margin hours and then backing down in low-margin hours? We are in constant communication and testing the market in terms of our retail pricing strategy and priorities. I mean the other lever is Direct Energy synergies, and we're going to continue looking at if we can expand Direct Energy. And then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story. So things can change fairly quickly just like the entire system moved up in the back of natural gas, it can come back down to more normal levels, and therefore, these will -- these constraints will ease and we'll be back to a more normalized, I guess, environment. So I hope that this provides you that, I guess, that framework and that explanation on what we're seeing today."

What that means is the business -- our business that is generating tremendous excess cash over $1.6 billion. We're going to be using our capital allocation principles, which is going to be returning capital to shareholders and growing.

Our run rate, we actually have it on Slide 8.  We have normalized that to around $2.2 billion. And we say they're transitory because the transitory supply chain is when you're flexing up your coal generation, the supply chain takes a little time. I think about mining, railroads sets that are allocated to coal and chemicals. So you can -- when the plant can flex off fairly quickly, a supply chain that has been sized for the type of generation that we have experienced for the past 5 or 6 years. It doesn't flex off that quickly. So that's why I said it's going to take a little bit of time. I expect this to be in the first half of the year. I think this is going to ease off in the second half of the year. So that's why I referred to them as transitory. But Chris, can you just go into detail around the ancillary services?"

So that's been the bigger of the 2 impacts in terms of ancillary changes that they've made so far. Now we're still waiting to see, right, PUCT has -- had working sessions, and we've seen a memo from Chairman Lake detailing his thoughts. There's plenty of debate about, hey, what do we want to do on ancillaries going forward and certainly on the ORDC parameters, too. Brattle Group is coming in. They're going to study various combinations of at what part of reserves should you start ORDC to kick in, at what slope should it climb and where is the cap kind of a thing. So there's a lot of moving pieces right now in terms of market design. That should be according to the schedule that I've seen nailed down by mid- to late December. I think that there planning on posting something around December 20, which will be kind of their pick of ORDC changes whether or not they have a winter fuel ancillary in there, which is different than these 2 ancillaries I'm talking about, what level do they want for the nonspin. And then also, we've been advocating for an LSE obligation that would phase in over a couple of years. And Chairman Lake included that in his memo too. So there's a bunch of market design stuff that's moving that we'll be getting to here as we get to the end of the year."

So let me start with the gas business perhaps because that's the newest for all of you under our ownership. Our gas business, think of it as a logistics business. We don't take commodity price risk. Every time we sign a customer, we back-to-back it with natural gas. And as part of that, we get a tremendous amount of, call it, assets pipeline, storage, LDC relationships. So that infrastructure gives us the ability to manage some of the volatility that exists less on the price of NYMEX and more on the basis. So I feel very confident that our team has the ability to manage because of that very large infrastructure network, natural gas network that we have. So I'm actually quite comfortable with the exposure of higher natural gas prices on our natural gas business. And then on the power side, I think we -- I already described it, Steve, in terms of higher gas prices, you have this issue on the coal constraints. But in general, think of this almost as inflationary pressure. We can pass it through, and we actually choose to pass some of that in the long term -- in the medium to long term, you put everything. And it's going to be a balancing act between, you don't want to cross build shot to our customers. At the same time, you want to manage stable margins and good retention numbers, which are very, very compelling on our business. So that's how I'm thinking about it. And that's why I mean, if it's a structurally higher gas prices, I don't have a big issue with that. I mean the issue it always comes when gas prices move up very, very quickly. And then you have these constraints on the coal supply chain, and that's what we're addressing this here as transitory."

I'm joined this morning by Alberto Fornaro, Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. 
I'd like to start on Slide 4 of today's presentation. Our consumer services platform performed well through this summer and delivered stable results. We are narrowing our 2021 financial guidance at the low end of the range and initiating 2022 financial guidance. Our platform is navigating the unprecedented supply chain constraints, and we are actively working to mitigate the financial impact. Finally, we continue to make progress on our 5-year growth plan. In the near term, we are focused on the Direct Energy integration, organic growth in power and gas, and expanding our customer base with dual product options. 
Moving to the financial and operational results for the third quarter on Slide 5. Beginning on the left-hand side of the slide, I want to start with safety. We delivered another quarter of top decile safety performance. This marks 10 straight quarters at this level of performance, a testament towards our strong safety culture. As we continue our return to the office, the safety and well-being of our employees remains our top priority. During the third quarter, we delivered $767 million of adjusted EBITDA, which brings our year-to-date results to $1.99 billion, or 19% higher than the previous year, driven primarily by the acquisition of Direct Energy. We are, however, narrowing our 2021 guidance to the lower half of the range, primarily as a result of unanticipated supply chain constraints impacting fourth quarter results. This will also impact 2022 guidance, which I will address shortly. 
During the quarter, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives. First, Direct Energy integration is well ahead of pace, achieving $144 million year-to-date or 107% of the original full year plan. We are increasing our 2021 target to $175 million, which reflects the early realization of synergy targets in 2021. We are maintaining the full planned target of $300 million run rate in 2023. 
Next, in ERCOT, the PUCT continues to advance necessary actions to improve market reliability. In October, the PUCT implemented Phase 1 of the winter weatherization standards, which will be in effect for this upcoming winter. This weatherization standard adopts best practices and addresses weather-related issues that occurred during Uri. We are making the necessary investments in our fleet to be in compliance and ready for winter operations. 
On market design, the PUCT remains focused on a comprehensive solution to improve reliability and incentivize dispatchable resources. At NRG, we support this direction and have taken a leading role in offering ideas for the PUCT's consideration. We have proposed a comprehensive solution to prioritize reliability and achieve it through competitive solutions. The PUCT also approved the final orders for securitization to ensure a healthy and competitive market. I want to comment and thank the governor, legislature and PUCT for tirelessly working to address the issues Uri exposed and to harden the ERCOT system and protect the integrity of the competitive markets that have benefited consumers over the years. 
Now turning to Home Retail. We continue to advance our best-in-class customer experience during the quarter. Our Reliant brand was recognized with 2 awards during the quarter. The North American Customer Centricity Award in the Crisis Management category and the 2021 Innovation Leader Impact Award for the Make It Solar offering, which is a renewable energy initiative that allows customers to support solar energy without installing panels. 
Now moving to the right-hand side of the slide to discuss 2022. First, as we detailed during our June Investor Day, 2022 is a staging year for high-grading our business and achieving our 5-year 15% to 20% free cash flow per share growth plan. In 2022, we remain focused on integrating Direct Energy and achieving the plant's high-quality synergies, removing or streamlining our East generation business that continues to weigh on our valuation given earnings and terminal value concerns that otherwise would have masked our retail growth, deploying small amounts of capital to prepare the platform for growth and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. 
With that, we're introducing 2022 financial guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth of $1.14 billion to $1.44 billion. This guidance reflects our plan to fully realize our planned synergies and to streamline our East generation business. Also impacting this guidance are temporary impacts from unforeseen supply chain constraints, ancillary services charges in ERCOT and our previously announced Limestone Unit 1 outage through April 2022. But leave no doubt, now that we have identified these near-term headwinds, we are focused on mitigating these impacts into 2022. 
Finally, we are also announcing an 8% increase in our 2022 dividend, in line with our stated dividend growth rate of 7% to 9%.  
Now let me turn the call over to Alberto for a more detailed financial review. And after, I will discuss how we're advancing our consumer services' 5-year road map. Alberto?"

I will now turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $767 million in adjusted EBITDA, or $15 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase",1527,"Thank you, Mauricio. Moving to the quarterly results. I will now turn to Slide 7 for a brief review of our financials. For the quarter, NRG delivered $767 million in adjusted EBITDA, or $15 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase in consolidated earnings was driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy and the related additional synergies achieved in Q3, partially offset by the impact of the outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility and other headwinds related to the onset of supply chain constraints. 
Specifically by region, the East benefited by $89 million, driven by the expected contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition and some incremental synergies and cost savings. This benefit was partially offset by reduced volume in our sale of power as well as lower profitability from our PJM core fleet due to supply chain constraints for chemical necessary to run the environmental controls. 
Next, our Texas region decreased by $68 million due to the higher supplier cost to serve our retail load. With the outage of Limestone Unit 1, we had to purchase higher price supply to supplement this lost generation. This increase in supply cost was partially offset by the contribution from the Direct Energy acquisition. As a reminder, we benefited the last year from exceptionally low market power prices realized during the COVID-driven economic shutdown and a favorable mix in usage between home and business customers. 
The free cash flow before growth in the quarter was $395 million, a reduction of $230 million year-over-year, driven primarily by 2 factors, a $75 million increase in cash interest due to the $3 billion in Direct Energy financing in late 2020 and second is the movement in inventory. During Q3 2020, we reduced inventory by $60 million, driven by seasonal trends and coal utilization. While during Q3 2021, we built up inventories by $75 million, mostly for the seasonal needs of the gas business. This overall resulted in a $135 million negative cash flow balance.  
On a year-to-date basis, our progress in terms of incremental profitability is significant and driven by the acquisition of Direct Energy. Our expectation for the net impact from Winter Storm Uri remains at $500 million to $700 million with a $10 million increase in onetime costs, offset by a similar increase in the range of expected mitigants now that positive development and the Texas legislator have increased the probability of recouping some of our Uri losses. 
The total negative cash impact has shifted slightly as the estimated bill credits owed to large commercial and industrial customers have been reduced by higher billings in 2021. As a consequence, the 2021 Uri negative cash impact has increased by $85 million with a corresponding movement in 2022. We expect to receive the majority of the securitization proceeds during the first quarter of 2022 with a possible first tranche later this year. 
Now turning to the Direct Energy integration. We are confirming our goal to achieve a run rate of $300 million synergies by 2023. During 2021, we have identified further areas for cost synergies, and we're able to realize certain synergies earlier than anticipated. 
Overall, we are on track to achieve $175 million of synergy for 2021, with $144 million realized year-to-date. Synergy expectation as well as onetime cost savings achieved so far are fully embedded, respectively, in our 2021 guidance and year-to-date actuals. 
As you are all familiar, supply chain constraints are affecting many industry across the country, and they are affecting our operation as well. In addition to our Limestone Unit 1 outage, which is now extended to mid-April 2022, constraint in the availability of coal are impacting both costs and volumes. In addition, our Midwest Generation coal plants are impacted by a shortfall in necessary chemicals to run the environmental controls of the fleet. 
Due to these constraints, we are now narrowing our guidance to the lower end of our original guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. We are currently near the bottom of this range, but we are working intensely to improve our results. Consequently, we have also narrowed our free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion.  
Moving to Slide 8. We are initiating guidance for 2022 to $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion. This is a significant decrease from our current 2021 results, driven by 3 elements as laid out on this slide, planned divestiture of East and West power plants and the activation of our Midwest Generation, already highlighted in the Investor Day, the reduction in the New York City capacity revenues and the impact from the transitory costs that are related to 2022 only. 
As mentioned above, the contribution from Direct Energy would increase in 2022 by $130 million, driven by the anticipated increase in synergies. We have already realized more synergy benefits in 2021, accelerating some action, and therefore, we believe that we can achieve our target for 2022 of $225 million. 
Next, we anticipate the sale of our East and West assets to close next month for a net of $620 million in sales proceeds, reducing EBITDA by $100 million going forward. With the retirement of our coal assets in the East in mid-2022, EBITDA will decrease by $90 million in the year. 
In addition, due to change in New York capacity market parameters, capacity prices have decreased on a more permanent basis, affecting our Astoria and Arthur Kill facilities, and reducing EBITDA by a further $30 million. As mentioned above, we are experiencing a onetime extended forced outage at our Limestone Unit 1 facility and what we believe to be transitory supply chain constraints that are negatively impacting 2022 results. And we expect to correct them in 2023. With increased power prices, the extended outage at our Limestone facility is increasing our supply cost by $50 million to April 2022. 
With the advent of constraints on coal and chemical deliveries and commodity price, we expect fuel and supply cost to increase by $100 million in 2022, while returning to normal levels in future years. 
Lastly, with the change in the ERCOT market, we are expecting an increase in ancillary charges that were initiated after we contracted the customers and were not included in our margin price. In the future, these costs will be included in future contract prices. But during 2022, we will incur an incremental $70 million of ancillary costs. This outcome is negative to us, and our management team is working tireless to mitigate these incremental costs as best as possible, including further onetime cost savings opportunity. 
Given increased volatility in this environment, we are also increasing the range of our guidance with the expectation that we can identify enough mitigants in 2022 to offset the portion for these costs. The reduction in EBITDA is the primary driver for the lower free cash flow before growth. 
I will now turn to Slide 9, where we are updating our plan 2021 capital allocation. As in the past, our practice on this slide is to highlight changes from last quarter in blue. Starting from the left-most column, we have updated the 2021 excess cash with the latest free cash flow midpoint to $1.49 billion, reducing available cash by $50 million. Moving to the Winter Storm Uri, and as discussed before, the midpoint for the net estimated cash impact for Winter Storm Uri remains at $600 million. But given the increased utilization of customer credit in 2021, the net cash impact after assumed mitigants has increased to $535 million in 2021 and decreased by the same amount in 2022 to only $65 million. As you are aware, the much anticipated securitization builds HB4492 and SB1580 have been approved and the regulation has been finalized by ERCOT and the PUCT. We anticipate that the main portion of the financing and release of funds will occur during the first quarter of 2022. 
Moving to the next column, to pursue our targeted net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, we completed the delivering of $250 million, plus early redemption fees of $64 million in Q3, totaling $319 million. Finally, we have added the anticipated sale of 4.8 gigawatts of generation in the East and West regions. The net cash proceeds of $620 million will be utilized partly for debt reduction, $500 million to maintain leverage neutrality. After incremental fees of $16 million, the remaining $104 million will be available for general capital allocation. This leaves $375 million of remaining capital for allocation, and this capital is dependent on the successful conclusion of the securitization process. 
Finally, on Slide 10, after reducing our corporate debt balance for 2021, debt delevering and for the minimum cash, our 2021 net debt balance will be approximately $7.9 billion, which, when based at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA, implies a ratio slightly above 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As discussed during Investor Day, given our growth profile, our goal is to achieve investment-grade metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and continue to target the 2.5 to 2.75 ratio, primarily through the full realization of Direct Energy run rate earnings. 
Back to you, Mauricio."

As I told you at Investor Day, 2 of our strategic priorities are to optimize the core and to grow the core. Optimizing the core will focus on strengthening our power and gas businesses, completing the Direct Energy integration and continuing the decarbonization of our generation fleet. The Direct Energy transaction significantly increased our scale and materially enhanced our natural gas capabilities. This created 2 near-term opportunities, increasing our number of pure natural gas customers and expanding our dual product capabilities within our existing network of customers. Efforts in both of these areas are well underway, and we will leverage the collective experience of NRG and Direct Energy teams to execute on our growth in these targeted areas. 
In addition to natural gas and dual product customer growth, we will continue to invest in our core power business to extend our market-leading position in competitive retail electricity by continuing to meet the customers, where they are and to deliver the innovation that customers have come to expect from NRG and its family of brands. 
The Direct Energy integration is well on track. And today, we are reiterating our full synergy plan targets. Upon closing Direct Energy, we immediately began rationalizing offices in areas with significant employee geographic overlap and completed a number of critical system consolidations without any meaningful impact to the operations of the company. Given that the integration is being led by the same team responsible for executing the transformation plan, we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergy targets that we have shared with you. 
Our portfolio decarbonization efforts remain ongoing. The 4.8 gigawatt asset sale to ArcLight remains on track to close by year-end with only New York PSC approval outstanding. We have 1.6 gigawatts of coal assets in PJM slated to retire in mid-2022, with the remainder of our PJM fleet under strategic review. We continue to execute on our renewable PPA strategy, having signed 2.7 gigawatts nationally and expect to procure more renewable power through additional RFOs for solar, wind and battery storage in our core markets. 
Now shifting to grow the core. Our objectives are centered around distinct customer experiences in both power services and home services. As we work to shape these distinct customer experiences, we will break them down into discrete pieces and apply a test-and-learn discipline in order to refine our customer value proposition, optimal business model and go-to-market strategy. By starting small, it allows us to stay nimble and deploy limited capital while gathering critical market intelligence to inform how we approach these new customer offerings for sustained long-term growth. 2022 will serve as a staging year, where we will be focused on the test-and-learn environment I just discussed. Although this staging year will not be as a growth capital intensive as the later years, it is a crucial year in which we will need to develop data backed conviction in our initiatives in order to have the confidence to deploy more significant capital in 2023 and 2024. We will be sure to share more on our 2022 efforts as the year progresses. 
Now as we're turning our attention to 2022 with limited cost on our capital, I wanted to take a moment to review our capital allocation framework and capital available for allocation. Beginning on the left-hand side of the slide, we expect to have over $1.6 billion in capital available for allocation, including $375 million of unallocated cash from 2021. We will apply our capital allocation principles that are outlined in the right side of the slide. Beyond safety and operational excellence, our first use of capital for allocation is to achieve and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our focus is to grow into our target metrics of 2.5 to 2.75x by the end of 2023, resulting in the vast majority of our excess cash to be available for allocation through our 50% return of capital and 50% opportunistic frameworks. 
I look forward to providing you a comprehensive capital allocation update on our next earnings call, but this should give you a good idea of our financial flexibility. I am proud of the strength of our platform that, despite near-term supply chain constraints, continues to provide our customers differentiated products and services and, for our shareholders, the financial flexibility to both execute our ambitious 5-year growth plan, while returning significant cash to our investors. 
Now turning to Slide 14. I want to provide a few closing thoughts on today's presentation. During the third quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our strategic priorities, but we still have work to do this year. Over the remainder of the year, we expect to close on our announced asset sales and subsequently execute on our capital allocation priorities. As we move into 2022, I am confident our platform is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value. 
So with that, Benjamin, we'll open the line for questions."

413857,1684980935,2425234,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Yes, Julien. So let me start by -- we've all seen now and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, our coal generation flexes up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because, I mean, we ha",540,"Yes, Julien. So let me start by -- we've all seen now and experienced a pretty solid increase in natural gas prices. So when natural gas prices move up, our coal generation flexes up and that caused a stress in the coal supply chain because, I mean, we have been, for the past 4, 5 years, generating at a certain level, not only us, but the entire coal generation industry. So when you rapidly flex up, our coal supply chain doesn't flex up as quickly as you would like it to be; whether it's the commodity; the delivery, which is rail; or chemicals, which is to control the emissions. Now when that happens, in a normal circumstance, we will use that incremental generation to serve our month-to-month customers that are on their variable pricing. 
Now when we are constrained, when we cannot flex up because of the supply constraints, then we have to go to market and procure at higher prices, which means then we have to make a decision, how much of these higher cost we pass through our customers. Keep in mind that we are balancing here margin stability and retention. So -- and one of the objectives that we have when we see these sudden increases -- short-term sudden increases, we don't want to cause a bill shock to our customers. We want to make sure that we maintain -- that we pass some of the costs, but not all of the cost. 
Obviously, in the mid and the long term, you can pass all the costs. But in the short term, you really want to avoid bill shocks because if you lose the customer, you're also going to spend money in acquiring back the customer. So that's why, this is very deliberate. This is a balancing act between margin stability and retention. 
Now in terms of the duration of this, I expect this to be primarily in the first half of the year. I think this will ease off in the second half because supply chain and the coal supply chain will respond to increasing pricing levels.
Now to your question around realized and unrealized. Most of these right now is unrealized, but -- because these are month-to-month customers. So we have some levers to mitigate the impact. I mean the first one is, obviously, how do we optimize our coal generation? Should we be looking only at running when you have really high-margin hours and then backing down in low-margin hours? We are in constant communication and testing the market in terms of our retail pricing strategy and priorities. I mean the other lever is Direct Energy synergies, and we're going to continue looking at if we can expand those Direct Energy synergies. 
And then finally, as you mentioned, I mean, this is a very evolving story. So things can change fairly quickly, just like the entire system moved up in the back of natural gas. It can come back down to more normal levels, and therefore, these will -- these constraints will ease and we'll be back to a more normalized, I guess, environment. 
So I hope that this provides you that, I guess, that framework and that explanation on what we're seeing today."

So we're very, very excited about that. 
Now having said that, I expect 2022 to perhaps be a little bit lighter on the investing in growth as opposed to '23, '24 and '25. What that means is the business -- our business that is generating tremendous excess cash, over $1.6 billion, we're going to be using our capital allocation principles, which is going to be returning capital to shareholders and growing. But since we're going to be only deploying, I would say, a smaller part in 2022, I think you should expect our share of returning capital to be bigger than the 50% that we have indicated in the past. So that's how I would think about it. 
Now we continue -- we remain committed to our 2.5 to 2.75 by 2023, and we expect to achieve that through growing our EBITDA. And we grow the EBITDA by executing on the Direct Energy synergies and now with the incremental growth EBITDA that we can generate.

Our run rate, we actually have it on Slide 8.  We have normalized that to around $2.32 billion. 
And we say they're transitory because the transitory supply chain is when you're flexing up your coal generation, the supply chain takes a little time. I think about mining, railroads sets that are allocated to coal and chemicals. So you can -- when the plant can flex up fairly quickly, a supply chain that has been sized for the type of generation that we have experienced for the past 5 or 6 years, it doesn't flex up that quickly.

Now we're still waiting to see, right, PUCT has -- had working sessions, and we've seen a memo from Chairman Lake detailing his thoughts.

They're going to study various combinations of at what part of reserves should you start ORDC to kick in, at what slope should it climb and where is the cap kind of a thing. 
So there's a lot of moving pieces right now in terms of market design. That should be according to the schedule that I've seen nailed down by mid- to late December. I think that there planning on posting something around December 20, which will be kind of their pick of ORDC changes, whether or not they have a winter fuel ancillary in there, which is different than these 2 ancillaries I'm talking about, what level do they want for the nonspin. 
And then also, we've been advocating for an LSE obligation that would phase in over a couple of years, and Chairman Lake included that in his memo too. So there's a bunch of market design stuff that's moving that we'll be getting to here as we get to the end of the year."

Now that we have a power and a gas business -- so let me start with the gas business perhaps because that's the newest for all of you under our ownership. Our gas business, think of it as a logistics business. We don't take commodity price risk. Every time we sign a customer, we back-to-back it with natural gas. And as part of that, we get a tremendous amount of, call it, assets pipeline, storage, LDC relationships. 
So that infrastructure gives us the ability to manage some of the volatility that exists, less on the price of NYNEX and more on the basis. So I feel very confident that our team has the ability to manage because of that very large infrastructure network, natural gas network that we have. So I'm actually quite comfortable with the exposure of higher natural gas prices on our natural gas business. 
And then on the power side, I think we -- I already described it, Steve, in terms of higher gas prices, you have this issue on the coal constraints. But in general, think of this almost as inflationary pressure. We can pass it through, and we actually choose to pass some of that in the long term -- in the medium to long term, you pass everything. And it's going to be a balancing act between -- you don't want to cause a bill shock to our customers. At the same time, you want to manage stable margins and good retention numbers, which are very, very compelling on our business. 
So that's how I'm thinking about it. And that's why -- I mean, if it's a structurally higher gas prices, I don't have a big issue with that. I mean the issue, it always comes when gas prices move up very, very quickly. And then you have these constraints on the coal supply chain, and that's what we're addressing this here as transitory."

So my initial take when I read the press release was that all of these issues that are weighing on that [ 2.32 ] normalized EBITDA are related to generation. But really, if you listen to the discussion so far on this call, it seems like all of them are retail-related. And again, I know that you're no longer differentiating between generation and retail, but it seems like you are -- your pitch is an attempt to protect those retail margins, when -- where all of these charges that we're talking about should have been weighing on the profitability of the retail book. 
And again, I understand you don't separate, but I mean, again, to me, it just seems like there is a weakening of the profitability of that large retail book for various reasons, some of which you do not control. But I just feel like you are attempting to make it seem like it's on the generation side when that seems like it's more on the retail side."

We don't have it, and the market indicates that we should. But because we have these constraints, we cannot flex that up. We have to buy it as we pay in the cost. 
So I wouldn't characterize it as a retail thing. I mean I think that's the -- I am trying to connect the two, so you understand the reason why this is happening. It stems from the generation side, but if I actually had a heat [indiscernible] on gas, I wouldn't be having this conversation, right? I mean we would be able to flex up those megawatts and serve our month-to-month customers. 
So I just want to be careful that I wouldn't -- I actually wouldn't characterize it as a retail concern. This is basically starts with an issue on coal supply that impacts our coal generation economics, which then impacts how we were thinking about managing those month-to-month customers that you're pricing every month on a continuous basis."

So just one follow-up here because I guess I don't quite understand the hedging strategy here because I would have thought your -- you had your retail book using economic generation at the time of the hedge. And so in light of the higher power prices, the economic generation from coal plants have increased. You don't really have many gas plants, so there's not much of a detriment. So there should be potential excess generation from the coal plants, which, okay, is not materializing because you don't have access to incremental coal supplies, but why would it be a drag versus the initial hedge?"
