While we faced unprecedented obstacles this past year, I'm pleased to report that Rollins' performance in 2020 is marked by continued growth and solid financials. Rollins' results are a testament to the strength of our business, our exceptional focus on customer service and the commitment to program execution by our people. We're especially proud of our employee's dedication and adaptability through this difficult year. 
They've continued to provide vital services to our customers through very challenging situations, enabling the continuation of our long-term success. Our people are truly our most important asset as they protect our customers' property, health and peace of mind. We're extremely appreciative of their efforts during this unprecedented time. 
At Rollins, we also have an unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe. This has never been more important than this past year, where we faced the threat of the COVID-19 virus. New stringent safety protocols were promptly created, and even today, remain a priority, while we continue to have employed health risks from the virus. 
As a result of working safely through the pandemic, we've also benefited from the trust we have built with our customers. This was confirmed by the strong performance that we had in our Residential Services segment. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our business and the importance of the service we provided. 
Before I wrap up behalf of the entire team at Rollins, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our 2 retiring directors, Jimmy Williams, who joined the Board in 1978; and Bill Desmet, who joined the Board in 1984. Their insightful guidance and service to the company has been invaluable, and we wish them well in their retirement. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide an overview of the quarter and the year. John?"

Revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $536.3 million compared to $506 million for the same quarter in 2019. The net income rose to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $50.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year. 
Revenue for the full year totaled $2.161 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $2.015 billion for 2019. Net income for the full year increased to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to $203.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the same period last year. Andy will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there are 2 adjustments impacting our financials. 
Overall, our team members in the various businesses continue to perform well. We experienced strong growth in residential pest control during the fourth quarter, increasing 11%, while termite and ancillary services grew 8.7%. The year-over-year commercial revenue was down as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the COVID virus due to varying levels of government-driven shutdowns. However, we have continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April, with fourth quarter commercial growth only 0.6% below last year. We are pleased with the steady progress we have achieved under these circumstances. I am very proud of our team and the commitment they show each day to take care of our customers. 
Their dedication and determination were very evident this year as they added many thousands of customers during a challenging time. We believe our fourth quarter and 2020 full year results reflect both the resilience of our company and our people. 
I would now like to take a moment to talk about Rollins' ESG, or environmental, social and governance commitment. We hold ourselves accountable to a high standard of sustainability, social responsibility and good corporate governance. ESG is not just an important part of our business that's become part of our culture. We also launched diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI initiative, internally focused on advancing the culture of inclusion where all employees feel respected and treated fairly with an equitable opportunity to excel. This after is sponsored by Friedman Man Elliott, our Orkin U.S. President. Friedman is working in close partnership with the newly formed advisory council made up of employees from across all brands to drive the EI improvements. Counsel is actively reviewing all policies, conducting can pain awareness, creating listening forums and training with much more to come. 
We're committed to this vision and the journey we will all take together. I'm also pleased to note that we have further strengthened our Board of Directors, adding to an already experienced and strong board with the additions of Susan Bell, Patrick Dunning and Jerry Nicks. His background both Susanville and Patrick Gunning have recently retired from distinguished careers in public accounting, 36 and 39 years, respectively. Both are qualified as financial experts for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission public companies. Gerry Nick comes to our Board is the former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Genuine Parts Company. They are all seasoned executives and accomplished leaders and their diverse experience will be invaluable to help Shape Rollins' future. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our business."

Although I've been with Rollins company since 1999 and have had the opportunity over the years to interact with many of the investors on today's call. This is my first time speaking with you as Chief Operating Officer. I do so with a strong sense of responsibility to our company, our employees, our customers and our shareholders. I'm excited to be here. 
I would also like to thank all of our colleagues for the smooth transition over the last few months and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through the execution of our business strategy. 
During the fourth quarter, we continue to expand the company's presence, not only in the U.S., but yet globally as well. We added 10 strategic acquisitions within the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore. We are very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins' family brands. And as we enter 2021, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. 
This past week, we completed our first virtual company-wide leadership meeting with all our top peers across all our global business units. While we miss being in the same room together, we still found an opportunity to gather on Zoom for productive discussions on items that will be critical for our success in 2021. As an example, one focus area we discussed that has been significant to our growth is mosquito service. This continues to be an excellent add-on service for many customers and has increased greater than 30% over the prior year. We know this will continue to be a great opportunity in 2021. 
As we have discussed in the past, mosquito bourn diseases continue to be an increasing treater round the world, and as family self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. The overall emphasis of our leadership meeting was about executing our plan in 2021, and I have great confidence in our leadership team to make this happen. 
Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials. 
Thank you, Jerry. The obstacles that impacted Q2 and Q3 continued to decrease throughout the quarter, and our operations and non operations groups continue to make tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. We're utilizing mostly remote workforces, which has forced us to continue to evaluate processes and become more efficient. These changes have made us a better company. We're also thankful that we have invested in technology the way that we have over the last 4 to 5 years. Dealing with the increased demand on the residential side of our business and the disruption to routes on the commercial side of our business would have been an extreme challenge to handle without these tools in place. 
For the quarter, our residential pest control and [indiscernible] service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included: a fourth year in a row of metric improvement through our routing and scheduling initiatives, safety improvements that translated to expense reductions and successful continued successful containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year. 
As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP financials for the quarter and GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the full year that were impacted by accelerated vesting of shares in the third quarter of this year and the impact of the pension plan moving up of our Rollins books in 2019. 
Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $536.3 million was an increase of 6% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $506 million. Our income before income taxes was $86.9 million or 20.7% above 2019. Net income was $62.6 million, up 23.4% compared to 2019. Our EPS were $0.13 per diluted share. 
Looking at the full year, revenue of $2.161 billion was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's revenue of $2.015 billion. Our GAAP income before taxes was $354.7 million or 35.8% above 2019. Our net income was $260.8 million, up 28.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.53 per diluted share. 
For the full year, looking at our non-GAAP financials, taking into account the accelerated stock vesting that occurred in the third quarter of this year, and the pension plan moving off of our books in 2019, income before taxes was $361.4 million and was up [ 15. 2 ]%, and net income was $267.5 million this year compared to $229.9 million in 2019, a 16.3% increase. And our non-GAAP EPS were $0.54 compared to $0.47, which is a 14.9% improvement. 
Jerry mentioned our 2021 leadership meeting. While our gathering online instead of in-person was different than the previous years, our focus on messaging and alignment for the year to come continue to be the same. One of the sessions over the 3 days was entitled, ""Items To Make You Successful in 2021."" During this segment, we discussed several different topics that will impact our Verian sustainability through environmental, social and governance, or ESG. These topics were all focused on actionable items that each and every operation can impact as we move forward in the new year. 
In depth, we discussed our routing and scheduling and how it saves miles, improved margin and helps to reduce our carbon footprint. Next, we discussed our launch of the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI initiative that John mentioned earlier. Premium did an excellent job sharing how a more diverse group will help lead our decision-making in the future. And in Gary spent time and discussed our safety journey and how this positively impacts our workforce and our financial performance. The advantage of hosting these sessions online, and yes, I am looking for silver linings here is that we can a chance to read comments in real-time as this taper is leading the session. 
There was a very positive energy around all of these topics and others that will support our sustainability for years to come. 
Let's take a look-through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase to 6% included 1.5% from acquisitions and the remaining 4.5% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 11%; commercial, excluding fumigation -- commercial pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down 0.3%; and termite and ancillary services, which made approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 8.7%. One item of note is that our wildlife service grew at their fastest rate since Q1 of 2018. 
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 4.5%. And from that, residential was up 9.3%; commercial, ex-fumigation decreased 2.4%; and termite and ancillary grew by 8.4%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. 
The total gross margin increased to 50.3% from 49.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. These gains were offset by higher materials and supplies costs related to our personal protective equipment inventory. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $203,000 to $22.4 million, a decrease of 0.4%. Depreciation decreased $57,000 and amortization of intangible assets decreased $148,000 as intangibles from previous acquisitions, such as Hometeam and Western, became fully amortized. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $159.1 million or 29.7% of revenues. This was down 2.9% compared to 2019, and the quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits and lower bad debt through better collection efforts. 
As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2020, we spent $147.4 million on acquisitions compared to $430.6 million the same period last year, which included our initial [indiscernible] pest control acquisition. We paid $160.5 million on dividends and had $23.2 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We've ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which, $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. These numbers all include our reduction in debt of $88.5 million for the year. 
As you may remember, we kicked off the reporting of our ESG activities at the beginning of the year in 2020 with our first ever 2019 sustainability report. In March of 2021, we will produce our second edition, which will include more updates and goals in the areas that will impact our company over the next 5 years. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which was a 50% increase on the pre-split numbers from last year, that will be paid on March 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2021. 
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

As people were to return, will that reduce to the bid, I think that's kind of yet to be seen at this point. The positive for us is -- and Gerry talked about this, is the sale of our mosquito product. As we continue to do that, that product continues to grow at a 30%-plus clip on a growing base. And probably the exciting thing for me is that we've really expanded the opportunity for growth with this particular -- with this particular service to many of our different brands. So early on, we had a few of our brands that really were concentrating on this, and this has really expanded to others. So we believe this is going to be a good residential opportunity for us as we move forward.

We continue to add new geographies internationally. We continue to add new companies as we did most recently in Australia to our international operations. But our percent of our international to our total continues to hover around that same 7% or 8%, no matter what we do internationally because of the growth that we have in the U.S. Those numbers have kind of stayed intact. And I would just use that analogy, Michael, to kind of say we're kind of doing the same thing here. So we're adding a significant number of new customers, but, at the same time, we are adding new services to existing customers. So as much as we continue to look for those penetration opportunities, it's a good problem to have that, that number necessarily isn't improving significantly as far as those that have more than 1 service because we are adding new customers each and every quarter. 
So we'll continue -- once we have our foot in the door to continue to add those new services. And as we've shared on this call before, any time we have more than 1 service, the likelihood of that customer retaining and staying with us is significantly higher. So we'll continue to pursue that on that second or third or more services, but we're also happy on the new customer growth as well."

The things that I would say are most impactful were Q -- end of Q1 into Q2, with our headwind of materials and supplies that occurred in 2010, that we feel will not be a headwind as we're moving through 2021 based on everything that we know today. We feel like that we have made those purchases. 
As we talked about in Q3, we actually had to write-down our inventory. Because, in Q2, we purchased at a very high price, in some cases, to be able to get that protective equipment in place, which was the right thing to do at the time to continue to move our business forward. But we feel as though that will be a good tailwind for us, especially as we move Q2, Q3, Q4. 
And I would say, on the residential side, Mario already asked the question on what that looks like for it. Q1, we really don't have a comp for that because really, things didn't go south with us there until the end of March. But I think the stay at home from there will continue to be a play and will continue to drive demand as well as the continued concentration on the other of the services that we talked about. And I would think that incrementally, we may see a little bit more of a headwind on that as we move to Q3 and to Q4 of 2021. However, the offset of that would be, if things are getting back to normal and if people are going back to work, that would mean that the commercial product should, in fact, be going the other way. The commercial product should be improving incrementally as we move Q2 into Q3 into Q4 when we look at this year-over-year. 
So for all those times, when we had investors ask us why we didn't concentrate only on the commercial product? And I said I was very happy with the with the different products that we had to be able to sell because of diversification, I think, Michael, we're going to see a little bit of that as we move through this, that if, in fact, the stay-at-home does kind of subside some, then the commercial should see good improvements as we move forward.

We're especially proud of our employee's dedication and adaptability through this difficult year.
They've continued to provide vital services to our customers through very challenging situations, enabling the continuation of our long-term success. Our people are truly our most important asset as they protect our customers' property, health and peace of mind. We're extremely appreciative of their efforts during this unprecedented time.
At Rollins, we also have an unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe. This has never been more important than this past year, where we faced the threat of the COVID-19 virus. New stringent safety protocols were promptly created, and even today remain a priority, while we continue to have employed health risks from the virus. 
As a result of working safely through the pandemic, we've also benefited from the trust we have built with our customers. This was confirmed by the strong performance that we had in our residential services segment. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our business and the importance of the service we provided.
Before I wrap up, on behalf of the entire team at Rollins, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our 2 retiring directors, Jimmy Williams, who joined the Board in 1978; and Bill Dismuke, who joined the Board in 1984. Their insightful guidance and service to the company has been invaluable, and we wish them well in their retirement.

Year-over-year commercial revenue was down as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the COVID virus due to varying levels of government-driven shutdowns. 
However, we have continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April, with fourth quarter commercial growth only 0.6% below last year. We are pleased with the steady progress we have achieved under these circumstances. I am very proud of our team and the commitment they show each day to take care of our customers. Their dedication and determination were very evident this year as they added many thousands of customers during a challenging time. We believe our fourth quarter and 2020 full year results reflect both the resilience of our company and our people. 
I would now like to take a moment to talk about Rollins' ESG, or environmental, social and governance, commitment. We hold ourselves accountable to a high standard of sustainability, social responsibility and good corporate governance. ESG is not just an important part of our business, it's become part of our culture.
We also have launched diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiative, internally focused on advancing the culture of inclusion where all employees feel respected and treated fairly with an equitable opportunity to excel. This effort is sponsored by Freeman Elliott, our Orkin U.S. President. Freeman is working in close partnership with the newly formed Advisory Council made up of employees from across all brands to drive DEI improvements. The council is actively reviewing all policies, conducting campaign awareness, creating listening forums and providing training with much more to come. We're committed to this vision and the journey we will all take together. 
I'm also pleased to note that we have further strengthened our Board of Directors, adding to an already experienced and strong Board with the additions of Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Jerry Nix. As background, both Susan Bell and Patrick Gunning have recently retired from distinguished careers in public accounting, 36 and 39 years, respectively. Both are qualified as financial experts for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission public companies. Jerry Nix comes to our Board as the former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Genuine Parts Company. They are all seasoned executives and accomplished leaders and their diverse experience will be invaluable to help shape Rollins' future. 
Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our business."

Although I've been with Rollins company since 1999 and have had the opportunity over the years to interact with many of the investors on today's call, this is my first time speaking with you as Chief Operating Officer. I do so with a strong sense of responsibility to our company, our employees, our customers and our shareholders. I'm excited to be here.
I would also like to thank all of our colleagues for the smooth transition over the last few months and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through the execution of our business strategy. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand the company's presence not only in the U.S., but yet globally as well. We added 10 strategic acquisitions within the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore. We are very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins' family brands. And as we enter 2021, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business.
This past week, we completed our first virtual company-wide leadership meeting with all our top leaders across all our global business units. While we miss being in the same room together, we still found an opportunity to gather on Zoom for productive discussions on items that will be critical for our success in 2021. As an example, one focus area we discussed that has been significant to our growth is mosquito service. This continues to be an excellent add-on service for many customers and an increase greater than 30% over the prior year. We know this will continue to be a great opportunity in 2021.
As we have discussed in the past, mosquito-borne diseases continue to be an increasing threat around the world, and as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. The overall emphasis of our leadership meeting was about executing our plans in 2021, and I have great confidence in our leadership team to make this happen.
Now, let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials."

The obstacles that impacted Q2 and Q3 continued to decrease throughout the quarter, and our operations and nonoperations groups continue to make tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. We're utilizing mostly remote workforces, which has forced us to continue to evaluate processes and become more efficient. These changes have made us a better company. We're also thankful that we have invested in technology the way that we have over the last 4 to 5 years. 
Dealing with the increased demand on the residential side of our business and the disruption to routes on the commercial side of our business would have been an extreme challenge to handle without these tools in place.
For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included: a fourth year in a row of metric improvement through our routing and scheduling initiatives; safety improvements that translated to expense reductions; and successful, continued cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year.
As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP financials for the quarter and GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the full year that were impacted by accelerated vesting of shares in the third quarter of this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins books in 2019.
Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $536.3 million was an increase of 6% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $506 million. Our income before income taxes was $86.9 million or 20.7% above 2019. Net income was $62.6 million, up 23.4% compared to 2019. Our EPS were $0.13 per diluted share.
Looking at the full year, revenue of $2.161 billion was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's revenue of $2.015 billion. Our GAAP income before taxes was $354.7 million or 35.8% above 2019. Our net income was $260.8 million, up 28.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.53 per diluted share.
For the full year, looking at our non-GAAP financials, taking into account the accelerated stock vesting that occurred in the third quarter of this year, and the pension plan moving off of our books in 2019, income before taxes was $361.4 million and was up 16 2%. And net income was $267.5 million this year compared to $229.9 million in 2019, a 16.3% increase. And our non-GAAP EPS were $0.54 compared to $0.47, which is a 14.9% improvement.
Jerry mentioned our 2021 leadership meeting. And while our gathering online instead of in-person looked different than the previous years, our focus on messaging and alignment for the year to come continue to be the same. One of the sessions over the 3 days was entitled, ""Items To Make You Successful in 2021."" During this segment, we discussed several different topics that will impact our journey of sustainability through environmental, social and governance, or ESG. These topics were all focused on actionable items that each and every operation can impact as we move forward in the new year.
In depth, we discussed our routing and scheduling and how it saves miles, improves margin and helps to reduce our carbon footprint. Next, we discussed our launch of the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiative that John mentioned earlier. Freeman did an excellent job sharing how a more diverse group will help lead our decision-making in the future. And then Jerry spent time and discussed our safety journey and how this positively impacts our workforce and our financial performance. The advantage of hosting these sessions online, and yes, I am looking for silver linings here, is that we get a chance to read comments in real-time as the speaker is leading the session. There was a very positive energy around all of these topics and others that will support our sustainability for years to come.
Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 6% included 1.5% from acquisitions and the remaining 4.5% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 11%; commercial, excluding fumigation, commercial pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down 0.5%; and termite and ancillary services, which made approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 8.7%. One item of note is that our wildlife service grew at their fastest rate since Q1 of 2018.
Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4.5%. And from that, residential was up 9.3%; commercial, ex fumigation, decreased 2.4%; and termite and ancillary grew by 8.4%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world.
In total, gross margin increased to 50.3% from 49.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. These gains were offset by higher materials and supplies costs related to our personal protective equipment inventory. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $203,000 to $22.4 million, a decrease of 0.9%. Depreciation decreased $57,000 and amortization of intangible assets decreased $148,000 as intangibles from previous acquisitions, such as Hometeam and Western, became fully amortized. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $159.1 million or 29.7% of revenues. This was down 2.9% compared to 2019, and the quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits and lower bad debt through better collection efforts.
As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2020, we spent $147.4 million on acquisitions compared to $430.6 million the same period last year, which included our initial Clark Pest Control acquisition. We paid $160.5 million on dividends and had $23.2 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We've ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which, $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. These numbers all include our reduction in debt of $88.5 million for the year. 
As you may remember, we kicked off the reporting of our ESG activities at the beginning of the year in 2020 with our first ever 2019 sustainability report. In March of 2021, we will produce our second edition, which will include more updates and goals in the areas that will impact our company over the next 5 years.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which was a 50% increase on the pre-split numbers from last year, that will be paid on March 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2021.

We continue to have good positive momentum, as we talked about a couple of times, having to do with our routing and scheduling, and we'll continue to see and reap the benefits of that. And I think, to your point of the density, as commercial were to continue to incrementally get better as we're all hoping as we move through 2021, that density will improve and make those improvements potentially even better.

As people were to return, will that reduce to the bid, I think that's kind of yet to be seen at this point. The positive for us is -- and Jerry talked about this, is the sale of our mosquito product. As we continue to do that, that product continues to grow at a 30%-plus clip on a growing base. And probably the exciting thing for me is that we've really expanded the opportunity for growth with this particular service to many of our different brands.

And I would just use that analogy, Michael, to kind of say we're kind of doing the same thing here. So we're adding a significant number of new customers. But, at the same time, we are adding new services to existing customers. So as much as we continue to look for those penetration opportunities, it's a good problem to have that, that number necessarily isn't improving significantly as far as those that have more than one service because we are adding new customers each and every quarter.
So we'll continue once we have our foot in the door to continue to add those new services. And as we've shared on this call before, any time we have more than one service, the likelihood of that customer retaining and staying with us is significantly higher. So we'll continue to pursue that on that second or third or more services, but we're also happy on the new customer growth as well."

But we feel as though that will be a good tailwind for us, especially as we move Q2, Q3, Q4.
I would say, on the residential side, Mario already asked the question on what that looks like for it. Q1, we really don't have a comp for that because really things didn't go south with us there until the end of March. But I think the stay-at-home from there will continue to be a play and will continue to drive demand as well as the continued concentration on the other of the services that we talked about. And I would think that incrementally, we may see a little bit more of a headwind on that as we move to Q3 and to Q4 of 2021. 
However, the offset of that would be, if things are getting back to normal and if people are going back to work, that would mean that the commercial product should, in fact, be going the other way. The commercial product should be improving incrementally as we move Q2 into Q3 into Q4 when we look at this year-over-year.
So for all those times, when we had investors ask us why we didn't concentrate only on the commercial product? I said I was very happy with the different products that we had to be able to sell because of diversification. I think, Michael, we're going to see a little bit of that as we move through this, that if, in fact, the stay-at-home does kind of subside some, then the commercial should see good improvements as we move forward. Does that help?"

I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize [ Henry Tippy ] for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years. As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippy recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers. Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company. During his distinguished career, not only was Henry, our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins purchase of Orkin in 1964. Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leverage buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School. Henry, along with [ Randall Rollins ], our Chairman at the time, were the only 2 Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968 and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary. Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders. Randall Rollins was inducted as well. Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions. On behalf of the entire Rollins family of employees, thank you, Henry. We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided. 
I'd also like to acknowledge [ Lee Cromp's ] recent retirement from Rollins as Chief Information Officer. Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team. He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future. We wish Lee all the best in his retirement. He's earned it. 
In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day. They have risen again to the occasion going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before. We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year. They truly are our most valuable asset. 
While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance. I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year.

Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials. 
It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively. Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continue this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020. 
Next, I, too, would like to acknowledge the notable impact Mr. Tippy has made, not only on our company but with me, as well. I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member. While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished Executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months. Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nicks, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Sykes. They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward. 
We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations. Jerry Nicks was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee. He is also now serving as a member of our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee. Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees. Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee. 
As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires. Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh. While we have spent the last 6 months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology. Thomas is extremely qualified having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years. And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position. 
Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our businesses."

The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines. And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and Termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced. Commercial, ex-fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020. This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020. Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding. We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment. 
Turning to our mosquito service. As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business. For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%. Additionally, the strength of our Termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future. 
Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands. We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia. Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry. 
Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Tru Tech and Critter Control brands. Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations. 
Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services. As part of our approach, in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS on 2 additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services. With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes. Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time. Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands. 
Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021.

I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippy's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company. 
For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, Termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board. 
As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties. As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties. Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases. The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter. 
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020. And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share. When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020. 
This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts. As we move from what we would call Stage 2 to Stage 3 of our 5-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience. 
Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive. Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule. If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer. This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs. These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%. Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%. Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. 
Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9% and from residential was up 12.8%. commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%, and Termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020. We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021. 
In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. 
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%. Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues. This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. 
There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021. At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins. 
As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest 3 expense areas. At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency. Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven. 
Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees. As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year. We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020. We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021.

The good news for us, and I'll kind of move to specifically your question, the good news for us is as our technology continues to mature on the routing and scheduling part, it enables us to automatically be more efficient. So during my prepared remarks, I talked about, let's just say, a technician that maybe went out with 9 stops in a day and then at 10:00 in the morning, someone called and said, well, they're not going to be available and not be home at 2:00. In our old world, that 2:00 slot basically would have gone empty and the technician would not have had anything to do. In this new world, the branch can see that in real time, our call center can see that in real time. So now when we have a new customer, we can slot a new customer into that time slide. So it's enabling us to continue to be more efficient with that, which is helping with that demand, with the new customer and also being able to move that existing customer as well. 
So with all that being said, with these demand levels, we are absolutely having issues to be able to go through and make sure that we're finding it and hiring the folks that we need to be able to keep the business moving forward. And HR group and the operations groups are doing a tremendous job with that. But it is a battle with the other companies that are out there that are offering some of the things that you've talked about."

I talked again, in my prepared remarks, we did have good weather that we're up against that created. But I think the essential worker status and the seriousness that we took with that, especially as the pandemic started, to me, I think, is one of the things that separated us, for sure, in the service industry, and I would say, separated us within our pest control industry as well. 
So we already had a very professional technician. As we've talked about previously, we invested in PPE very early on. And when you combine that together with that trusted person that you already have, we believe that, that separated us potentially from others that are out there. We've all had people in different service industries that maybe showed up to do some sort of work that looked disheveled, didn't look professional. And they could have been the best person to be able to do that job that you would hope. But the impression didn't come across positively. And we believe that our technicians across the board in all of our brands come across professionally. And we believe that essential worker status really translated into a trusted brand. And as people have felt more comfortable opening their homes over this last, I'll say, 3, 4, 5 months, we believe that's translated more into a trusted brand, a trusted name, I'm open to them coming into my home and it's really been a reflection of this demand that we've seen that we've been able to go through and grow our business with. So we think that those are a few things. 
When you couple that with these continued enhancements in the routing and scheduling and how our communication with our customers continues to improve, we believe those are things that continue to separate us from the competition that's out there and enabling us to win on high demand and to retain it at a high rate."

I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize Henry Tippie for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years. As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippie recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers. Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company. 
During his distinguished career, not only was Henry our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins' purchase of Orkin in 1964. Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leveraged buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School. Henry, along with Randall Rollins, our Chairman at the time, were the only 2 Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968, and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary. Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders. Randall Rollins was inducted as well. Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions. On behalf of the entire Rollins family of employees, thank you, Henry. We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided.  
I'd also like to acknowledge Lee Crump's recent retirement from Rollins as Chief Information Officer. Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team. He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future. We wish Lee all the best in his retirement. He's earned it.  
In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day. They have risen again to the occasion, going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before. We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year. They truly are our most valuable asset.  
While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance. I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year.  
Let me now turn the call over to John."

As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results.  Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted",497,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results.  
Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials.  
It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively. Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continued this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020.  
Next, I, too, would like to acknowledge the notable impact Mr. Tippie has made, not only on our company but with me, as well. I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member. While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months. Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nix, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Cynkus. They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward.  
We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations. Jerry Nix was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee. He is also now serving as a member on our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee. Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees. Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee.  
As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires. Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh. While we have spent the last 6 months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology. Thomas is extremely qualified, having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years. And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position.  
Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our businesses."

And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and",480,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody.  
The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines. And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced. Commercial, ex fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020. This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020. Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding. We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment.  
Turning to our mosquito service. As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business. For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%. Additionally, the strength of our termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future.  
Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands. We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia. Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry.  
Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Trutech and Critter Control brands. Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations.  
Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services. As part of our approach in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS in 2 additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services. With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes. Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time. Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands.  
Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience.  
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021.  
Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials."
300753,710394550,2260849,"Rollins, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jerry. I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. The results of this quarter are",1015,"Thank you, Jerry. I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company.  
For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board.  
As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties. As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties. Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases. The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter.  
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020. And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share. When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020.  
This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts. As we move from what we would call Stage 2 to Stage 3 of our 5-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience.  
Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive. Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule. If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer. This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs. These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter.  
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%. Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%. Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth.  
Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9%, and from that, residential was up 12.8%; commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%; and termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020. We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021.  
In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies.  
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%. Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues. This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. 
There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021. At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins. 
As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest 3 expense areas. At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency. Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven. 
Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees. As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year. We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020. We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021.

Great. And then just my follow-up would be on the labor market. You guys actually said that you're seeing labor efficiencies and you're seeing, I guess, maybe savings there or coming in better than expected. And I think commentary from other companies is that they're seeing difficulty in hiring new labor, essentially competing with the government for people looking for jobs with stimulus and unemployment checks. Are you seeing anything similar to that within your new hires? And we've also heard that, I guess, smaller pest companies are even offering bonuses to new hires that they sign and then they work for the first 30 days or 60 days or whatever it is and they'll get an additional bonus for staying with them. Are you doing something similar? Or is that really not in the cards for you?"

The good news for us, and I'll kind of move to specifically your question, the good news for us is as our technology continues to mature on the routing and scheduling part, it enables us to automatically be more efficient. So during my prepared remarks, I talked about, let's just say, a technician that maybe went out with 9 stops in a day and then at 10:00 in the morning, someone called and said, well, they're not going to be available and not be home at 2:00. In our old world, that 2:00 slot basically would have gone empty and the technician would not have had anything to do. In this new world, the branch can see that in real time, our call center can see that in real time. So now when we have a new customer, we can slot a new customer into that time slot. So it's enabling us to continue to be more efficient with that, which is helping with that demand, with the new customer and also being able to move that existing customer as well. 
So with all that being said, with these demand levels, we are absolutely having issues to be able to go through and make sure that we're finding it and hiring the folks that we need to be able to keep the business moving forward. And HR group and the operations groups are doing a tremendous job with that. But it is a battle with the other companies that are out there that are offering some of the things that you've talked about."

So the conversation about growth, and I get you're not doing anything different in the language of significant. But double-digit or very high single-digit organic growth in residential relative to the underlying market growth is phenomenal. So what are you doing different that you're producing that type of organic growth versus anybody else in the business because you're clearly gaining share in your well-run company.

And trust me, as we've gone through this time of these higher demand levels, we've continued to really drill down into that to get a better understanding. I talked again in my prepared remarks, we did have good weather that we're up against that created. But I think the essential worker status and the seriousness that we took with that, especially as the pandemic started, to me, I think, is one of the things that separated us, for sure, in the service industry, and I would say, separated us within our pest control industry as well. 
So we already had a very professional technician. As we've talked about previously, we invested in PPE very early on. And when you combine that together with that trusted person that you already have, we believe that, that separated us potentially from others that are out there. We've all had people in different service industries that maybe showed up to do some sort of work that looked disheveled, didn't look professional. And they could have been the best person to be able to do that job that you would hope. But the impression didn't come across positively. And we believe that our technicians across the board in all of our brands come across professionally. And we believe that essential worker status really translated into a trusted brand. And as people have felt more comfortable opening their homes over this last, I'll say, 3, 4, 5 months, we believe that's translated more into a trusted brand, a trusted name, I'm open to them coming into my home and it's really been a reflection of this demand that we've seen that we've been able to go through and grow our business with. So we think that those are a few things. 
When you couple that with these continued enhancements in the routing and scheduling and how our communication with our customers continues to improve, we believe those are things that continue to separate us from the competition that's out there and enabling us to win on high demand and to retain it at a high rate."

As Orkin begins their 120th year of service, we thought it was an opportune time to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the recent successes of the brand. 
For those who have followed us over the years, you may recall that Orkin was acquired by Rollins in 1964. And as the original company, that first started our venture into pest control. Today, Orkin remains our largest brand, employing over 8,000 team members and completing millions of services annually worldwide. Orkin is very involved in the communities they serve, maintaining a strong commitment to education, public health and environmental responsibility. From collaborations with the centers for disease control and prevention and major universities, to their work with the National Science Teachers Association, work and fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world around us. 
As we have previously shared with you over the past few years, Orkin has adopted new technologies, which has improved communications with customers, optimized routing and scheduling and increased technician efficiencies to name a few. Through the years, Orkin has grown adding both new customers and new customer service offerings like Bedbug, Flea and Tick, Mosquito and most recently, Vital Clean, our service designed to fight COVID-19. 
Overall, Orkin has significantly contributed to the long-term success of Rollins. As Gary mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with our results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 15.3% to $63.2 million compared to $553.3 million for the second quarter of last year. Net income grew to $98.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $75.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. 
Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 13.6% and termite 16.3% over second quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 17.4% growth over second quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 11.3% growth over 2 years ago when we weren't experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. 
As you may recall, last year, we thought it was prudent to forgo our annual price increase during the pandemic. Now encouraged by the economic recovery that's underway, we have rolled out our 2021 annual price increases at all our brands. Implemented at the end of the second quarter, we expect that we will see the benefits of these increases as we move throughout the remainder of the year. 
Additionally, we're especially pleased with our commercial pest control growth, which has not only benefited from the economy reopening, but also from our InSite commercial technology. Through the use of InSite, Orkin's web reporting tool, our commercial customers have the ability to monitor pest activity and treatments within their facilities, reduce service tickets and receive specific pest alert notifications. This allows for quality assurance checks to be easily completed at the customer level. It also gives the customer the ability to produce timely reporting as necessary for regulatory or third-party audits. We get great feedback from customers on InSite and are confident that this feature will strengthen our relationships with commercial clients. 
Overall, we've made strong progress during the first 6 months of 2021. And as we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and profitability in our business. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials."
300753,1673197917,2352721,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jerry. At Rollins, we are constantly looking for ways to improve in all areas of our business. As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture.

As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture. We have a lot of opportunity for the remainder of 2021. But I would like to recognize that the significant financial gains from this quarter are on top of the strong gains that we experienced during 2020. Even as we were all entering a different economic time back in Q2 of last year, our revenue grew at a steady 5.6%, and that was converted into net income growth of 17.2%. Both of these 2020 numbers were at or above our historic averages. So for the second quarter 2021, as Jerry noted, all business lines presented strong revenue growth. Keys to the quarter included pricing strength, positively impacting revenue growth, continued mosquito service revenue improvement over 30% and commercial pest control revenue improving significantly. Additionally, for the first time, our mosquito service revenue has surpassed our bed bug revenue in this quarter was over 3% of our total revenue. 
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $638.2 million was an increase of 15.3% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $553.3 million. Our income before income taxes was $133.9 million or 29.4% above 2020. Our net income was $98.9 million, up [ 31.2% ] compared to 2020. Our earnings per share were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in 2020 or a 33.3% increase. 
As a reminder, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the first quarter of 2021. The non-GAAP results were positively impacted by our gain on sales of several of our properties. For the first 6 months of 2021, revenues were $1.174 billion, which was an increase of 12.7% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $1.014 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $253.8 million or 59.7% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $191.5 million or 61.4% compared to 2020. Our GAAP EPS or earnings per [indiscernible] revenue growth of 5.6% in 2020, followed by a healthy increase of 15.3% in 2021. It does not seem that pent-up demand or stimulus checks have impacted our residential revenue growth, but rather a new awareness of pest needs based on more time spent at the home. It would be difficult to predict what these new demand levels will look like in the future, but we remain optimistic. 
Our total revenue increased for the quarter, up 15.3% and include 1.7% from significant acquisitions with the remaining 13.6% from pricing and new customer growth. Residential pest control made up 40% of our revenue, commercial pest control 33%, and termite and other services made up approximately 21% of our revenue. In addition, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. Again, total revenue less significant acquisitions was up 13.6% from that, Residential was up 12.3%, commercial, excluding fumigation, increased 14.8% and termite and ancillary grew by 14.9%. In total, our gross margin decreased to 53.3% from 53.8% in the prior year's quarter. improvements were made in total payroll, but were negatively offset by higher overall fleet costs and a write-down of inventory of $2.7 million related to our PPE or personal protective equipment. We will continue to assess our fluctuating future needs and market value for our PPE in the coming quarters. 
In addition to our continued Orkin U.S. mileage savings, our Orkin Canada and Western Pest brands are making progress regarding their BOSS and routing and scheduling implementation. Each company has improved their on-day and on-time delivery since the project started. These savings will help support improvements in our overall fleet cost in the future quarters. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.4 million to $23.3 million, an increase of 6.3%. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.3 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Service in December 2020 and Adams Pest in Australia in July of last year. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses presented a 7.1% improvement for the quarter over 2020, decreasing from 30.9% of revenues to 28.7% of revenues in 2021. The quarter produced savings in administrative and sales salaries and benefits as well as telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. 
As for our cash position, for the 6 months ending [ 6/30/2021 ], we spent $28.4 million on acquisitions compared to $56 million in the same period last year. We paid $79.7 million on dividends and had $13.2 million of CapEx compared to $12.4 million in 2020. We ended the period with $128.5 million in cash, of which $73.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Before I close out, I would like to mention our recent press release, where Rollins was named to the top 50 green fleet list as pushed by Automotive Fleets 2021 ranking. As part of our continuous improvement that I mentioned in my opening, we have lots of opportunity in the future in this area, but we are proud of this recognition by the industry. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 10, 2021.

As detailed in our May press releases, Greg was the former Chief Information Officer, who led the information technology operations for Cox Enterprises, and he will add cyber expertise to our Board. Don, having worked for many years in investment in commercial banking, including Wachovia Bank, brings a high level of knowledge and strategic financial transactions to the company. We're thrilled to add these individuals to the outstanding group of leaders on our Board, and we look forward to their counsel and contributions to our company. 
Now I will turn the call over to Jerry to provide an overview of the strong quarter just completed."

As Orkin begins their 120th year of service, we thought it was an opportune time to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the recent successes of the brand.  For those who have followed us over the years, yo",566,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. As Orkin begins their 120th year of service, we thought it was an opportune time to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the recent successes of the brand.  
For those who have followed us over the years, you may recall that Orkin was acquired by Rollins in 1964 and as the original company, that first started our venture into pest control. Today, Orkin remains our largest brand, employing over 8,000 team members and completing millions of services annually worldwide. Orkin is very involved in the communities they serve, maintaining a strong commitment to education, public health and environmental responsibility. 
From collaborations with the centers for disease control and prevention and major universities to their work with the National Science Teachers Association, Orkin fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world around us.  
As we have previously shared with you over the past few years, Orkin has adopted new technologies, which has improved communications with customers, optimized routing and scheduling and increased technician efficiencies to name a few. Through the years, Orkin has grown adding both new customers and new customer service offerings like bed bug, flea and tick, mosquito and most recently, VitalClean, our service designed to fight COVID-19. Overall, Orkin has significantly contributed to the long-term success of Rollins. 
As Gary mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with our results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 15.3% to $63.2 million compared to $553.3 million for the second quarter of last year. Net income grew to $98.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $75.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. 
For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 13.6% and termite, 16.3% over second quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 17.4% growth over second quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 11.3% growth over 2 years ago when we weren't experiencing COVID-related shutdowns.  
As you may recall, last year, we thought it was prudent to forgo our annual price increase during the pandemic. Now encouraged by the economic recovery that's underway, we have rolled out our 2021 annual price increases at all our brands. Implemented at the end of the second quarter, we expect that we will see the benefits of these increases as we move throughout the remainder of the year.  
Additionally, we're especially pleased with our commercial pest control growth, which has not only benefited from the economy reopening, but also from our InSite commercial technology. Through the use of InSite, Orkin's web reporting tool, our commercial customers have the ability to monitor pest activity and treatments within their facilities, reduce service tickets and receive specific pest alert notifications. This allows for quality assurance checks to be easily completed at the customer level. It also gives the customer the ability to produce timely reporting as necessary for regulatory or third-party audits. We get great feedback from customers on InSite and are confident that this feature will strengthen our relationships with commercial clients.  
Overall, we've made strong progress during the first 6 months of 2021. And as we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and profitability in our business. 
Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials."
300753,1673197917,2352833,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jerry. At Rollins, we are constantly looking for ways to improve in all areas of our business. As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture. We have a lot of opportunity for the remainder of 2021. But I would",912,"Thank you, Jerry. At Rollins, we are constantly looking for ways to improve in all areas of our business. As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture. We have a lot of opportunity for the remainder of 2021. But I would like to recognize that the significant financial gains from this quarter are on top of the strong gains that we experienced during 2020. 
Even as we were all entering a different economic time back in Q2 of last year, our revenue grew at a steady 5.6%. That was converted into net income growth of 17.2%. Both of these 2020 numbers were at or above our historic averages. So for the second quarter 2021, as Jerry noted, all business lines presented strong revenue growth. Keys to the quarter included pricing strength, positively impacting revenue growth, continued mosquito service revenue improvement over 30% and commercial pest control revenue improving significantly. Additionally, for the first time, our mosquito service revenue has surpassed our bedbug revenue in this quarter was over 3% of our total revenue.  
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $638.2 million was an increase of 15.3% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $553.3 million. Our income before income taxes was $133.9 million, or 29.4% above 2020. Our net income was $98.9 million, up 31.2% compared to 2020. Our earnings per share were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in 2020, or a 33.3% increase.  
As a reminder, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the first quarter of 2021. The non-GAAP results were positively impacted by our gain on sales of several of our properties. For the first 6 months of 2021, revenues were $1.174 billion, which was an increase of 12.7% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $1.014 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $253.8 million, or 59.7% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $191.5 million, or 61.4%, compared to 2020. Our GAAP EPS or earnings per were $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in 2020. 
Overall, like some companies that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, demand in most areas of our business in both 2020 and 2021 was strong. We maintained consistent revenue growth of 5.6% in 2020, followed by a healthy increase of 15.3% in 2021. It does not seem that pent-up demand or stimulus checks have impacted our residential revenue growth, but rather a new awareness of pest needs based on more time spent at the home. It would be difficult to predict what these new demand levels will look like in the future, but we remain optimistic.  
Our total revenue increased for the quarter, up 15.3% and included 1.7% from significant acquisitions with the remaining 13.6% from pricing and new customer growth. Residential pest control made up 40% of our revenue; commercial pest control, 33%; and termite and other services made up approximately 21% of our revenue. In addition, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. 
Again, total revenue less significant acquisitions, was up 13.6%. From that, residential was up 12.3%; commercial, excluding fumigation, increased 14.8%; and termite and ancillary grew by 14.9%. In total, our gross margin decreased to 53.3% from 53.8% in the prior year's quarter. Improvements were made in total payroll but were negatively offset by higher overall fleet costs and a write-down of inventory of $2.7 million related to our PPE, or personal protective equipment. We will continue to assess our fluctuating future needs and market value for our PPE in the coming quarters.  
In addition to our continued Orkin U.S. mileage savings, our Orkin Canada and Western Pest brands are making progress regarding their BOSS and routing and scheduling implementation. Each company has improved their on-day and on-time delivery since the project started. These savings will help support improvements in our overall fleet cost in the future quarters. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.4 million to $23.3 million, an increase of 6.3%. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.3 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Service in December 2020 and Adams Pest in Australia in July of last year.  
Sales, general and administrative expenses presented a 7.1% improvement for the quarter over 2020, decreasing from 30.9% of revenues to 28.7% of revenues in 2021. The quarter produced savings in administrative and sales salaries and benefits as well as telephone savings from better negotiated contracts.  
As for our cash position, for the 6 months ending 6/30/2021, we spent $28.4 million on acquisitions compared to $56 million in the same period last year. We paid $79.7 million on dividends and had $13.2 million of CapEx compared to $12.4 million in 2020. We ended the period with $128.5 million in cash, of which $73.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.  
Before I close out, I would like to mention our recent press release, where Rollins was named to the top 50 green fleet list as pushed by Automotive Fleets 2021 ranking. As part of our continuous improvement that I mentioned in my opening, we have lots of opportunity in the future in this area, but we are proud of this recognition by the industry. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 10, 2021. 
Gary, I'll turn it back to you."

We wish Gary well with his physical therapy and look forward to having him rejoin us on future calls. 
During the third quarter, we achieved some very strong business results, and Jerry will go over those with you shortly. In the interim, I wanted to share news of the latest addition to our Rollins Board of Directors. As you already know, over the previous year, we have enhanced and diversified that group with several new members. I am very pleased to announce our latest addition is Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer, Jerry Gahlhoff. This is in recognition of his strong leadership and his deep commitment to the company's long-term success. We are proud to have Jerry serving on our Board moving forward. 
Jerry is an important part of the Rollins leadership team, and his in-depth knowledge of our business and experience gained from working in our industry since 1991 adds perspective. We're fortunate to have him assume a greater role in the direction and future of our company. 
Before turning the call over to Jerry, I have 2 items to first update you on. The first will represent a recent development in Rollins' environmental, social and governance commitment. We take very seriously the responsibility that we have to the communities in which we work and live. As a recent example, we're pleased to share that Rollins has made an in-kind donation originally costing $4.6 million worth of Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, items during the third quarter. Working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and several philanthropic organizations, including the Friends of Disabled Adults and Children, the Foundation of Hope Food Bank as well as Cope Preparedness in Los Angeles, we donated 27 pallets or 6.8 million pieces of masks, gloves and other items. 
In addition to achieving the successful execution of our strategies as well as solid business results, we also have a responsibility to the communities in which we work and live. EFC is a facet of our business is becoming more and more important to us. We are proud to support these initiatives. 
Last, as we have previously disclosed, the company has been responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In accordance with accounting standard ASC 450, we have established a reserve related to this matter, which we consider immaterial. Given that the investigation is ongoing, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we remain focused on resolving this inquiry. 
With that, I will turn our call over to Jerry."

We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted",786,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $79.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. 
Revenues for the first 9 months of 2021 were $1.824 billion, an increase of 12.2% compared to $1.625 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased 44% to $285.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $198.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. 
For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 11.7% and termite presenting 15% growth over the third quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 10.1% growth over the third quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 7.9% growth over 2 years ago when we were not experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. Rollins remains well positioned for the remainder of the year and into 2022 
Looking deeper at our operating results, we're attracting customers to all our services and brands. And one area I'd like to focus on today is our continued strong growth in our wildlife service offerings. Trutech Wildlife joined the Rollins family in 2010, followed by Critter Control in 2015. Since 2010, the business has grown 800%. Day-to-day operations of operating a wildlife control business is quite different than running a typical pest and termite business, and we are proud to have a dedicated team focused on this much needed service. Originally concentrated in the Southeastern United States, the business has expanded across the nation as well as into Canada. And with Critter Control's expansion into Canada, it's Rollins' first brand to enter an international country without acquiring another business as a platform. 
The Wildlife division also operates a thriving franchise system. There are currently 84 franchises with the most recent franchise launching in Mansfield, Ohio. We anticipate finishing the year with 12 new franchises, one of our strongest years in adding franchisees. 
We have also been fortunate to add 9 former corporate employees as franchisees, employees who have an entrepreneurial drive and a passion for wildlife and customer service have multiple career path opportunities, be it ownership of the franchise or growth within our company. We believe there is meaningful opportunity for continued growth in our Wildlife business and look forward to updating you in the quarters ahead. 
I'd now like to discuss Hurricane Ida. Our hearts go out to our Gulf Coast region and those that were affected by the hurricane. But I must admit, we are inspired by our team in that area. They implemented an amazing plan that helped our team members and alleviate the negative impact of the storm. I have shut down several of our branches for days, but 2 locations were shut down for about 2 weeks. The impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business in the quarter. Thankfully, all of our employees in the area were safe, yet they did need assistance. Through the Rollins Employee Relief Fund, we granted 137 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first week following the hurricane to enable employees to address their personal essential needs. Since then, another 7 employees who endured greater hardships received full grants to address their more significant needs. Additionally, our Orkin South Central division, led by Leland Morris, quickly initiated a preparedness and mitigation plan to assist our team members. This included immediate procurement of much needed supplies for our employees and their families, such as generators, fuel, portable air conditioners, fans, water and other essential emergency provisions that were not readily accessible to them locally. 
Our team members in adjacent areas that were fortunate to avoid the brunt of Ida's force volunteered their time and energy, often after work hours, to load these supplies into box trucks and drive them to those most in need. For weeks, they continue to shuttle fuel to these employees to keep their generators up and running. This was a total team effort, and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to one another. In fact, we're so pleased with their effort that we plan to expand and formalize this program in other areas of the country so that we can rapidly respond in case of a natural disaster or emergency. 
Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials."
300753,1684382980,2414087,"Rollins, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarte",1060,"Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarterly moving forward. The first is a measure we have referred to periodically and that is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Due to our consistent high volume of acquisitions and hence, high amortization expense related to these acquisitions, presenting EBITDA regularly will provide a clearer picture of our operation's ongoing financial performance. Think about this, over the last 3 years, we have averaged 30 acquisitions per year. 
Next, we will begin presenting our revenue growth through both constant exchange rate and actual exchange rate. By utilizing historical baseline revenues for acquisitions betted through the due diligence process, we were able to include all acquisitions within the calculations, both stand-alone and tuck-in. This will bring clarity and consistency to both our acquisition and our organic revenue growth measurements. 
Third, we'll be providing you with our free cash flow. We believe that this will properly illustrate Rollins' strong ability to generate cash. We have taken a simple approach to defining free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of equipment and property. Our hope is that these measurements will enable investors to better assess our operating performance in the future and provide a deeper view of our business. We have included GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on each of these metrics on our earnings press release published this morning. 
So on to the numbers. Our third quarter revenues of $650.2 million was an increase of 11.4% over last year. Of the 11.4% actual exchange rate revenue growth, acquisition growth was 2.2% and organic equated to 9.2%. For the constant exchange rate, the growth percentages calculated within the hundreds of the actual exchange growth rate, therefore, presented the same. For the 9 months ended September 2021, revenues of $1.824 billion was an increase of 12.12 percentage over year-to-date 2020. Of this actual exchange rate, total revenue growth of 2 -- or excuse me, of 12.2%, 2.7% was related to acquisitions and 9.5% organic growth. The constant year-to-date exchange rate total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.6%, 2.7% represented acquisitions and 8.9% organic revenue growth. 
As Jerry pointed out, residential, commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. So in determining my focus for today, I decided to take Jerry's lead and discuss Wildlife, yet I'm discussing specifically company-owned Wildlife operations. For the third quarter in 2021, Wildlife revenues grew 24.1% over last year. And year-to-date, Wildlife has presented an overall revenue growth of 27.6%. What makes this particularly impressive is that this is after their strong growth of 20.4% last year. So similar to our residential pest control, Wildlife did not feel a negative impact to revenue growth during the pandemic. So way to go to the Wildlife team. 
Now on to our income. For the third quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the onetime super busting of our late Chairman stock grant in the third quarter of 2020 and the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first 6 months of 2021. The third quarter 2021 EBITDA was $150.9 million or 8.7% over 2020 third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $138.9 million. Third quarter 2021 EPS was $0.19 per diluted share or 5.6% improvement over the 2020 third quarter quarter adjusted EPS. For the 9 months ended September 2021, our adjusted EBITDA was $421.2 million or 22.1% over last year's adjusted EBITDA of $344.9 million. Year-to-date, 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.53 per diluted share or 26.2% over last year. 
For the third quarter 2021, gross margin increased to 53% or 0.4% over last year. Strong improvements in our materials and supplies were negatively offset by high overall fleet costs, primarily from an increase in fuel of approximately $4 million over third quarter 2020 and lower vehicle gains of $900,000 compared to last year. 
Sales, general and administrative third quarter margin increase over last year was strongly impacted by the PPE donations and the SEC accrual previously mentioned by John. Travel expenses have also increased $1.3 million in the third quarter as we have begun to lift our company travel restrictions. 
Amortization expenses for the third quarter 2021 increased $1.4 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from multiple acquisitions. This was offset by a decrease in depreciation of $201,000 due to the sale of owned vehicles and centralizing of IT function. Overall, this equated to a 5.1% increase in depreciation and amortization over the third quarter 2020. 
Our dividends paid year-to-date 2021 was $119.7 million or an increase of 30.4% over last year. We ended the current period with $117.7 million in cash, of which $73.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
So this brings us to the final of our new 3 measurements, free cash flow. For the third quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was $72.9 million or a decrease of 27.5% over the same quarter last year. For the 9 months ended 2021, our free cash flow equals $278.9 million or 13.6% decrease over year-to-date 2020. This fluctuation occurred due to the deferral of $30.3 million in FICA taxes payable in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act. These associated taxes were then remitted in September of 2021. We hope that the discussion of these new measurements, you will receive a greater clarity while reviewing our financial performance. 
Lastly, I want to discuss that yesterday, we were extremely pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 25% increase to our dividend. The quarterly dividend increased $0.10 -- to $0.10 per share from $0.08 per share and will be paid on December 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2021. Additionally, the Board also approved a special dividend of $0.08 to be paid on December 10, 2021, as well. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and underscores our financial strength, our solid capital position and the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. 
John, I'll turn it back to you."

And while he is recovering quickly, he is doing very well. He's just not in a position to physically join us today. We wish Gary well with his physical therapy and look forward to having him rejoin us on future calls.  
During the third quarter, we achieved some very strong business results, and Jerry will go over those with you shortly. In the interim, I wanted to share news of the latest addition to our Rollins Board of Directors. As you already know, over the previous year, we have enhanced and diversified that group with several new members. I am very pleased to announce our latest addition as Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer, Jerry Gahlhoff. This is in recognition of his strong leadership and his deep commitment to the company's long-term success. We are proud to have Jerry serving on our Board moving forward.  
Jerry is an important part of the Rollins leadership team, and his in-depth knowledge of our business and experience gained from working in our industry since 1991 adds perspective. We're fortunate to have him assume a greater role in the direction and future of our company.  
Before turning the call over to Jerry, I have 2 items to first update you on. The first will represent a recent development in Rollins' environmental, social and governance commitment. We take, very seriously, the responsibility that we have to the communities in which we work and live. 
As a recent example, we're pleased to share that Rollins has made an in-kind donation originally costing $4.6 million worth of Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, items during the third quarter. Working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and several philanthropic organizations, including the Friends of Disabled Adults and Children, the Foundation of Hope Food Bank as well as COPE Preparedness in Los Angeles, we donated 27 pallets or 6.8 million pieces of masks, gloves and other items.  
In addition to achieving the successful execution of our strategies as well as solid business results, we also have a responsibility to the communities in which we work and live. ESG as a facet of our business is becoming more and more important to us. We are proud to support these initiatives.  
Last, as we have previously disclosed, the company has been responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In accordance with accounting standard ASC 450, we have established a reserve related to this matter, which we consider immaterial. Given that the investigation is ongoing, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we remain focused on resolving this inquiry.  
With that, I will turn our call over to Jerry."

We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted",785,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $79.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly.  
Revenues for the first 9 months of 2021 were $1.824 billion, an increase of 12.2% compared to $1.625 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased 44% to $285.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $198.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable period last year.  
For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 11.7% and termite presenting 15% growth over the third quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 10.1% growth over the third quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 7.9% growth over 2 years ago when we were not experiencing COVID-related shutdowns.  Overall, we are pleased with our performance. Rollins remains well positioned for the remainder of the year and into 2022.
Looking deeper at our operating results, we're attracting customers to all our services and brands. And one area I'd like to focus on today is our continued strong growth in our wildlife service offerings. Trutech Wildlife joined the Rollins family in 2010, followed by Critter Control in 2015. Since 2010, the business has grown 800%. Day-to-day operations of operating a wildlife control business is quite different than running a typical pest and termite business, and we are proud to have a dedicated team focused on this much needed service. 
Originally concentrated in the Southeastern United States, the business has expanded across the nation as well as into Canada. And with Critter Control's expansion into Canada, it's Rollins' first brand to enter an international country without acquiring another business as a platform.  
The Wildlife division also operates a thriving franchise system. There are currently 84 franchises with the most recent franchise launching in Mansfield, Ohio. We anticipate finishing the year with 12 new franchises, one of our strongest years in adding franchisees.  
We have also been fortunate to add 9 former corporate employees as franchisees, employees who have an entrepreneurial drive and a passion for nuisance wildlife and customer service have multiple career path opportunities, be it ownership of the franchise or growth within our company. We believe there's meaningful opportunity for continued growth in our Wildlife business and look forward to updating you in the quarters ahead.  
I'd now like to discuss Hurricane Ida. Our hearts go out to our Gulf Coast region and those that were affected by the hurricane. But I must admit we are inspired by our team in that area. They implemented an amazing plan that helped our team members and alleviate the negative impact of the storm. 
Ida shut down several of our branches for days, but 2 locations were shut down for about 2 weeks. The impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business in the quarter. Thankfully, all of our employees in the area were safe, yet they did need assistance. 
Through the Rollins Employee Relief Fund, we granted 137 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first week following the hurricane to enable employees to address their personal essential needs. Since then, another 7 employees who endured greater hardships received full grants to address their more significant needs.
 Additionally, our Orkin South Central division, led by Leland Morris, quickly initiated a preparedness and mitigation plan to assist our team members. This included immediate procurement of much needed supplies for our employees and their families, such as generators, fuel, portable air conditioners, fans, water and other essential emergency provisions that were not readily accessible to them locally.  
Our team members in adjacent areas that were fortunate to avoid the brunt of Ida's force volunteered their time and energy, often after work hours, to load these supplies into box trucks and drive them to those most in need. For weeks, they continue to shuttle fuel to these employees to keep their generators up and running. 
This was a total team effort, and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to one another. In fact, we're so pleased with their effort that we plan to expand and formalize this program in other areas of the country so that we can rapidly respond in case of a natural disaster or emergency.  
Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials."
300753,1684382980,2414168,"Rollins, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarte",1059,"Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarterly moving forward. 
The first is a measure we have referred to periodically and that is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Due to our consistent high volume of acquisitions and hence, high amortization expense related to these acquisitions, presenting EBITDA regularly will provide a clearer picture of our operation's ongoing financial performance. Think about this, over the last 3 years, we have averaged 30 acquisitions per year.  
Next, we will begin presenting our revenue growth through both constant exchange rate and actual exchange rate. By utilizing historical baseline revenues for acquisitions vetted through the due diligence process, we were able to include all acquisitions within the calculations, both stand-alone and tuck-in. This will bring clarity and consistency to both our acquisition and our organic revenue growth measurements.  
Third, we'll be providing you with our free cash flow. We believe that this will properly illustrate Rollins' strong ability to generate cash. We have taken a simple approach to defining free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of equipment and property.  Our hope is that these measurements will enable investors to better assess our operating performance in the future and provide a deeper view of our business. We have included GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on each of these metrics on our earnings press release published this morning. 
So on to the numbers. Our third quarter revenues of $650.2 million was an increase of 11.4% over last year. Of the 11.4% actual exchange rate revenue growth, acquisition growth was 2.2% and organic equated to 9.2%. For the constant exchange rate, the growth percentage is calculated within these hundreds of the actual exchange growth rate, therefore, presented the same. 
For the 9 months ended September 2021, revenues of $1.824 billion was an increase of 12.12 percentage over year-to-date 2020. Of this actual exchange rate, total revenue growth of 2 -- or excuse me, of 12.2%, 2.7% was related to acquisitions and 9.5% organic growth. The constant year-to-date exchange rate total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.6%, 2.7% represented acquisitions and 8.9% organic revenue growth.  
As Jerry pointed out, residential, commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. So in determining my focus for today, I decided to take Jerry's lead and discuss Wildlife, yet I'm discussing specifically company-owned Wildlife operations. 
For the third quarter in 2021, Wildlife revenues grew 24.1% over last year. And year-to-date, Wildlife has presented an overall revenue growth of 27.6%. What makes this particularly impressive is that this is after their strong growth of 20.4% last year. So similar to our residential pest control, Wildlife did not feel a negative impact to revenue growth during the pandemic. So way to go to the Wildlife team.  
Now on to our income. For the third quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the onetime supervesting of our late Chairman stock grant in the third quarter of 2020 and the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first 6 months of 2021. 
The third quarter 2021 EBITDA was $150.9 million or 8.7% over 2020 third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $138.9 million. Third quarter 2021 EPS was $0.19 per diluted share or 5.6% improvement over the 2020 third quarter adjusted EPS. For the 9 months ended September 2021, our adjusted EBITDA was $421.2 million or 22.1% over last year's adjusted EBITDA of $344.9 million. Year-to-date, 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.53 per diluted share or 26.2% over last year.  
For the third quarter 2021, gross margin increased to 53% or 0.4% over last year. Strong improvements in our materials and supplies were negatively offset by high overall fleet costs, primarily from an increase in fuel of approximately $4 million over third quarter 2020 and lower vehicle gains of $900,000 compared to last year.  
Sales, general and administrative third quarter margin increase over last year was strongly impacted by the PPE donations and the SEC accrual previously mentioned by John. Travel expenses have also increased $1.3 million in the third quarter as we have begun to lift our company travel restrictions.  
Amortization expenses for the third quarter 2021 increased $1.4 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from multiple acquisitions. This was offset by a decrease in depreciation of $201,000 due to the sale of owned vehicles and centralizing of IT function. Overall, this equated to a 5.1% increase in depreciation and amortization over the third quarter 2020.  
Our dividends paid year-to-date 2021 was $119.7 million or an increase of 30.4% over last year. We ended the current period with $117.7 million in cash, of which $73.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.  
So this brings us to the final of our new 3 measurements, free cash flow. For the third quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was $72.9 million or a decrease of 27.5% over the same quarter last year. For the 9 months ended 2021, our free cash flow equals $278.9 million or 13.6% decrease over year-to-date 2020. 
This fluctuation occurred due to the deferral of $30.3 million in FICA taxes payable in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act. These associated taxes were then remitted in September of 2021. We hope that the discussion of these new measurements, you will receive a greater clarity while reviewing our financial performance. 
Lastly, I want to discuss that yesterday, we were extremely pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 25% increase to our dividends. The quarterly dividend increased $0.10 -- to $0.10 per share from $0.08 per share and will be paid on December 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2021.
Additionally, the Board also approved a special dividend of $0.08 to be paid on December 10, 2021, as well. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and underscores our financial strength, our solid capital position and the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth.  
John, I'll turn it back to you."
