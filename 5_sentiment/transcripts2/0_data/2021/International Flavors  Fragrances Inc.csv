We will begin by sharing a detailed look into our fourth quarter and the full year 2020 results and then Rustom and I will",1041,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you all who have joined us today as we close the chapter on legacy IFF and begin a new journey with N&B. We will begin by sharing a detailed look into our fourth quarter and the full year 2020 results and then Rustom and I will highlight the go-forward outlook and opportunity for the new IFF. 
I'm really excited and proud to say that as of February 1, we have officially completed our merger with DuPont N&B. Our teams have hit the ground running establishing our new company as an innovation leader in the global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. 
With the close of the N&B transaction, we also unveiled a new brand identity and purpose intended to unify our organization and best position our divisions for success. As a purpose-driven enterprise, we share a mission to build from strength and transform our industry. We are now squarely focused on execution, building on recent performance to leverage the exciting capabilities and broader customer base of our new company. I'm confident that the direction that we are moving and the opportunity ahead of us will lead to accelerated growth and improve profitability as we generate strong value creation and total shareholder return. 
Beginning with Slide 6, I would like to recap what was truly a remarkable 2020. Amid an unprecedented pandemic that challenged our global organization, we delivered solid financial results while embarking on a transformational journey to create a new industry leader together with Dupont N&B. I'm pleased to report that we completed 2020 with positive momentum on a comparable basis, and we have seen this trend continued in January 2021 as a combined company. 
In 2020, our portfolio remained resilient to an evolving and incredible challenging global environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. IFF generated USD 5.1 billion in sales for the full year 2020, about a 1% increase on a currency-neutral basis from last year when excluding the 53rd week of 2019. This sales growth was primarily driven by strong performance in our Scent division, which we believe is even better positioned to capture further market share in 2021. 
We achieved an adjusted operating margin, excluding amortization, of 18.1%, driven by our synergy efforts with Frutarom and pursuing additional productivity initiatives across the business. 
As we reflect on the integration of Frutarom, we are pleased with what we have achieved as it relates to cost synergies from procurement, manufacturing and administrative expenses. Acknowledging the revenue challenges at Frutarom over the past 2 years, we have restructured the business and, going forward, it will be an integral part of our larger new segment, including Taste, Food and Beverage segments now we have the combined combination with NMB. 
We really emphasized free cash flow management throughout the year. This led to meaningful increases year-over-year as we continued to focus on maturing our balance sheet through the pandemic. 
We finished the year with an adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $5.70. 
With the completion of our combination with DuPont N&B, we have also achieved the important milestone of completing the integration planning phase related to the merger. We are now focused on execution going forward as we are committed to realizing the meaningful synergies presented by the transaction. The capital synergy opportunity, we are encouraging collaboration across divisions and closely aligning with the markets and regions we serve to showcase the full breadth of IFF's new portfolio. I will provide further details regarding our integration initiatives a bit later. 
On Slide 7, let's take a second look at the sales dynamic that we have seen across the business. Reflecting on 2020, we were off to a very strong start, growing 6% in Q1 2020, until the pandemic had a profound impact on society and, ultimately, our business. 
Given the disruption of the year, we want to offer a bit more perspective on the trends we have seen within our business as we cover from the peak of the regulatory restrictions of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our growth rates continued to improve in the fourth quarter, up 2% excluding the 53rd week, versus the 1% year-on-year growth seen in the third quarter. A large part of this improvement came from Fine Fragrance, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter. 
As we have noted before, roughly 15% of our business was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and decreased by 16% in 2020, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. 
The vast majority of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection type products is defensive in nature or benefited from the pandemic. This was roughly 85% of our pre pandemic sales and these grew approximately 4% for the full year, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. 
Our performance was strong with multinational customers, especially those who benefited from the pandemic. However, our exposure to local and regional players adversely impacted sales. I think it's important to remember that while these smaller and regional customers were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, they have historically been an important source of growth across our industry and we expect them to be important contributors in a recovery. 
On the whole, we are proud of the results achieved and resilience of our business in 2020. Some of our end markets have seen prolonged and significant negative impact that led to inevitable headwinds for certain segments. However, when you look at the whole of our portfolio, we see strong results with meaningful momentum that affirm our central role in the consumer product good value chain. That gives me great confidence as we begin to execute as a new IFF with the N&B business in 2021. 
As we begin 2021, I'm very pleased to say we, on a combined company basis, had a strong performance in January, with approximately 3% currency-neutral growth against a strong year-ago comparison. Scent trends continued to be very strong, taste improved and N&B continued to be pressured by COVID. It is good to see that the business has had steady improvement since the pandemic lows. 
I would now like to pass the call over to Rustom, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance in the fourth quarter."

I will cover the P&L high points on this slide and get into additional detail as we go through the following several slides. 
In the fourth quarter, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, down 2% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. When excluding the roughly $50 million impact of 2019's 53rd week, our comparable currency-neutral growth was plus 2%, and as I'll explain on the next slide, up approximately 4%, counting foreign exchange-related price changes as our peers in many CPGs disclosed. 
While Taste performed at levels similar to Q3 2020, we did see a significant acceleration in Scent. 
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, decreased by 10% on a currency-neutral basis, or by 9% including a 1 percentage point benefit of FX, with solid operating performance -- operational performance offset by a challenging year-ago comparable and COVID costs. 
We delivered adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.32, mostly as a result of lower operating profit in the quarter. This was down 11% on a currency-neutral basis or 10% including the 1 percentage point benefit of FX. 
It was good to finally see foreign currency having a positive impact on sales, operating profit and EPS in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 9. I would like to focus on the emerging markets and currency impacts on our results, both in the fourth quarter and the full year, to provide better clarity regarding our currency-neutral sales growth. 
For the fourth quarter and for the full year, the impact of FX-related pricing was approximately 2 percentage points. To be clear, if we simply looked at our revenue in the current period by local currency and applied the average FX rates from the prior period to the current period, our currency-neutral growth of 2% in the fourth quarter would have been up approximately 4% and our full year currency-neutral growth of 1% would go to approximately 3%, all excluding the impact of [indiscernible]. At the segment level, Scent would have grown 10% in Q4 2020 and 7% in the full financial year. While Taste would have been up 1% in both Q4 and the full year 2020. Again, all excluding the impact of the 53rd week. 
Responding to feedback from our investors and after further review of what our competitors and other CPG companies are doing, starting in Q1 2021, we will align our reporting with our peers' methodology. For 2021, our plan is to provide this on a consolidated basis and divisional level. And before our next earnings call, we'll provide a historical restatement of growth by division for 2020. 
Moving now to Slide 10. Let me break down the key factors impacting our Q4 profitability. I do want to go into more detail on this as the overall results hide some meaningful operational improvements that support our optimism and momentum heading into 2021. 
A close look at our operating profit bridge shows that we were able to drive operational improvements, about 8%, largely attained through Frutarom synergy realization, productivity initiatives and reformulation activities, mostly in Scent; higher volumes ex the 53rd week and disciplined cost management. As expected and communicated earlier this year, there was a negative impact from our annual incentive compensation, or our AIP program reset, which was a direct result of weak Q4 2019 results. Further negative offsets came from a challenging year-to-year comparable, which included the 53rd week and the Brazilian indirect tax RSA benefit that both occurred in 2019, and in 2020, incremental COVID-19 costs which we expect will only reduce in the second half of 2021. Unfortunately, these combined items represent an 18 percentage point year-over-year headwind and were the primary driver of our 10% currency-neutral decline in operating profit. 
Now on Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our Scent division results in more detail. Another strong overall performance from Scent. Sales totaling $504 million were up 3% or 7% when excluding the 53rd week comparison. We've continued to see strong growth from our Consumer Fragrance business with a high single digit increase, driven by strong performances in our Home Care and Personal wash categories. Also, the new [ call is ] where we recently gained access in Consumer Fragrance, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 60% in the fourth quarter and represented more than 1/3 of our Consumer Fragrance growth. 
I'm also happy to share that we returned to growth in our Fine Fragrance business with a mid-single-digit increase as a result of several new wins in North America and Europe. While this was a nice development in Q4 2020, we are cautious and are not extrapolating the trend for the first quarter of 2021. 
In Fragrance Ingredients, we experienced high single-digit growth, driven by double-digit growth in Cosmetic Actives. 
So overall, the Scent division achieved a 15.9% profit margin on the $504 million of sales in the quarter. 
Our recent performance across the Scent portfolio is encouraging and will remain a core piece of our growth story moving forward, bolstered over time by expanded sales opportunities from working together with N&B. The team has done a tremendous job delivering market-leading growth, adjusted for the reporting differences over the past 3 years, while improving Scent's margin profile. 
Turning now to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight the fourth quarter performance of our Taste division. Our Taste division, with the exception of our Food Services business has remained resilient throughout the pandemic. Taste sales totaling $766 million declined 5% or 1% when excluding the 53rd week comparison. Food Service was down roughly 17% on a similar basis. 
The Taste division achieved approximately 11.8% profit margin, with $90 million in segment profit. These numbers also include approximately $42 million in amortization of intangible assets. If you exclude that amortization, our Q4 margin would be 17.2%. 
Frutarom continued to be pressured in the quarter, declining mid-single digits on a currency-neutral basis as COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Food Service and the end market performance of local and regional customers, both of which represent a large portion of Frutarom's annual sales. 
Looking at our performance by region. Our North American business remains particularly strong, outperforming other markets with mid- single-digit growth. We have experienced challenges for our -- experienced challenges in our Flavors segment in Latin America and Great Asia due to the ongoing pandemic, while our EAME performance was challenged by weakness in Savory Solutions, specifically driven by the Food Services market. 
So returning to profitable growth in our Taste division will remain a top priority in 2021. And we fully expect to deliver improved results and enhanced profitability as we emerge from the pandemic. 
Now turning to Slide 13. I'd like to spend some time on our cash flow. IFF has always been a strong generator of cash, but given our 2020 starting leverage and the fact that N&B was coming along in early 2021 bringing additional debt, it was even more critical that we focused our people on the importance of cash generation across the company. So CapEx and working capital targets were both included in our annual incentives, we launched specific initiatives and we tracked progress throughout the year. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up from $699 million in 2019 to $714 million this year, an increase of 2%. Net income was lower as a function of operating profit but also higher year-over-year transaction and integration-related costs. However, this headwind was more than offset by lower incentive compensation payments in 2020 as a result of our 2019 performance as well as by the timing of payments on some integration-related costs. 
Core working capital was a modest use of cash, driven primarily by timing related to accounts receivable, where Q4 2019 was favorably impacted by the 53rd week. Collections in that extra week ending in January helped 2019's cash flow, and this was always going to be very hard to fully offset this Q4. 
Overall, we are satisfied with the 2020 trajectory of our 5-quarter average cash conversion cycle, which improved 6 days year-over-year. And this was despite holding additional inventory to avoid any customer disruption due to COVID-19-related supply chain issues. 
We also reduced our CapEx to 3.8% of sales versus 4.6% of sales in the prior year period as we prioritized spending more than ever to manage and preserve cash through the pandemic. And travel and on-site work restrictions also helped lower 2020 CapEx. 
All this led to a significant 13% increase in free cash flow compared to 2020's $522 million. And we will be equally focused in 2021 in cash generation and on reducing our overall level of net debt. 
Moving to Slide 14. I would like to address the key assumptions behind our full year 2021 expectations. While we were certainly encouraged by our business trends in the fourth quarter and in January 2021, we expect COVID-19 to have a similar impact in 2021's first half, as we've seen in 2022's second half. While we expect improvements in Fine Fragrance, Food Services and our biorefinery business on a full year basis, 2021 sales will likely remain below our 2019 levels. Assumed in our full year guidance is a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.18, which represents approximately 25% of our combined sales. 
We expect approximately $50 million of merger-related cost synergies with Dupont N&B, mostly back-end loaded this year, with $45 million coming from cost synergies and an additional $5 million from the EBITDA contribution of revenue synergies. 
Now we also provided some additional inputs that should help you model the business moving into 2021. 
We expect total annual depreciation and amortization to be $1.165 billion, which includes amortization of approximately $715 million. 
Annual interest expense is expected to be around $315 million. 
For our annual effective tax rate, we are still working through the details, given that we just completed the acquisition on February 1. While we do have an estimate, it's still being validated by the team, so my preference is to complete additional work before we communicate. 
Lastly, we expect diluted shares outstanding for the pro forma company, for EPS calculation purposes, to be approximately 255 million shares, and that's including the approximately 141 million shares from the transaction. 
For Q1 2021, please do remember that it's 2 months of actuals for N&B and 3 months for IFF when modeling. 
And also, please note that we'll continue to dig into these numbers post close, but we did want to share our thinking at this point in time. So we will update you accordingly should anything change. 
Now turning to Slide 15. I'd like to detail our pro forma full year 2021 financial guidance. In line with the projections included in our December 22 S-4 filing, plus the synergy realization plan communicated January 11, we expect to generate approximately $11.5 billion in sales at an approximately 23.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. Please note that this is a 12-month combined company pro forma estimate and includes approximately $507 million of N&B sales that occurred in January 2021. These metrics reflect our confidence in the combined company's ability to generate strong results in the complex global market as several of our businesses are expected to see improvement throughout the year. On a pro forma basis, sales are expected to grow nearly 4% and EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 100 basis points. 
We should note that we're moving towards reporting and guiding on an adjusted EBITDA basis as part of our broader effort for easier comparability with our peers, which includes our reported sales growth as well. We are redoubling our efforts to be more transparent and investor-focused as a combined company, and we think EBITDA is a key contributor to that in our sector. 
With an even stronger portfolio and enhanced capabilities, the new IFF is starting the year with a strong financial foundation from which to deliver strong results. Our 2021 guidance reflects the strength of our enhanced platform, our expectation that the impact of the pandemic will have meaningfully subsided in the second half and our rigorous focus on execution. As such, we expect to deliver 2021 results that are meaningfully better than 2020's. 
I'd also like to comment on some of the underlying dynamics that we expect will continue into the first quarter of 2021. As we face a strong first quarter comparison from both IFF at 6% and N&B at 3%, we will also continue -- we also continue to manage through pandemic-related headwinds. While the majority of our portfolio delivers essential products and solutions, we expect that Food Service, biorefinery and microbial sales will continue to remain under pressure in the near term or until we lap the COVID-related challenges. 
We are closely monitoring trend improvements in our Fine Fragrances business and are cautious not to extrapolate our Q4 -- our Q4 trends in the first quarter as we believe some of the performance was due to a strong holiday period. 
Building on what Andreas said earlier, I'm pleased to say that we had solid pro forma results in January, with approximately 3% currency-neutral growth on our new disclosure basis. In January 2021, N&B finished with approximately $507 million in sales. Given that N&B became part of IFF's business just -- of IFF just 8 business days ago, we are not providing quarterly guidance. 
Just one reminder for anyone extrapolating out our January results for the quarter. While this has no impact on our full year expected sales, please remember that we moved away from our previous 4 4 5 reporting cycle to calendar month reporting from January. So in Q1 2021, we will have 2 less working days for legacy. Therefore, perhaps a better metric for tracking progress is average daily sales. 
While we do not know where the pandemic will take us, we're happy with our start to 2021. We will continue to thoughtfully manage resources, operating expenses and capital to ensure that our business is well positioned to deliver in an uncertain market. 
We also want to note that since we closed the deal on February 1, we have been working on getting the investment community pro forma segmentation for our combined company. It is our expectation that prior to our first quarter 2021 earnings release in May, we will share our 2020 pro forma sales and EBITDA for each 1 of our 4 segments, [indiscernible], Scent, Health and Biosciences and pharma solutions, including the quarterly and full year details. 
Now moving to Slide 16, and before passing it back to Andreas, let me end by summarizing our go-forward reporting and disclosure updates, all aimed at being more investor-friendly and more comparable to our peers. 
Starting in Q1 2021, we will align our currency-neutral sales reporting to the more common methodology. We will calculate currency-neutral sales growth by taking our revenue in the current period in local currency and applying average FX rates for the prior period to the current period. 
We've shifted from our previous financial reporting calendar of 4, 4, 5 weeks to the more commonly used calendar month end to eliminate comparable issues related to the 53rd week. 
We're also moving towards reporting and guiding on an adjusted EBITDA basis for easier comparability with our peers. This includes both at the consolidated level as well at the segment level. 
And we will be eliminating our corporate expense line in our segment profit table by allocating corporate expenses accordingly to each division. 
Prior to our first quarter 2021 earnings release in May, we will share 2020 pro forma sales and EBITDA for each of our 4 segments, including details by quarter as well as for the full year. 
And now I'd like to turn it back to Andreas."

Turning to Slide 17. Let's focus on 2021 and the new IFF with the N&B business. Our teams executed well on the tremendous integration planning for the transformational combination despite working remotely due to COVID-19. This integration planning effort, more than 1 year long, has provided an opportunity to create the right team and operating model needed to secure our global leadership position. It has been driven by the lessons we have learned in past integrations across both organizations, rounding our plans and practical experience that will enable near-term execution. We set out an aggressive time line in 2019 to close and complete integration planning in 2020. [indiscernible] pandemic only challenged us even further. But I'm very pleased to say that our teams worked extraordinarily well together to complete every aspect of our integration planning. I'm confident that the new IFF is ideally positioned to succeed. With this planning complete, we can entirely focus on execution, delivering our commitments and realizing significant revenue cost synergies, resulting in significant value creation for shareholders for the years to come. 
Let's move to Slide 18 and take a second and we focus on the value proposition of the new IFF. Our new company is poised to realize significant value for all of our stakeholders. And these 2 highly complementary companies form a true innovation partner for all customers. The new IFF will be a force in shaping the future of our industry. Our R&D investment will be 1.5x greater than our nearest peer. We will have #1 or #2 positions in core categories in nutrition, cultures, enzymes, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. This is coupled with the broadest and most diverse customer base in our industry, more than 45,000 in total, and about 48% of our annual sales from small medium and private label customers. We are well positioned to drive profitable growth for our shareholders. 
This allows us to enhance the value we can deliver to our customers in a very powerful way. We can deliver value to customers in every interaction, from leading product offerings to significant benefits of speed to market and supply chain simplification as we deliver market-leading integrated solutions. 
I think it is important to remember that while the N&B transaction is a culminating and transformational move, it is completely consistent how we have been evolving the portfolio over the past 5 years. Our strategy focused on positioning the company for where the industry is going, not where it has been, has required more naturals, more regional supply chains, reaching smaller customers and increasing technology and science-led innovation. Actions like Frutarom, Lucas Meyer, [indiscernible], Flavors and others were important foundational steps as we executed the strategy. 
As we look ahead, we are pleased we have the most complete portfolio in the business. While our portfolio may change around the edges, it is complete and gives us the right base to grow and the right assets to drive the financial results you see from our long-term targets. Put simply, the new IFF will be the strongest partner to customers worldwide to corporate essential solutions for on-trend innovation. 
Now to Slide 19. I would like to emphasize the long-term value creation potential we have seen for IFF. Our new company has substantial synergy opportunities that will drive growth and expand margins. Through our integration planning, we confirmed the run rate revenue synergy expectation at approximately USD 400 million by 2024, with a contribution of at least USD 145 million of EBITDA by that time. 
In addition, we expect to achieve meaningful cost savings, including a run rate cost synergy expectation of USD 300 million by the end of 2023. 
We expect that execution on our plan will unlock about $50 million in EBITDA contribution in 2021. 
I think it's important to say that any combination is not just about synergies, but also to strong and leading-based businesses. Our leaders across legacy IFF and legacy N&B businesses are committed to running every part of this business, both base business and combined, to yield superior results. This requires a mindset of continuous improvement and operational excellence that we are embracing across the organization. 
It is critical to underscore that we have a comprehensive structure in place to track more progress against the identified objectives. At the center of our discussion will be synergy realization, where we will track diligently, including the onetime costs in both expense and capital. 
Our hope is to highlight, on a continuous basis, all value creation levers to provide you with a critical [indiscernible] component of our value creation story. 
And in the end, while we are focused on synergy realization, success will not be defined just as that. It will be the cumulative results where synergies are additive to base business performance for a stronger total P&L. 
On Slide 20, I want to highlight the actions that we are immediately taking to begin execution. One of the most questions we get from investors is not, what will you deliver, but instead, how will you actually do it? As you can imagine, synergy capture is all about the how. And we -- and as we mentioned on January 11, there are 85 separate initiatives behind the $300 million cost savings that are in our plan on the cost side and another several initiatives on the revenue side. We try to give you a flavor for the type of actions that are part of these initiatives. 
In terms of revenue synergies, we have engaged with our top global and regional customers to introduce joint portfolio and capabilities, accelerate co-development partnership with global customers, activate cross-divisional innovation and collaboration in R&D and launch combined commercial excellence and integrated solution teams. 
At a high level, I would characterize the cost actions as follow. First, where there's duplication, we eliminate the duplication. You can imagine across 2 global companies, there's a lot of duplication in back-office and admin functions. 
Second, we look to align our cost structure with best-in-class peers where it is comparable. We have undertaken benchmarking across functions like G&A, which gives us a tangible target for improvement. No 2 organizations are identical. So we use this as a goal rather than a prescription. 
Third, where there is efficiency, we spread the benefits of dollars spend across a larger base. Let me give you an example. Both organizations invest in R&D. We can now leverage across double the categories and customers. This powerful -- and this is powerful and shows you the benefit of global scale for supporting cutting-edge science investments. 
Fourth, I will point out the power of centralized services. We have empowered regional business leaders who drive their P&LS, but they have access to the best-in-class global-shared service centers in areas like HR, finance and procurement where there's a tangible benefit to scale and combine resources. 
And finally, we have set all of our incentive compensation metrics to reflect and align with our base business and integration objectives. 
I really hope this gives you some flavor for the how. We now know the targets we want to deliver and we have told you our long-term goals. So over the coming quarters, focus will be very much on these actions. 
Let's turn to Slide 21. The new IFF is set to deliver a best-in-class financial profile and maximize value for our shareholders. This slide summarizes our long-term outlook, which we introduced to investors at the beginning of this year. 
From a revenue perspective, we expect currency-neutral organic sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% over the next few years, led by our unrivaled product and solutions portfolio, which is set to benefit from our industry-leading R&D programs. 
We also expect to see meaningful operating margin improvements for IFF, including an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% in 2023, up around 400 basis points from our 2020 pro forma. 
The new IFF will continue to generate strong free cash flows, and we expect a significant increase to approximately $2 billion in 2023. 
As we pursue further growth, [ for our ] capital management and delevering, we remain -- will remain a core priority. We are targeting [ almost ] 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 24 to 36 months post close and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Finishing on Slide 22. I would like to thank you all again for joining our call. Across the world, our teams have worked tirelessly throughout a difficult year to ensure IFF continued to serve our customers and deliver strong business results. Our full year financial results showcase the strength of our portfolio and, most importantly, our people. 
Through this challenging environment, we made tremendous progress on our transformational journey. The formation of the new IFF, together with N&B, has made us an even stronger company better positioned to deliver value for our stakeholders. 
With the pre-integration process completed, it's now time to execute. We have the team and structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operating goals in order to shape the future of our industry and improve our world. 
While global volatility is expected to persist, our foundational commitment to our people, customers, communities and planet will remain unchanged as we look to strengthen and redefine our role as the industry-leading ingredients and solutions partner. 
I'm really thrilled for IFF's exciting new chapter, and hope that you will join us on our pursuit to revolutionize the industry and deliver for our customers, teams and shareholders. 
So before opening to questions, please note that our plan for Q&A today is to focus on our results and outlook and not to address questions about market rumors. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I guess, 1 question, 2 parts, on the long-term -- the new long-term target.

I guess, 1 question, 2 parts, on the long-term -- the new long-term target. So on the sales growth piece, what gives confidence you can achieve 4% to 5% organic growth when you haven't achieved that level in recent years? Or I should say, even both businesses haven't achieved that kind of growth in recent years. You're guiding, I think Rustom said 2% to 3% organic, something like that in year 1. So how do you get there? 
And I guess, also, just mechanically, how much contribution from the change in FX accounting would add to that? 
And on the same long-term targets, EBITDA margins, why the same confidence to achieve those margins when EBIT or EBITDA margin has been essentially flat over the last couple of years despite cost synergies, legacy business productivity initiatives? And I get the puts and takes in 2020, but your results have been below peers from an EBITDA growth standpoint, too, in recent years. So maybe if you could just touch on those. I appreciate it's a long question, but it's hopefully important."

Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. Look, we are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term target. Let me explain why. You see that, for example, Scent, a",428,"Yes. Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. 
Look, we are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term target. Let me explain why. You see that, for example, Scent, a very important division of ours, has turned around quite significantly already in a very tough year like 2020. And we see good signs also early this year that this journey will continue. So we are basically here on -- are very much on track. 
The second one is taste. And Taste had a bit of a performance issue in the years '19 and then reaching into '20. But we have seen some sequential improvement and a good start to 2021 as well. We have done all the actions we have to take to bring this division back on track. We have basically split the European region into Western Europe, Africa, Middle East to put more focus on the emerging markets and on the more mature markets. We have put a lot of, let's say, focus on integration efforts of the Frutarom organization, particularly in Europe last year. So fully integrated. And we have restructured our go-to-market strategy. And it looks like that we are starting to perform well. So I think that's very confident on the legacy IFF side. 
On N&B, I think it depends. You have seen a lot of pieces of the portfolio which has a good growth profile. We will continue. And we should not underestimate that parts of the portfolio was also, particularly last year, pressured by COVID. And that will help, at least in the second half of this year, to come out of that. 
And secondly, we -- certainly, we have seen actually good customer response as well on their portfolio and in terms of recent wins. 
On top of it, we have the cross-selling and integrated solutions which will help us to increase our growth rate as well. So we are very confident that we can do it. 
On the EBITDA margin, we took -- on legacy IFF, we took actions. We started, as I said, with the Scent division, not just on sales. But on EBITDA as well, we see good improvement. The same will happen on the Taste side. And actually, I'm less worried about the N&B side because they have done actually good EBITDA, let's say, increase of margins in the last couple of years. 
With that, I hand it over to Rustom to comment on FX, please."

I mean, if you think about weighted average basket of our currencies and we look at the biggest currencies for us, the U.S. dollar is the biggest, but the euro/Danish krona, because that's pretty much tied to the euro, that's the second biggest. It's actually, when you put in the Danish krona, it's about 27%. Okay, those are the 2 big ones. And then the others, I mean, the real, the Japanese yes, the Indian rupee or many others, right? 
If we look at a weighted basket of those, and if you looked at the what was in our basic budget this year versus 2020 -- '21 versus '20, was about a 1% difference. That's what we had. And if you look at spot today, it's actually running better than that from our perspective, from a revenue -- from revenue. 
So our expected '21 growth rate remains about 3.5%. That's what we put out there, right, with a small contribution from synergies. And no change to the S-4 or the Jan 11 update. And as you've seen from our January '21 preliminary sales growth of around 3%, we've started roughly in line with our expectations."

What was impacting Taste in general was probably also the customer structure because we had probably more smaller customers and midsized customers compared to some of the competitors.

First of all, when we started actually laying out -- or looking at our strategy in 2015, I think what went well, we had a very clear strategy because the environment is changing or was changing. So we have different customer demands, maybe more integrated solutions, more demand for naturals. We have seen that the smaller customers have taken a better -- bigger share and that adjacencies play a role not just for integrated solutions, but in general, to move the business forward. So I believe our strategy was very clear and that worked out very, very well. And that has led actually, when we look at the company back in '14, it was slightly below $3 billion in sales with a limited offering at that point in time. I know we're an $11 billion company with a very broad offering and, in many instances, we are #1 and #2 in the defined categories. I think so strategy and our response to the changing market was very, very good. We have basically positioned ourselves really to deliver very significant growth over the years to come. 
If you look at things which might have gone better, we can touch on Frutarom. I think what went well is it was strategically the right move. We have good synergies on the cost side. I would say top line was challenged for many reasons. I think we learned our lesson on compliance, certainly. And we probably could have integrated faster the European organization, which is done right now. I think that was important. 
And then in between, we certainly had the crisis [ and sensor ] supply and we have had to turn around the business here. And I think that worked out very well. 
So in balance, I think the right strategy, the right moves, on the food side, I think some areas on the top line, where some of it is compliance, let's say, related, but we fixed it. I think -- and we fixed it fast, maybe faster than others would have done it. And we finally have integrated the commercial structure here as well. 
So that's how I would look at the next -- at the last 5 years. And I think we are tremendously good positioned for the next couple of years right now. And I can promise you, there's certainly no big acquisitions coming in the next couple of years. It's all focused about execution and shareholder value. That's very clear because we have everything we need."

Does that target need to change with the new methodology for revenue disclosure? Because inherently, you're including some FX-driven pricing in that. So I just wanted to make sure I understand that. 
And the second was just a longer-term question on that revenue target. And while I certainly appreciate taking a more conservative view and leaving room for delivery on synergies and so on to provide upside, I just wonder what that implies about your view on market growth. Because with this transaction and with the objective of creating a different business model for the industry, your long-term revenue targets are sort of what they were before. And I'm just wondering how that relates to your view on market growth, because it just seems like a lot of work to sort of grow at the same pace you were targeting before."

So, listen, the revenue target, and we were discussing that internally a lot. The issue right now for us is in this COVID period, we have certainly for '21, let's say, plan for a slower start because, as Rustom said, for the first half of the year, it's still the COVID time, there's a lockdown in Europe. So we take it a bit more careful here before we go full force. We believe that the market growth will be impacted this year, in particular, the first 6 months. So that makes certainly, let's say, for a slower start. 
But looking further, we are actually pretty bullish because if you take the average 4% to 5% for the following years, we are at 5%. And that actually is, for the 2 combined companies, quite a nice and good target to go. And it's certainly above the average both organizations have done in the last 2 or 3 years. So I feel good about it. 
And certainly, it is the focus of the execution. Our very, let's say, very good exposure to some of the growth markets. And then certainly, the cross-selling opportunities we are having and the integrated solution, as you were mentioning, we are changing a bit the business model here. So that's how we see it. But more to come. Look, at the end of the day, in these volatile times, we have to move forward and to adapt as fast as we can.

Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars using FX assumptions back at the time [indiscernible] right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change. So if the exact same situation applied over the last couple of years,",291,"Yes. Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars using FX assumptions back at the time [indiscernible] right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change. So if the exact same situation applied over the last couple of years, our revenue dollars wouldn't have been any different, but the currency-neutral growth would have been higher, right? 
Having said that, and this is kind of interesting, if you took this morning's spot rates and assume that they extrapolate out for the entire year, I mean they are a couple of percent higher than that weighted average that we talked about earlier to answer the earlier question, right, that may be up 1% on the prior year. So you have another couple of percent. And that would translate out into reported growth. For sure, the actual reported dollar numbers would be higher. But I mean, you wouldn't see the currency-neutral percentages coming off. So it's a complex kind of way of looking at it. 
But the bigger point, if you're looking about the way we came up with the actual numbers back then, and this is the -- I just want to reinforce that, we had, in the out years, our business growth from the base business without synergies or anything like that, growing at 3.5% to 4%. And that we think is realistic based on our Scent and Taste business, right, if I go back to that. And the N&B business was in that ballpark as well, okay. We think that's realistic going through those numbers. 
You put in the synergies, which are like $140 million in 2022 revenue and $300 million in 2023, our expectation, and that's how you get up to the 5% [indiscernible] numbers out there."

We will begin by sharing a detailed look into our fourth quarter and the full year 2020 results, and then Rustom and I will highlight the go-forward outlook and opportunity for the new IFF. 
I'm really excited and proud to say that as of February 1, we have officially completed our merger with DuPont N&B. Our teams have hit the ground running establishing our new company as an innovation leader in the global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. 
With the close of the N&B transaction, we also unveiled a new brand identity and purpose intended to unify our organization and best position our divisions for success. As a purpose-driven enterprise, we share a mission to build from strength and transform our industry. We are now squarely focused on execution, building on recent performance to leverage the exciting capabilities and broader customer base of our new company. I'm confident that the direction that we are moving and the opportunity ahead of us will lead to accelerated growth and improve profitability as we generate strong value creation and total shareholder return. 
Beginning with Slide 6, I would like to recap what was truly a remarkable 2020. Amid an unprecedented pandemic that challenged our global organization, we delivered solid financial results while embarking on a transformational journey to create a new industry leader together with DuPont N&B. I'm pleased to report that we completed 2020 with positive momentum on a comparable basis, and we have seen this trend continue in January 2021 as a combined company. 
In 2020, our portfolio remained resilient to an evolving and incredible challenging global environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. IFF generated USD 5.1 billion in sales for the full year 2020, about a 1% increase on a currency-neutral basis from last year when excluding the 53rd week of 2019. This sales growth was primarily driven by strong performance in our Scent division, which we believe is even better positioned to capture further market share in 2021. 
We achieved an adjusted operating margin, excluding amortization, of 18.1%, driven by our synergy efforts with Frutarom and pursuing additional productivity initiatives across the business. 
As we reflect on the integration of Frutarom, we are pleased with what we have achieved as it relates to cost synergies from procurement, manufacturing and administrative expenses. Acknowledging the revenue challenges at Frutarom over the past 2 years, we have restructured the business and, going forward, it will be an integral part of our larger new segment, including Taste, Food and Beverage segments now we have the combined combination with N&B. 
We really emphasized free cash flow management throughout the year. This led to meaningful increases year-over-year as we continued to focus on managing our balance sheet through the pandemic. We finished the year with an adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $5.70. 
With the completion of our combination with DuPont N&B, we have also achieved the important milestone of completing the integration planning phase related to the merger. We are now focused on execution going forward as we are committed to realizing the meaningful synergies presented by the transaction. For capital synergy opportunity, we are encouraging collaboration across divisions and closely aligning with the markets and regions we serve to showcase the full breadth of IFF's new portfolio. I will provide further details regarding our integration initiatives a bit later. 
On Slide 7, let's take a second look at the sales dynamic that we have seen across the business. Reflecting on 2020, we were off to a very strong start, growing 6% in Q1 2020, until the pandemic had a profound impact on society and, ultimately, our business. 
Given the disruption of the year, we want to offer a bit more perspective on the trends we have seen within our business as we cover from the peak of the regulatory restrictions of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our growth rates continued to improve in the fourth quarter, up 2% excluding the 53rd week, versus the 1% year-on-year growth seen in the third quarter. A large part of this improvement came from Fine Fragrance, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter. 
As we have noted before, roughly 15% of our business was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and decreased by 16% in 2020, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. 
The vast majority of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection type products, is defensive in nature or benefited from the pandemic. This was roughly 85% of our pre-pandemic sales and these grew approximately 4% for the full year, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. 
Our performance was strong with multinational customers, especially those who benefited from the pandemic. However, our exposure to local and regional players adversely impacted sales. I think it's important to remember that while these smaller and regional customers were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, they have historically been an important source of growth across our industry and we expect them to be important contributors in our recovery. 
On the whole, we are proud of the results achieved and resilience of our business in 2020. Some of our end markets have seen prolonged and significant negative impact that led to inevitable headwinds for certain segments. However, when you look at the whole of our portfolio, we see strong results with meaningful momentum that affirm our central role in the consumer product good value chain. That gives me great confidence as we begin to execute as a new IFF with the N&B business in 2021. 
As we begin 2021, I'm very pleased to say we, on a combined company basis, had a strong performance in January, with approximately 3% currency-neutral growth against a strong year-ago comparison. Scent trends continued to be very strong, Taste improved and N&B continued to be pressured by COVID. It is good to see that the business has had steady improvement since the pandemic lows. 
I would now like to pass the call over to Rustom, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance in the fourth quarter."

I will cover the P&L high points on this slide and get into additional detail as we go through the following several slides. 
In the fourth quarter, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, down 2% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. When excluding the roughly $50 million impact of 2019's 53rd week, our comparable currency-neutral growth was plus 2%, and as I'll explain on the next slide, up approximately 4%, counting foreign exchange-related price changes as our peers in many CPGs disclosed. While Taste performed at levels similar to Q3 2020, we did see a significant acceleration in Scent. 
In the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, decreased by 10% on a currency-neutral basis, or by 9% including a 1 percentage point benefit of FX, with solid operating performance -- operational performance offset by a challenging year-ago comparable and COVID costs. 
We delivered adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.32, mostly as a result of lower operating profit in the quarter. This was down 11% on a currency-neutral basis, or 10% including the 1 percentage point benefit of FX. 
It was good to finally see foreign currency having a positive impact on sales, operating profit and EPS in the quarter. 
Now moving to Slide 9. I would like to focus on the emerging markets and currency impacts on our results, both in the fourth quarter and the full year, to provide better clarity regarding our currency-neutral sales growth. 
For the fourth quarter and for the full year, the impact of FX-related pricing was approximately 2 percentage points. To be clear, if we simply looked at our revenue in the current period by local currency and applied the average FX rates from the prior period to the current period, our currency-neutral growth of 2% in the fourth quarter would have been up approximately 4%, and our full year currency-neutral growth of 1% would go to approximately 3%, all excluding the impact of the 53rd week. At the segment level, Scent would have grown 10% in Q4 2020 and 7% in the full financial year, while Taste would have been up 1% in both Q4 and the full year 2020. Again, all excluding the impact of the 53rd week. 
Responding to feedback from our investors and after further review of what our competitors and other CPG companies are doing, starting in Q1 2021, we will align our reporting with our peers' methodology. For 2021, our plan is to provide this on a consolidated basis and divisional level. And before our next earnings call, we'll provide a historical restatement of growth by division for 2020. 
Moving now to Slide 10. Let me break down the key factors impacting our Q4 profitability. I do want to go into more detail on this as the overall results hide some meaningful operational improvements that support our optimism and momentum heading into 2021. 
A close look at our operating profit bridge shows that we were able to drive operational improvements, about 8%, largely attained through Frutarom synergy realization, productivity initiatives and reformulation activities, mostly in Scent; higher volumes ex the 53rd week and disciplined cost management. As expected and communicated earlier this year, there was a negative impact from our annual incentive compensation, or our AIP program reset, which was a direct result of weak Q4 2019 results. Further negative offsets came from a challenging year-to-year comparable, which included the 53rd week and the Brazilian indirect tax RSA benefit that both occurred in 2019, and in 2020, incremental COVID-19 costs, which we expect will only reduce in the second half of 2021. Unfortunately, these combined items represent an 18 percentage point year-over-year headwind and were the primary driver of our 10% currency-neutral decline in operating profit. 
Now on Slide 11, I'd like to discuss our Scent division results in more detail. Another strong overall performance from Scent. Sales totaling $504 million were up 3%, or 7% when excluding the 53rd week comparison. We've continued to see strong growth from our Consumer Fragrance business with a high single digit increase, driven by strong performances in our Home Care and Personal Wash categories. Also, the new [ color is], where we recently gained access in Consumer Fragrance, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 60% in the fourth quarter and represented more than 1/3 of our Consumer Fragrance growth. 
I'm also happy to share that we returned to growth in our Fine Fragrance business with a mid-single-digit increase as a result of several new wins in North America and Europe. While this was a nice development in Q4 2020, we're cautious and are not extrapolating the trend for the first quarter of 2021. 
In Fragrance Ingredients, we experienced a high single-digit growth, driven by double-digit growth in Cosmetic Actives. 
So overall, the Scent division achieved a 15.9% profit margin on the $504 million of sales in the quarter. 
Our recent performance across the Scent portfolio is encouraging and will remain a core piece of our growth story moving forward, bolstered over time by expanded sales opportunities from working together with N&B. The team has done a tremendous job delivering market-leading growth, adjusted for the reporting differences over the past 3 years, while improving Scent's margin profile. 
Turning now to Slide 12. I'd like to highlight the fourth quarter performance of our Taste division. Our Taste division, with the exception of our Food Services business, has remained resilient throughout the pandemic. Taste sales totaling $766 million declined 5%, or 1% when excluding the 53rd week comparison. Food Service was down roughly 17% on a similar basis. 
The Taste division achieved approximately 11.8% profit margin, with $90 million in segment profit. These numbers also include approximately $42 million in amortization of intangible assets. If you exclude that amortization, our Q4 margin would be 17.2%. 
Frutarom continued to be pressured in the quarter, declining mid-single digits on a currency-neutral basis as COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Food Service and the end market performance of local and regional customers, both of which represent a large portion of Frutarom's annual sales. 
Looking at our performance by region. Our North American business remains particularly strong, outperforming other markets with mid- single-digit growth. We have experienced challenges -- experienced challenges in our Flavors segment in Latin America and Greater Asia due to the ongoing pandemic, while our EAME performance was challenged by weakness in Savory Solutions, specifically driven by the Food Services market. 
So returning to profitable growth in our Taste division will remain a top priority in 2021. And we fully expect to deliver improved results and enhanced profitability as we emerge from the pandemic. 
Now turning to Slide 13. I'd like to spend some time on our cash flow. IFF has always been a strong generator of cash, but given our 2020 starting leverage and the fact that N&B was coming along in early 2021 bringing additional debt, it was even more critical that we focus our people on the importance of cash generation across the company. So CapEx and working capital targets were both included in our annual incentives, we launched specific initiatives and we tracked progress throughout the year. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up from $699 million in 2019 to $714 million this year, an increase of 2%. Net income was lower as a function of operating profit but also higher year-over-year transaction and integration-related costs. However, this headwind was more than offset by lower incentive compensation payments in 2020 as a result of our 2019 performance as well as by the timing of payments on some integration-related costs. 
Core working capital was a modest use of cash, driven primarily by timing related to accounts receivable, where Q4 2019 was favorably impacted by the 53rd week. Collections in that extra week ending in January helped 2019's cash flow, and this was always going to be very hard to fully offset this Q4. 
Overall, we're satisfied with the 2020 trajectory of our 5-quarter average cash conversion cycle, which improved 6 days year-over-year. And this was despite holding additional inventory to avoid any customer disruption due to COVID-19-related supply chain issues. 
We also reduced our CapEx to 3.8% of sales versus 4.6% of sales in the prior year period as we prioritized spending more than ever to manage and preserve cash through the pandemic. And travel and on-site work restrictions also helped lower 2020 CapEx. 
All this led to a significant 13% increase in free cash flow compared to 2020's $522 million. And we will be equally focused in 2021 in cash generation and on reducing our overall level of net debt. 
Moving to Slide 14. I would like to address the key assumptions behind our full year 2021 expectations. While we were certainly encouraged by our business trends in the fourth quarter and in January 2021, we expect COVID-19 to have a similar impact in 2021's first half, as we've seen in 2022's (sic) [ 2020's ] second half. While we expect improvements in Fine Fragrance, Food Services and our biorefinery business on a full year basis, 2021 sales will likely remain below our 2019 levels. Assumed in our full year guidance is a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.18, which represents approximately 25% of our combined sales. 
We expect approximately $50 million of merger-related cost synergies with DuPont N&B, mostly back-end loaded this year, with $45 million coming from cost synergies and an additional $5 million from the EBITDA contribution of revenue synergies. 
Now we also provided some additional inputs that should help you model the business moving into 2021. 
We expect total annual depreciation and amortization to be $1.165 billion, which includes amortization of approximately $715 million. Annual interest expense is expected to be around $315 million. 
For our annual effective tax rate, we are still working through the details, given that we just completed the acquisition on February 1. While we do have an estimate, it's still being validated by the team, so my preference is to complete additional work before we communicate. 
Lastly, we expect diluted shares outstanding for the pro forma company, for EPS calculation purposes, to be approximately 255 million shares, and that's including the approximately 141 million shares from the transaction. 
For Q1 2021, please do remember that it's 2 months of actuals for N&B and 3 months for IFF when modeling. And also, please note that we'll continue to dig into these numbers post close, but we did want to share our thinking at this point in time. So we will update you accordingly should anything change. 
Now turning to Slide 15. I'd like to detail our pro forma full year 2021 financial guidance. In line with the projections included in our December 22 S-4 filing, plus the synergy realization plan communicated January 11, we expect to generate approximately $11.5 billion in sales at an approximately 23.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. Please note that this is a 12-month combined company pro forma estimate and includes approximately $507 million of N&B sales that occurred in January 2021. These metrics reflect our confidence in the combined company's ability to generate strong results in the complex global market as several of our businesses are expected to see improvement throughout the year. On a pro forma basis, sales are expected to grow nearly 4% and EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 100 basis points. 
We should note that we are moving towards reporting and guiding on an adjusted EBITDA basis as part of our broader effort for easier comparability with our peers, which includes our reported sales growth as well. We are redoubling our efforts to be more transparent and investor-focused as a combined company, and we think EBITDA is a key contributor to that in our sector. 
With an even stronger portfolio and enhanced capabilities, the new IFF is starting the year with a strong financial foundation from which to deliver strong results. Our 2021 guidance reflects the strength of our enhanced platform, our expectation that the impact of the pandemic will have meaningfully subsided in the second half and our rigorous focus on execution. As such, we expect to deliver 2021 results that are meaningfully better than 2020's. 
I'd also like to comment on some of the underlying dynamics that we expect will continue into the first quarter of 2021. As we face a strong first quarter comparison from both IFF at 6% and N&B at 3%, we will also continue -- we also continue to manage through pandemic-related headwinds. While the majority of our portfolio delivers essential products and solutions, we expect that Food Service, biorefinery and microbial sales will continue to remain under pressure in the near term or until we lap the COVID-related challenges. 
We are closely monitoring trend improvements in our Fine Fragrances business and are cautious not to extrapolate our Q4 -- our Q4 trends in the first quarter as we believe some of the performance was due to a strong holiday period. 
Building on what Andreas said earlier, I'm pleased to say that we had solid pro forma results in January, with approximately 3% currency-neutral growth on our new disclosure basis. In January 2021, N&B finished with approximately $507 million in sales. Given that N&B became part of IFF's business just -- of IFF just 8 business days ago, we are not providing quarterly guidance. 
Just one reminder for anyone extrapolating out our January results for the quarter. While this has no impact on our full year expected sales, please remember that we moved away from our previous 4, 4, 5 reporting cycle to calendar month reporting from January. So in Q1 2021, we will have 2 less working days for legacy IFF. Therefore, perhaps a better metric for tracking progress is average daily sales. 
While we do not know where the pandemic will take us, we're happy with our start to 2021. We will continue to thoughtfully manage resources, operating expenses and capital to ensure that our business is well positioned to deliver in an uncertain market. 
We also want to note that since we closed the deal on February 1, we have been working on getting the investment community pro forma segmentation for our combined company. It is our expectation that prior to our first quarter 2021 earnings release in May, we will share our 2020 pro forma sales and EBITDA for each 1 of our 4 segments, Nourish, Scent, Health and Biosciences and Pharma Solutions, including the quarterly and full year details. 
Now moving to Slide 16, and before passing it back to Andreas, let me end by summarizing our go-forward reporting and disclosure updates, all aimed at being more investor-friendly and more comparable to our peers. 
Starting in Q1 2021, we will align our currency-neutral sales reporting to the more common methodology. We will calculate currency-neutral sales growth by taking our revenue in the current period in local currency and applying average FX rates for the prior period to the current period. 
We've shifted from our previous financial reporting calendar of 4, 4, 5 weeks to the more commonly used calendar month end to eliminate comparable issues related to the 53rd week. 
We're also moving towards reporting and guiding on an adjusted EBITDA basis for easier comparability with our peers. This includes both at the consolidated level as well at the segment level. And we will be eliminating our corporate expense line in our segment profit table by allocating corporate expenses accordingly to each division. 
Prior to our first quarter 2021 earnings release in May, we will share 2020 pro forma sales and EBITDA for each of our 4 segments, including details by quarter as well as for the full year. 
And now I'd like to turn it back to Andreas."

Turning to Slide 17. Let's focus on 2021 and the new IFF with the N&B business. Our teams executed well on the tremendous integration planning for the transformational combination despite working remotely due to COVID-19. This integration planning effort, more than 1 year long, has provided an opportunity to create the right team and operating model needed to secure our global leadership position. It has been driven by the lessons we have learned in past integrations across both organizations, rounding our plans and practical experience that will enable near-term execution. We set out an aggressive time line in 2019 to close and complete integration planning in 2020. 
The global pandemic only challenged us even further. But I'm very pleased to say that our teams worked extraordinarily well together to complete every aspect of our integration planning. I'm confident that the new IFF is ideally positioned to succeed. With this planning complete, we can entirely focus on execution, delivering our commitments and realizing significant revenue cost synergies, resulting in significant value creation for shareholders for the years to come. 
Let's move to Slide 18 and take a second and we focus on the value proposition of the new IFF. Our new company is poised to realize significant value for all of our stakeholders. And these 2 highly complementary companies form a true innovation partner for all customers. The new IFF will be a force in shaping the future of our industry. Our R&D investment will be 1.5x greater than our nearest peer. We will have #1 or #2 positions in core categories in nutrition, cultures, enzymes, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. This is coupled with the broadest and most diverse customer base in our industry, more than 45,000 in total, and about 48% of our annual sales from small medium and private label customers. We are well positioned to drive profitable growth for our shareholders. 
This allows us to enhance the value we can deliver to our customers in a very powerful way. We can deliver value to customers in every interaction, from leading product offerings to significant benefits of speed to market and supply chain simplification as we deliver market-leading integrated solutions. 
I think it is important to remember that while the N&B transaction is a culminating and transformational move, it is completely consistent how we have been evolving the portfolio over the past 5 years. Our strategy focused on positioning the company for where the industry is going, not where it has been. That has required more naturals, more regional supply chains, reaching smaller customers and increasing technology and science-led innovation. Actions like Frutarom, Lucas Meyer, Ottens Flavors and others were important foundational steps as we executed the strategy. 
As we look ahead, we are pleased we have the most complete portfolio in the business. While our portfolio may change around the edges, it is complete and gives us the right base to grow and the right assets to drive the financial results you see from our long-term targets. Put simply, the new IFF will be the strongest partner to customers worldwide to corporate essential solutions for on-trend innovation. 
Now to Slide 19. I would like to emphasize the long-term value creation potential we have seen for IFF. Our new company has substantial synergy opportunities that will drive growth and expand margins. Through our integration planning, we confirmed the run rate revenue synergy expectation at approximately USD 400 million by 2024, with a contribution of at least USD 145 million of EBITDA by that time. 
In addition, we expect to achieve meaningful cost savings, including a run rate cost synergy expectation of USD 300 million by the end of 2023. 
We expect that execution on our plan will unlock about $50 million in EBITDA contribution in 2021. 
I think it's important to say that any combination is not just about synergies, but also to strong and leading-based businesses. Our leaders across legacy IFF and legacy N&B businesses are committed to running every part of this business, both base business and combined, to yield superior results. This requires a mindset of continuous improvement and operational excellence that we are embracing across the organization. 
It is critical to underscore that we have a comprehensive structure in place to track more progress against the identified objectives. At the center of our discussion will be synergy realization, where we will track diligently, including the onetime costs in both expense and capital. 
Our hope is to highlight, on a continuous basis, all value creation levers to provide you with a critical how component of our value creation story. 
And in the end, while we are focused on synergy realization, success will not be defined just as that. It will be the cumulative results where synergies are additive to base business performance for a stronger total P&L. 
On Slide 20, I want to highlight the actions that we are immediately taking to begin execution. One of the most questions we get from investors is, not what will you deliver, but instead, how will you actually do it? As you can imagine, synergy capture is all about the how. And we -- and as we mentioned on January 11th, there are 85 separate initiatives behind the $300 million cost savings that are in our plan on the cost side and another several initiatives on the revenue side. We try to give you a flavor for the type of actions that are part of these initiatives. 
In terms of revenue synergies, we have engaged with our top global and regional customers to introduce joint portfolio and capabilities, accelerate co-development partnership with global customers, activate cross-divisional innovation and collaboration in R&D and launch combined commercial excellence and integrated solution teams. 
At a high level, I would characterize the cost actions as follow. First, where there's duplication, we eliminate the duplication. You can imagine across 2 global companies, there's a lot of duplication in back-office and admin functions. 
Second, we look to align our cost structure with best-in-class peers where it is comparable. We have undertaken benchmarking across functions like G&A, which gives us a tangible target for improvement. No 2 organizations are identical. So we use this as a goal rather than a prescription. 
Third, where there is efficiency, we spread the benefits of dollar spend across a larger base. Let me give you an example. Both organizations invest in R&D. We can now leverage across double the categories and customers. This powerful -- and this is powerful and shows you the benefit of global scale for supporting cutting-edge science investments. 
Fourth, I will point out the power of centralized services. We have empowered regional business leaders who drive their P&LS, but they have access to the best-in-class global-shared service centers in areas like HR, finance and procurement where there's a tangible benefit to scale and combine resources. 
And finally, we have set all of our incentive compensation metrics to reflect and align with our base business and integration objectives. 
I really hope this gives you some flavor for the how. We now know the targets we want to deliver and we have told you our long-term goals. So over the coming quarters, focus will be very much on these actions. 
Let's turn to Slide 21. The new IFF is set to deliver a best-in-class financial profile and maximize value for our shareholders. This slide summarizes our long-term outlook, which we introduced to investors at the beginning of this year. 
From a revenue perspective, we expect currency-neutral organic sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% over the next few years, led by our unrivaled product and solutions portfolio, which is set to benefit from our industry-leading R&D programs. 
We also expect to see meaningful operating margin improvements for IFF, including an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% in 2023, up around 400 basis points from our 2020 pro forma. 
The new IFF will continue to generate strong free cash flows, and we expect a significant increase to approximately $2 billion in 2023. 
As we pursue further growth towards capital management and delevering, we remain -- we will remain at core priority. We are targeting almost 3x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, 24 to 36 months post close and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Finishing on Slide 22. I would like to thank you all again for joining our call. Across the world, our teams have worked tirelessly throughout a difficult year to ensure IFF continued to serve our customers and deliver strong business results. Our full year financial results showcase the strength of our portfolio and, most importantly, our people. 
Through this challenging environment, we made tremendous progress on our transformational journey. The formation of the new IFF, together with N&B, has made us an even stronger company, better positioned to deliver value for our stakeholders. 
With the pre-integration process completed, it's now time to execute. We have the team and structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operating goals in order to shape the future of our industry and improve our world. 
While global volatility is expected to persist, our foundational commitment to our people, customers, communities and planet will remain unchanged as we look to strengthen and redefine our role as the industry-leading ingredients and solutions partner. 
I'm really thrilled for IFF's exciting new chapter, and hope that you will join us on our pursuit to revolutionize the industry and deliver for our customers, teams and shareholders. 
So before opening to questions, please note that our plan for Q&A today is to focus on our results and outlook and not to address questions about market rumors. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So on the sales growth piece, what gives confidence you can achieve 4% to 5% organic growth when you haven't achieved that level in recent years? Or I should say, even both businesses haven't achieved that kind of growth in recent years. You're guiding, I think Rustom said 2% to 3% organic, something like that in year 1. So how do you get there? 
And I guess, also, just mechanically, how much contribution from the change in FX accounting would add to that? 
And on the same long-term targets, EBITDA margins, why the same confidence to achieve those margins when EBIT or EBITDA margin has been essentially flat over the last couple of years despite cost synergies, legacy business productivity initiatives? And I get the puts and takes in 2020, but your results have been below peers from an EBITDA growth standpoint, too, in recent years. So maybe if you could just touch on those. I appreciate it's a long question, but it's hopefully important."

Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. Look, we are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term target. Let me explain why. You see that, for example, Scent, a",430,"Yes. Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. 
Look, we are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term target. Let me explain why. You see that, for example, Scent, a very important division of ours, has turned around quite significantly already in a very tough year like 2020. And we see good signs also early this year that this journey will continue. So we are basically here on -- are very much on track. 
The second one is Taste. And Taste is -- had a bit of a performance issue in the years '19 and then reaching into '20. But we have seen some sequential improvement and a good start to 2021 as well. We have done all the actions we have to take to bring this division back on track. We have basically split the European region into Western Europe, Africa, Middle East to put more focus on the emerging markets and on the more mature markets. We have put a lot of, let's say, focus on integration efforts of the Frutarom organization, particularly in Europe last year. So fully integrated. And we have restructured our go-to-market strategy. And it looks like that we are starting to perform well. So I think that's very confident on the legacy IFF side. 
On N&B, I think it depends. You have seen a lot of pieces of the portfolio, which has a good growth profile. We will continue. And we should not underestimate that parts of the portfolio was also, particularly last year, pressured by COVID. And that will help, at least in the second half of this year, to come out of that. 
And secondly, we -- certainly, we have seen actually good customer response as well on their portfolio and in terms of recent wins. 
On top of it, we have the cross-selling and integrated solutions, which will help us to increase our growth rate as well. So we are very confident that we can do it. 
On the EBITDA margin, we took on legacy IFF -- we took actions. We started, as I said, with the Scent division, not just on sales, but on EBITDA as well. We see good improvement. The same will happen on the Taste side. And actually, I'm less worried about the N&B side because they have done actually good EBITDA, let's say, increase of margins in the last couple of years. 
With that, I hand it over to Rustom to comment on FX, please."

It's actually, when you put in the Danish krona, it's about 27%. Okay, those are the 2 big ones. And then the others, I mean, the real, the Japanese yen, the Indian rupee or many others, right? 
If we look at a weighted basket of those, and if you looked at the -- what was in our basic budget this year versus 2020 -- '21 versus '20, was about a 1% difference. That's what we had. And if you look at spot today, it's actually running better than that from our perspective, from a revenue -- from revenue. 
So our expected '21 growth rate remains about 3.5%. That's what we put out there, right, with a small contribution from synergies. And no change to the S-4 or the Jan 11 update.

First of all, when we started, actually, laying out -- or looking at our strategy in 2015, I think what went well, we had a very clear strategy. Because the environment is changing or was changing. So we have different customer demands, maybe more integrated solutions, more demand for naturals. We have seen that the smaller customers have taken a better -- bigger share, and that adjacencies play a role not just for integrated solutions, but in general, to move the business forward. 
So I believe our strategy was very clear and that worked out very, very well. And that has led actually, when we look at the company back in '14, it was slightly below $3 billion in sales, with a limited offering at that point in time. I know we're an $11 billion company with a very broad offering and, in many instances, we are #1 and #2 in the defined categories. I think so strategy and our response to the changing market was very, very good. We have basically positioned ourselves really to deliver very significant growth over the years to come. 
If you look at things which might have gone better, we can touch on Frutarom. I think what went well is it was strategically the right move. We have good synergies on the cost side. I would say top line was challenged for many reasons. I think we learned our lesson on compliance, certainly. And we probably could have integrated faster the European organization, which is done right now. I think that was important. 
And then in between, we certainly had the crisis and sensor supply and we have had to turn around the business here. And I think that worked out very well. 
So in balance, I think the right strategy, the right moves, on the food side, I think some areas on the top line, where some of it is compliance, let's say, related, but we fixed it. I think -- and we fixed it fast, maybe faster than others would have done it. And we finally have integrated the commercial structure here as well. 
So that's how I would look at the next -- at the last 5 years. And I think we are tremendously good positioned for the next couple of years right now. And I can promise you, there's certainly no big acquisitions coming in the next couple of years. It's all focused about execution and shareholder value. That's very clear because we have everything we need."

Does that target need to change with the new methodology for revenue disclosure? Because inherently, you're including some FX-driven pricing in that. So I just wanted to make sure I understand that. 
And the second was just a longer-term question on that revenue target. And while I certainly appreciate taking a more conservative view and leaving room for delivery on synergies and so on to provide upside, I just wonder what that implies about your view on market growth. Because with this transaction and with the objective of creating a different business model for the industry, your long-term revenue targets are sort of what they were before. And I'm just wondering how that relates to your view on market growth. Because it just seems like a lot of work to sort of grow at the same pace you were targeting before."

So, listen, the revenue target, and we were discussing that internally a lot. The issue right now for us is in this COVID period, we have certainly, for '21, let's say, planned for a slower start because, as Rustom said, for the first half of the year, it's still the COVID time, there's a lockdown in Europe. So we take it a bit more carefully here before we go full force. We believe that the market growth will be impacted this year, in particular, the first 6 months. So that makes, certainly, let's say, for a slower start. 
But looking further, we are actually pretty bullish because if you take the average 4% to 5% for the following years, we are at 5%. And that actually is, for the 2 combined companies, quite a nice and good target to go. And it's certainly above the average, both organizations have done in the last 2 or 3 years. So I feel good about it. 
And certainly, it is the focus of the execution. Our very, let's say, very good exposure to some of the growth markets. And then certainly, the cross-selling opportunities we are having and the integrated solution, as you were mentioning, we are changing a bit the business model here. So that's how we see it.

Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars using FX assumptions back at the time of the situation, right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change.

Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars using FX assumptions back at the time of the situation, right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change. So if the exact same situation applied over the last couple of years, our revenue dollars wouldn't have been any different, but the currency-neutral growth would have been higher, right? 
Having said that, and this is kind of interesting, if you took this morning's spot rates and assume that they extrapolate it out for the entire year, I mean they are a couple of percent higher than that weighted average that we talked about earlier, to answer the earlier question, right, and may be up 1% on the prior year. So you have another couple of percent. And that would translate out into reported growth, for sure. The actual reported dollar numbers would be higher. But I mean, you wouldn't see the currency-neutral percentages coming off. So it's a complex kind of way of looking at it. 
But the bigger point, if you're looking about the way we came up with the actual numbers back then, and this is the -- I just want to reinforce that, we had, in the out years, our business growth from the base business without synergies or anything like that, growing at 3.5% to 4%. And that we think is realistic based on our Scent and Taste business, right, if I go back to that. And the N&B business was in that ballpark as well, okay. We think that's realistic going through those numbers. 
You put in the synergies, which are like $140 million in 2022 revenue and $300 million in 2023, our expectation, and that's how you get up to the 5% numbers out there."

A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com.
Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.
I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we are making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook based on the current state and our expectations for 2021. These statements contain elements of uncertainty, which we have laid out on Slide 2 under the cautionary statement. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our press release.
Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website.
Please also note that we'll be using combined historical results for the first quarter as defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 2 months, February and March, of N&B results in both the 2020 and 2021 period to allow for comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.
With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We'll begin with our prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas."

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our first quarter results, including a review of our performance by region and segment. I would also like to share with you an update regarding our efforts to integrate the DuPont N&B business, which continues to progress well following the completion of our transaction in February. Rustom will then provide a more detailed financial review of the business, highlighting segment-level business dynamics and performance and cover cash flow and leverage as well.
IFF is off to a strong start in 2021. And I'm confident that the momentum we have built will continue for the remainder of the year and beyond. 
Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our performance and notable developments in the first quarter. We achieved 3% in combined sales growth or 1% on currency neutral basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. Also, because of our change to a fiscal calendar, rather than a traditional 4/4/5 calendar, we have had less 2 days less in first quarter. If we were to normalize for that, our combined currency neutral growth in the first quarter would also have been approximately 3% and on a 2-year average basis to factor in our strong 7% year ago comparison growth would be strong at approximately 5%.
Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 30 basis points, reflecting our team's diligent execution of our cost-management strategy. IFF also continues to generate strong free cash flows, and we remain on track to meet our deleveraging target. For the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.3x.
I'm also pleased to say we have reached an agreement to divest our food preparation business to Frulact, which specializes in fruit preparations for the food and beverage industry. The divestiture is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, pending customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The food preparation business contributed approximately USD 70 million to IFF's Nourish segment pro forma sales in 2020. This is our first step in terms of our portfolio optimization strategy, so I expect more news as we progress through 2021.
As you can see, we have established a solid foundation to carry us forward. We have started with solid momentum, thanks to our disciplined focus on execution. As we have said before, the opportunities in front of us and our mission is to execute on our plan to deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders.
As we move into the second quarter, we remain squarely focused leveraging our new capabilities to reach our business objectives and further establish ourselves as an innovation leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. 
Now on Slide 7, I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that have influenced our first quarter financial results. As you all know, there are notably significant differences in how different countries are managing the continued impacts of the pandemic, so we want to talk to the dynamics we are seeing in our business across the world.
We are pleased to report that most of our operating regions saw sales growth in Q1. In North America, we achieved solid performance across our portfolio with growth in nearly all our segments. This performance in North America reflects the impressive results in our Scent segment. We continue to see healthy performance across our Asian markets, achieving a 6% increase in combined currency neutral sales, primarily driven by double-digit growth in China and India. While we are pleased to see growth across many of these key markets, we must recognize that our growth in India could be challenged in the near term as the country is grappling with hardship related to the pandemic. We wish everyone in India, our Indian colleagues and their loved ones the very best and hope to see rapid improvement in conditions.
In Latin America, we saw an 11% increase in overall sales for the region, with growth primarily driven by local currency sales. Two highlights that I would like to call out in Brazil and -- both grew double digits in Q1.
COVID-19 and related ongoing restrictions continue to heavily impact Western and Central Europe, which has resulted in challenges across the entire EMEA region and a 5% decline in overall sales. That said, we remain optimistic about the region's recovery as global vaccination rates increase and related restrictions ease.
As we press ahead, we will continue to work diligently with our regional teams and communities, particularly those that remain on the most pandemic-related pressure, to adapt our supply chain, ensure that our customers continue to receive the leading solutions they have come to expect. 
Let's move to Slide 8. I would now like to review our first quarter sales performance across IFF's key business segments so you can get a more granular view. We are pleased to report solid growth across our Nourish, Pharma Solutions and Scent divisions. Our largest group, Nourish achieved combined currency neutral sales growth of 1%, led by robust performance in Flavors. We continue to see pandemic-driven headwinds in Food Design, which is driven primarily by continued declines in Food Service. This channel, while improved first quarter trends, was down mid-single digits in the first quarter.
Scent continued its strong performance, achieving combined currency neutral sales growth of 5%, the largest growth driver across our 4 divisions, led by continued strength in consumer fragrances, double-digit growth in cosmetic actives and a strong rebound in Fine Fragrance.
For our Pharma Solutions division, we achieved combined currency neutral sales growth of 3%, with continued strong performance across the entire division and all subcategories.
Our Health & Bioscience division combined currency neutral sales decreased 3% against a strong double-digit year-ago comparison. Increases in both Health and Home and Personal Care were offset by pressures in microbial control and grain processing.
Together, we have an in-demand and diverse portfolio that is meeting the needs of our core end markets. I feel that we are very well positioned to continue executing our ambitious growth initiatives in the complexity of the global marketplace.
Now turning to Slide 9. I want to show a summary that highlights our business performance, particularly with regards to segment-level adjusted operating EBITDA margin. As you know, we are focused on driving overall group operating efficiencies as we execute on our integration plans. Rustom will cover our first quarter segment performance in much more detail, but I wanted to present this slide as it will be included in our standard earnings package going forward, specifically focusing on year-to-year performance.
Some highlights for Q1 that are worth mentioning. Within our largest division, Nourish, I'm very pleased to see early progress on margin expansion. We achieved strong results in our Scent division. The team did a great job driving higher volumes, benefiting from the rebound in Fine Fragrance, which drove favorable mix and continued the effort to capture productivity savings.
In H&B and Pharma Solutions, adjusted operating EBITDA margins were pressured by increased raw materials and logistics costs, which overshadows the strong cost discipline the team has accomplished. 
Now on Slide 10. I would like to provide you with an update on our integration progress with N&B. Since completing our combination in February, we have achieved several financial and organizational integration milestones, which reflect the incredible efforts of our global team. From an organizational perspective, we have established a comprehensive operating and leadership structure for our combined company, having identified and announced roles all the way from CEO down to third-level leaders. These leaders are working closely with the integration management office to ensure that all employees are provided for the tools and resources they need to succeed. We've also completed all IT migration from DuPont to IFF and are on schedule regarding exiting many of our transition service agreements with DuPont.
On the revenue synergy point, we have a robust pipeline of projects, including both cross-selling and integrated solutions that we expect will accelerate our ability to meet our $20 million synergy target this year. This quarter, we achieved a significant cross-selling win within our Health & Bioscience divisions by detergents, and we have invoiced our first years in April. We are pleased with our project pipeline and with the efforts so far and continued expressions of demand from customers. We are confident in our ability to meet our 3-year run rate synergy target of $400 million. 
From a cost synergy perspective, we are underway and already seeing modest P&L benefits. Given we are in early days, we expect these cost savings to increase over the course of the year, putting us well on track to meet our $45 million cost synergy target in the full year 2021 and our year 3 run rate cost synergy target of USD 300 million.
I would now like to pass the call over to Rustom, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance in the first quarter."

First, let me go a bit deeper into our consolidated financial results. In the first quarter, IFF generated $2.5 billion in sales, a 3% combined year-over-year increase, including foreign exchange benefits, or up 1% on a currency neutral basis, primarily led by strong performances in our Scent and Pharma Solutions division. As you may recollect, from 2021 onwards, we are applying prior year average FX rates to our current year non-U.S. dollar revenues to derive currency neutral growth rates. This is the more common practice and makes us more comparable to our competitors.
Our gross margin was impacted in Q1 at Nourish -- and Pharma by higher raw material and logistics cost headwinds arising from input cost inflation and higher freight rates, tight inventories and weather-related plant disruption. Meanwhile, our aggressive cost management program led by headcount and other expense reductions enabled us to improve RSA to sales by 120 basis points and deliver year-on-year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. As an aside, Q1 2020 was our most difficult comp, with 7% combined currency neutral sales growth and strong adjusted operating EBITDA growth. IFF also delivered adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.60 for the first quarter. 
Now on Slide 12. I'd like to discuss the first quarter performance of Nourish, which now includes the enhanced capabilities of N&B's former Food and Beverages business. Nourish sales totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, representing 1% growth on a combined currency neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6%, with a 60 basis point margin expansion led by strong cost management.
Looking at Nourish's performance by business, Flavors drove growth in nearly all our regions. Within Ingredients, which was flat year-over-year, Protein Solutions grew double digits, but this was offset by softness in Emulsifiers and Sweeteners. Continued pandemic-related challenges impacted Food Design, particularly Food Service, which declined mid-single digits year-over-year. 
As the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lessen and retail and away-from-home channels continue to recover, returning to growth in this area while maintaining our strong performance in Nourish and other segments will remain a top priority for the remainder of 2021.
Moving to Health & Biosciences on Slide 13. As Andreas noted, H&B had a combined currency neutral sales decline of 3%, but this was against a robust 11% positive year-over-year comparison. It should be noted that, on a 2-year average basis, currency neutral growth was solid at 4%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was also pressured and operating margin declined by 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower segment volumes and higher raw material and logistics costs.
Our Home & Personal Care business grew strong double digits this quarter, supported by evolving consumer buying trends related to the pandemic that have persisted through Q1, but declined in Animal Nutrition this year when compared to mid-teen growth in the prior year period, offset that performance and impacted overall year-over-year growth. Microbial Control and Grain Processing were also impacted by continued pre-COVID cycling, which impacted H&B's overall growth by approximately 5 percentage points. We are pleased to say that over the course of the first quarter these businesses showed improvement and were positive in April as we cycle the comparable. We are encouraged by the tremendous performance of Home & Personal Care, which is a testament to evolving consumer trends that prioritize individual health more than ever before.
Turning now to Slide 14 to discuss the results of our Scent division. Overall, we are very pleased with Scent's strong performance, which has been a significant contributor to our company-wide growth. Our Scent division generated $569 million in total sales, representing 5% combined currency neutral growth against a strong 7% growth in the year-ago period as well. On a 2-year basis, growth is exceptional at approximately 6%.
Adjusted operating EBITDA improved 8%, with a 70 basis point margin expansion, predominantly driven by volume growth across the entire segment as well as favorable mix from Fine Fragrance recovery and continued productivity. As we began to see last quarter, Our Fine Fragrance business experienced a solid recovery as away-from-home restrictions continue to lift and consumer behavior returned to more traditional levels. Coupled with this rebound, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and mid-teens growth in Cosmetic Actives resulted in another quarter of strong performance for the entire division, driven by volume recovery and new business wins across the segment. Our new call lists are also providing strong contributions with all 3 customers growing double digits in the first quarter.
Now on Slide 15, I would like to discuss the results of Pharma Solutions, our fourth division. As previously mentioned, Pharma Solutions had an impressive quarter of broad-based growth and made a solid contribution to IFF's overall higher Q1 sales. Pharma Solutions delivered $162 million in net sales, representing 3% in combined currency neutral growth, while adjusted operating EBITDA grew 2%. Taken in the context of the 11% growth in the prior year period, growth is impressive on a 2-year basis, average basis, at approximately 7%.
Looking at Pharma Solutions performance by business. Core Pharma and Industrial Pharma led the division with volume growth for metro cell and coatings, providing improving instrumental to core pharma and global specialty solutions and nitro sales supporting the success of industrial pharma. While we're very pleased with Pharma Solutions sales performance in the first quarter, we saw adjusted EBITDA margin decline due to higher cost of goods-related factors. More specifically, gross margin was hurt by higher raw material and logistics costs related to supply chain challenges and force majeures due to the bad weather in the Midwest earlier this year. We had 2 plants shut down temporarily, which impacted raw material availability and caused higher distribution costs.
Now turning to Slide 16. I'd like to review our cash flow dynamics and capital allocation, which remain a top priority. As you will see, our operating cash flow was very strong at $358 million. We are quite pleased with Q1 cash generation. For legacy IFF, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. We typically have net working capital headwinds as we reset off Q4's goals and we make annual bonus payments in March. And this year, we also had large deal-related costs, such as cost to achieve investment banking fees, consulting expenses, et cetera.
A large part of our Q1 success came from core working capital, where we generated $193 million, a great job by our global team and a great outcome, but we don't expect this quarter after quarter as we'd like to build inventory up in some of our legacy N&B business areas to support future growth. 
In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $93 million or 3.5% of sales, up from last Q1's combined comparative $76 million or 2.6% of sales. Free cash flow generation was therefore a strong $265 million, and we distributed $82 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our leverage, which is net debt divided by credit adjusted EBITDA, ended at 4.3x, as Andreas noted, back on Slide 6. This is ahead of our expectation of 4.5x first quarter post-merger leverage.
Now to provide some full year context. Legacy IFF generated $520 million of free cash flow in 2020. And combined, we expect to generate $1 billion in 2021. In 2021, we will invest more in legacy N&B production capacity to meet expected strong future demand, but will only be slightly above our original full year CapEx projection of approximately 4.5% of sales. The dividend payment this year will be at this quarter will be $197 million, reflecting a higher post-merger share count. And we remain on track to meet our long-term deleveraging target of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA in 24 to 36 months from deal close.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to provide an update on our full year 2021 consolidated financial outlook. But before doing so, I want to remind everyone that in mid-April we provided sales and adjusted EBITDA metrics for each of IFF's 4 segments on a 2020 pro forma and combined basis and additional detail on a segment level via our Learning Lab series. We are now in the appendix of this presentation providing an additional look back at the combined company's historical quarterly results for 2020 as part of our commitment to transparency and helping our shareholders understand the new IFF.
On a combined basis, IFF generated $10.6 billion of revenue for the full year 2020, with currency neutral growth of approximately 2%. And our combined adjusted operating EBITDA margin for 2020 was approximately 22%. Please remember that combined includes 11 months of N&B and 12 months of IFF in 2020 and 2021.
In our fourth quarter conference call in February, we gave initial pro forma guidance, which assumed the full 12 months of IFF and N&B, in order to be directly comparable to our previously provided S-4. Moving forward, to be more aligned with actual results and reporting, we are transitioning to guiding on 11 months of N&B, which excludes January, and 12 months of IFF in the 2021 year, in light of the merger completing on Feb 1. Also, please note that in January 2021 N&B's actual sales were approximately $507 million and adjusted operating EBITDA was $107 million. Given our first quarter results, our April preliminary sales, our rest of year FX expectations, incremental pricing to recover costs and the fact that Q1 was our toughest comparative period quarter, we are forecasting stronger sales growth through the rest of 2021. We have, therefore, increased our sales expectation for 2021 to be approximately $11.25 billion in combined revenues 
[Audio Gap]
or plus 6 points growth with an approximately freight costs are higher as a result of greatly increased rates. For example, the global freight index is up 3x due to nonavailability of containers at contracted rates. And we're also seeing an uplift in airfreight volumes due to strong demand and supply chain challenges like force Majeure earlier this year.
This has required us to go back to have additional pricing discussions to cover our exposure. While we are confident that over time we can fully pass along the increase, there is a time lag before pricing is fully realized, which can pressure gross margin in the short term. Ultimately, by the end of the year, we are confident that, through pricing and our ongoing focus on cost reduction, we can achieve our full year adjusted operating EBITDA goal on a combined basis.
With regard to Q2, we are pleased that we've started the quarter strong, a nice growth acceleration versus where we ended the first quarter. We're optimistic that for the full second quarter revenue growth, including currency benefits, should be in the high single digits range with an adjusted EBITDA margin also around 23%.
To assist with understanding and modeling the new IFF, we are also sharing our expectations with regard to depreciation, amortization, interest expenses, CapEx, adjusted effective tax rate excluding amortization and our weighted average share count, all on a combined basis. While most of these metrics probably don't need to be elaborated upon, it's worth noting that we expect moderately higher CapEx in 2021 as we invest for growth and work to exit some of our IT-related transition services agreements with DuPont more quickly than planned. We're also providing a 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization, for the first time. And the 21.5% is broadly in line with our early expectations. This is still preliminary and will change as we finalize purchase accounting and intangibles by jurisdiction. The equivalent for heritage IFF on a similar basis for the full year 2020 was approximately 18.5%.
Collectively, these metrics and decisions reflect our confidence in IFF's ability to deliver solid results even in this volatile global environment. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Andreas, who will provide some closing remarks."

It has truly been a busy quarter. And we all have much to be proud of especially as this all was accomplished during a global pandemic.
Looking beyond our solid Q1 financial results, I want to reemphasize the important first step that we took in tightening our business and optimizing our portfolio strategy by agreeing to divest our Food Preparation business. By divesting this noncore business, IFF will be more efficient organization with a greater capacity to focus on growth and innovation across our key businesses, ultimately generating greater value for our shareholders.
As we enter Q2 together, we are confident that we have the right team and the right structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operational goals. As I mentioned, we are targeting strong year-over-year financial improvements with accelerated sales growth over the coming quarters, backed by our commitment to delivering industry-leading innovative products and services to our customers around the world. And as Rustom stated, we are pleased that we have started Q2 strong and are optimistic that our full second quarter sales growth should be in a high single-digit range.
I'm tremendously proud of all we have accomplished, and I firmly believe that the best is yet to come. We're taking each and every learning from the N&B integration process to create a stronger, more agile and diversified company that defines the future of our industry and showcase what it means to be a leading ingredients and solutions partner.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

If you go to the Health & Bioscience business, here you see a couple of elements. You see that Health and the Cultures & Food Enzyme business should grow mid-single digits. And you will see a recovery of the Microbial Control business, which was very much hurt by the situation last year. So that's important as well.
And then on the Nourish side, very solid performance on taste, particularly the legacy flavors doing very well. But on the new parts, Protein Solutions, alternative proteins, are going very well. And then you will see a turnaround in the Food Service as well as the countries and economies are opening up. And that's probably a general remark. We have seen good growth, as you have seen in the presentation, in most of the regions. But in Europe -- and Europe will turn around as soon as these economies are opening up after the pandemic as well. So I hope, Mike, that gives you a bit more color here."

I guess a broader question. It's something that we hear probably most frequently from folks out there asking about your companies why -- or what gives confidence that IFF can sustain the share gains implied by the 4% to 5% currency neutral long-term targets that you have when growth has been below peers in recent years, even adjusting for FX changes? And I guess related to that, first quarter growth was below peers who also had tough comparisons, not as tough as yours, but still tougher comparison. So what gives confidence that you can see an acceleration implied by the guidance over balance of the year as well as longer term?
And I want to just kind of squeeze in a related question which is just, how do we measure or how do you measure maybe your peer performance? What does the group that you use to measure your share performance versus peers. And traditionally, it's been JV and Symrise. Now it's as [indiscernible] who should we all be paying attention to?"

Maybe you should put Carry in the mix as well, in particular for food service and some of the ingredients. And then you have actually a very nice peer group together. So what we want to do on the midterm is actually what we are doing -- we have done completely our strategic assessment of all the categories where we believe that we have growth and margin potential. We certainly will emphasize in terms of our resources behind these categories. Some of these categories are just, for example, in health, like the probiotics business, for example, where we put good resources behind to make sure that we can outgrow the competition here. 
And I think if you look at the start into the year, it's 3% growth if you adjust for the days. And there was a very strong comparison of 7% in the last year. So we're actually quite happy with the start, and we have seen some of the portfolio pieces are performing very well, like the Flavors business is coming well. You see it in the -- everything which is plant-based and protein-related. And we see some, let's say, turnaround as well. And I mentioned before when Mike Sison asked, on the Microbial Control, which is coming back. We see the Food Service business are coming back. And these are all good signals that we are on a really solid track now to accelerate our growth. And that's the reason why we said we raised our expectation for the rest of the year."

For example, we can use our modulation technology for that to reduce cost for sweeteners in their products. But also in terms of our new platforms, we have now really the leading biotech platform, and that gives us really endless opportunities to use their fermentation technology, reduce import cost and basically create some of the ingredient by biotech pathways.

As we go forward in the year, we'll actually be building inventory at legacy N&B to satisfy demand, invest in the stream and our supply chain. And also the raw material cost increases we're talking about are going to increase the dollars on hand, right? I mean, DSO pretty stable through the rest of the year. And so we haven't specifically forecast core working capital. But basically, by the end of the year, I would think we'd expect it to go up a little bit. And that's all factored in.

We might see a bit of a normalization, but we still expect good growth and maybe single-digit growth in that very important category. 
Another, let's say, category where we have very strong comparables is probiotics. You might have seen this for a couple of months. It was for legacy N&B double-digit growth last year. So we will see a normalization here, but still growth in the mid-single-digit range going forward. So these are the 2 categories which I would call out.

We have seen, let's say, in Q1, for example, on the Health & Bioscience piece, really double-digit growth. And as soon as that normalizes, we will see good growth coming out of H&B as well. Because the underlying business is actually very good, and the demand is strong.
On the pricing side, it's basically a pass-through. As you were saying, it's easier to raise prices compared with some of the legacy F&F businesses. And so the time lag is not as long as it is for some of the F&F businesses. I hope that answers the question, the first part."

Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.
I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we are making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook based on the current state and our expectations for 2021. These statements contain elements of uncertainty, which we have laid out on Slide 2 under the cautionary statement. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our press release.
Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website.
Please also note that we'll be using combined historical results for the first quarter as defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 2 months, February and March, of N&B results in both the 2020 and 2021 period to allow for comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our first quarter results, including a review of our performance by region and segment. I would also like to share with you an update regarding our efforts to integrate the DuPont N&B business, which continues to progress well following the completion of our transaction in February. Rustom will then provide a more detailed financial review of the business, highlighting segment-level business dynamics and performance and cover cash flow and leverage as well.
IFF is off to a strong start in 2021. And I'm confident that the momentum we have built will continue for the remainder of the year and beyond. 
Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our performance and notable developments in the first quarter. We achieved 3% in combined sales growth or 1% on currency neutral basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. Also, because of our change to a fiscal calendar, rather than a traditional 4/4/5 calendar, we have had less 2 days less in first quarter. If we were to normalize for that, our combined currency neutral growth in the first quarter would also have been approximately 3% and on a 2-year average basis to factor in our strong 7% year ago comparison growth would be strong at approximately 5%.
Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 30 basis points, reflecting our team's diligent execution of our cost-management strategy. IFF also continues to generate strong free cash flows, and we remain on track to meet our deleveraging target. For the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.3x.
I'm also pleased to say we have reached an agreement to divest our food preparation business to Frulact, which specializes in fruit preparations for the food and beverage industry. The divestiture is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, pending customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The food preparation business contributed approximately USD 70 million to IFF's Nourish segment pro forma sales in 2020. This is our first step in terms of our portfolio optimization strategy, so I expect more news as we progress through 2021.
As you can see, we have established a solid foundation to carry us forward. We have started with solid momentum, thanks to our disciplined focus on execution. As we have said before, the opportunities in front of us and our mission is to execute on our plan to deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders.
As we move into the second quarter, we remain squarely focused leveraging our new capabilities to reach our business objectives and further establish ourselves as an innovation leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. 
Now on Slide 7, I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that have influenced our first quarter financial results. As you all know, there are notably significant differences in how different countries are managing the continued impacts of the pandemic, so we want to talk to the dynamics we are seeing in our business across the world.
We are pleased to report that most of our operating regions saw sales growth in Q1. In North America, we achieved solid performance across our portfolio with growth in nearly all our segments. This performance in North America reflects the impressive results in our Scent segment. We continue to see healthy performance across our Asian markets, achieving a 6% increase in combined currency neutral sales, primarily driven by double-digit growth in China and India. While we are pleased to see growth across many of these key markets, we must recognize that our growth in India could be challenged in the near term as the country is grappling with hardship related to the pandemic. We wish everyone in India, our Indian colleagues and their loved ones the very best and hope to see rapid improvement in conditions.
In Latin America, we saw an 11% increase in overall sales for the region, with growth primarily driven by local currency sales. Two highlights that I would like to call out in Brazil and -- both grew double digits in Q1.
COVID-19 and related ongoing restrictions continue to heavily impact Western and Central Europe, which has resulted in challenges across the entire EMEA region and a 5% decline in overall sales. That said, we remain optimistic about the region's recovery as global vaccination rates increase and related restrictions ease.
As we press ahead, we will continue to work diligently with our regional teams and communities, particularly those that remain on the most pandemic-related pressure, to adapt our supply chain, ensure that our customers continue to receive the leading solutions they have come to expect. 
Let's move to Slide 8. I would now like to review our first quarter sales performance across IFF's key business segments so you can get a more granular view. We are pleased to report solid growth across our Nourish, Pharma Solutions and Scent divisions. Our largest group, Nourish achieved combined currency neutral sales growth of 1%, led by robust performance in Flavors. We continue to see pandemic-driven headwinds in Food Design, which is driven primarily by continued declines in Food Service. This channel, while improved first quarter trends, was down mid-single digits in the first quarter.
Scent continued its strong performance, achieving combined currency neutral sales growth of 5%, the largest growth driver across our 4 divisions, led by continued strength in consumer fragrances, double-digit growth in cosmetic actives and a strong rebound in Fine Fragrance.
For our Pharma Solutions division, we achieved combined currency neutral sales growth of 3%, with continued strong performance across the entire division and all subcategories.
Our Health & Bioscience division combined currency neutral sales decreased 3% against a strong double-digit year-ago comparison. Increases in both Health and Home and Personal Care were offset by pressures in microbial control and grain processing.
Together, we have an in-demand and diverse portfolio that is meeting the needs of our core end markets. I feel that we are very well positioned to continue executing our ambitious growth initiatives in the complexity of the global marketplace.
Now turning to Slide 9. I want to show a summary that highlights our business performance, particularly with regards to segment-level adjusted operating EBITDA margin. As you know, we are focused on driving overall group operating efficiencies as we execute on our integration plans. Rustom will cover our first quarter segment performance in much more detail, but I wanted to present this slide as it will be included in our standard earnings package going forward, specifically focusing on year-to-year performance.
Some highlights for Q1 that are worth mentioning. Within our largest division, Nourish, I'm very pleased to see early progress on margin expansion. We achieved strong results in our Scent division. The team did a great job driving higher volumes, benefiting from the rebound in Fine Fragrance, which drove favorable mix and continued the effort to capture productivity savings.
In H&B and Pharma Solutions, adjusted operating EBITDA margins were pressured by increased raw materials and logistics costs, which overshadows the strong cost discipline the team has accomplished. 
Now on Slide 10. I would like to provide you with an update on our integration progress with N&B. Since completing our combination in February, we have achieved several financial and organizational integration milestones, which reflect the incredible efforts of our global team. From an organizational perspective, we have established a comprehensive operating and leadership structure for our combined company, having identified and announced roles all the way from CEO down to third-level leaders. These leaders are working closely with the integration management office to ensure that all employees are provided for the tools and resources they need to succeed. We've also completed all IT migration from DuPont to IFF and are on schedule regarding exiting many of our transition service agreements with DuPont.
On the revenue synergy point, we have a robust pipeline of projects, including both cross-selling and integrated solutions that we expect will accelerate our ability to meet our $20 million synergy target this year. This quarter, we achieved a significant cross-selling win within our Health & Bioscience divisions by detergents, and we have invoiced our first years in April. We are pleased with our project pipeline and with the efforts so far and continued expressions of demand from customers. We are confident in our ability to meet our 3-year run rate synergy target of $400 million. 
From a cost synergy perspective, we are underway and already seeing modest P&L benefits. Given we are in early days, we expect these cost savings to increase over the course of the year, putting us well on track to meet our $45 million cost synergy target in the full year 2021 and our year 3 run rate cost synergy target of USD 300 million.
I would now like to pass the call over to Rustom, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance in the first quarter."

First, let me go a bit deeper into our consolidated financial results. In the first quarter, IFF generated $2.5 billion in sales, a 3% combined year-over-year increase, including foreign exchange benefits, or up 1% on a currency neutral basis, primarily led by strong performances in our Scent and Pharma Solutions division. As you may recollect, from 2021 onwards, we are applying prior year average FX rates to our current year non-U.S. dollar revenues to derive currency neutral growth rates. This is the more common practice and makes us more comparable to our competitors.
Our gross margin was impacted in Q1 at Nourish -- and Pharma by higher raw material and logistics cost headwinds arising from input cost inflation and higher freight rates, tight inventories and weather-related plant disruption. Meanwhile, our aggressive cost management program led by headcount and other expense reductions enabled us to improve RSA to sales by 120 basis points and deliver year-on-year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. As an aside, Q1 2020 was our most difficult comp, with 7% combined currency neutral sales growth and strong adjusted operating EBITDA growth. IFF also delivered adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.60 for the first quarter. 
Now on Slide 12. I'd like to discuss the first quarter performance of Nourish, which now includes the enhanced capabilities of N&B's former Food and Beverages business. Nourish sales totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, representing 1% growth on a combined currency neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6%, with a 60 basis point margin expansion led by strong cost management.
Looking at Nourish's performance by business, Flavors drove growth in nearly all our regions. Within Ingredients, which was flat year-over-year, Protein Solutions grew double digits, but this was offset by softness in Emulsifiers and Sweeteners. Continued pandemic-related challenges impacted Food Design, particularly Food Service, which declined mid-single digits year-over-year. 
As the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lessen and retail and away-from-home channels continue to recover, returning to growth in this area while maintaining our strong performance in Nourish and other segments will remain a top priority for the remainder of 2021.
Moving to Health & Biosciences on Slide 13. As Andreas noted, H&B had a combined currency neutral sales decline of 3%, but this was against a robust 11% positive year-over-year comparison. It should be noted that, on a 2-year average basis, currency neutral growth was solid at 4%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was also pressured and operating margin declined by 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower segment volumes and higher raw material and logistics costs.
Our Home & Personal Care business grew strong double digits this quarter, supported by evolving consumer buying trends related to the pandemic that have persisted through Q1, but declined in Animal Nutrition this year when compared to mid-teen growth in the prior year period, offset that performance and impacted overall year-over-year growth. Microbial Control and Grain Processing were also impacted by continued pre-COVID cycling, which impacted H&B's overall growth by approximately 5 percentage points. We are pleased to say that over the course of the first quarter these businesses showed improvement and were positive in April as we cycle the comparable. We are encouraged by the tremendous performance of Home & Personal Care, which is a testament to evolving consumer trends that prioritize individual health more than ever before.
Turning now to Slide 14 to discuss the results of our Scent division. Overall, we are very pleased with Scent's strong performance, which has been a significant contributor to our company-wide growth. Our Scent division generated $569 million in total sales, representing 5% combined currency neutral growth against a strong 7% growth in the year-ago period as well. On a 2-year basis, growth is exceptional at approximately 6%.
Adjusted operating EBITDA improved 8%, with a 70 basis point margin expansion, predominantly driven by volume growth across the entire segment as well as favorable mix from Fine Fragrance recovery and continued productivity. As we began to see last quarter, Our Fine Fragrance business experienced a solid recovery as away-from-home restrictions continue to lift and consumer behavior returned to more traditional levels. Coupled with this rebound, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and mid-teens growth in Cosmetic Actives resulted in another quarter of strong performance for the entire division, driven by volume recovery and new business wins across the segment. Our new call lists are also providing strong contributions with all 3 customers growing double digits in the first quarter.
Now on Slide 15, I would like to discuss the results of Pharma Solutions, our fourth division. As previously mentioned, Pharma Solutions had an impressive quarter of broad-based growth and made a solid contribution to IFF's overall higher Q1 sales. Pharma Solutions delivered $162 million in net sales, representing 3% in combined currency neutral growth, while adjusted operating EBITDA grew 2%. Taken in the context of the 11% growth in the prior year period, growth is impressive on a 2-year basis, average basis, at approximately 7%.
Looking at Pharma Solutions performance by business. Core Pharma and Industrial Pharma led the division with volume growth for metro cell and coatings, providing improving instrumental to core pharma and global specialty solutions and nitro sales supporting the success of industrial pharma. While we're very pleased with Pharma Solutions sales performance in the first quarter, we saw adjusted EBITDA margin decline due to higher cost of goods-related factors. More specifically, gross margin was hurt by higher raw material and logistics costs related to supply chain challenges and force majeures due to the bad weather in the Midwest earlier this year. We had 2 plants shut down temporarily, which impacted raw material availability and caused higher distribution costs.
Now turning to Slide 16. I'd like to review our cash flow dynamics and capital allocation, which remain a top priority. As you will see, our operating cash flow was very strong at $358 million. We are quite pleased with Q1 cash generation. For legacy IFF, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. We typically have net working capital headwinds as we reset off Q4's goals and we make annual bonus payments in March. And this year, we also had large deal-related costs, such as cost to achieve investment banking fees, consulting expenses, et cetera.
A large part of our Q1 success came from core working capital, where we generated $193 million, a great job by our global team and a great outcome, but we don't expect this quarter after quarter as we'd like to build inventory up in some of our legacy N&B business areas to support future growth. 
In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $93 million or 3.5% of sales, up from last Q1's combined comparative $76 million or 2.6% of sales. Free cash flow generation was therefore a strong $265 million, and we distributed $82 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our leverage, which is net debt divided by credit adjusted EBITDA, ended at 4.3x, as Andreas noted, back on Slide 6. This is ahead of our expectation of 4.5x first quarter post-merger leverage.
Now to provide some full year context. Legacy IFF generated $520 million of free cash flow in 2020. And combined, we expect to generate $1 billion in 2021. In 2021, we will invest more in legacy N&B production capacity to meet expected strong future demand, but will only be slightly above our original full year CapEx projection of approximately 4.5% of sales. The dividend payment this year will be at this quarter will be $197 million, reflecting a higher post-merger share count. And we remain on track to meet our long-term deleveraging target of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA in 24 to 36 months from deal close.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to provide an update on our full year 2021 consolidated financial outlook. But before doing so, I want to remind everyone that in mid-April we provided sales and adjusted EBITDA metrics for each of IFF's 4 segments on a 2020 pro forma and combined basis and additional detail on a segment level via our Learning Lab series. We are now in the appendix of this presentation providing an additional look back at the combined company's historical quarterly results for 2020 as part of our commitment to transparency and helping our shareholders understand the new IFF.
On a combined basis, IFF generated $10.6 billion of revenue for the full year 2020, with currency neutral growth of approximately 2%. And our combined adjusted operating EBITDA margin for 2020 was approximately 22%. Please remember that combined includes 11 months of N&B and 12 months of IFF in 2020 and 2021.
In our fourth quarter conference call in February, we gave initial pro forma guidance, which assumed the full 12 months of IFF and N&B, in order to be directly comparable to our previously provided S-4. Moving forward, to be more aligned with actual results and reporting, we are transitioning to guiding on 11 months of N&B, which excludes January, and 12 months of IFF in the 2021 year, in light of the merger completing on Feb 1. Also, please note that in January 2021 N&B's actual sales were approximately $507 million and adjusted operating EBITDA was $107 million. Given our first quarter results, our April preliminary sales, our rest of year FX expectations, incremental pricing to recover costs and the fact that Q1 was our toughest comparative period quarter, we are forecasting stronger sales growth through the rest of 2021. We have, therefore, increased our sales expectation for 2021 to be approximately $11.25 billion in combined revenues or plus 6%  growth with an approximately 23% adjusted operating EBITDA margin. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a rise in the cost of goods, driven by input costs, including raw materials and logistics. In terms of raw material costs, we are seeing a large increase in selected commodities, soy, low-cost bean kernel, vegetable oil, turpentine and propylene glycol. In addition,
freight costs are higher as a result of greatly increased rates. For example, the global freight index is up 3x due to nonavailability of containers at contracted rates. And we're also seeing an uplift in airfreight volumes due to strong demand and supply chain challenges like force Majeure earlier this year.
This has required us to go back to have additional pricing discussions to cover our exposure. While we are confident that over time we can fully pass along the increase, there is a time lag before pricing is fully realized, which can pressure gross margin in the short term. Ultimately, by the end of the year, we are confident that, through pricing and our ongoing focus on cost reduction, we can achieve our full year adjusted operating EBITDA goal on a combined basis.
With regard to Q2, we are pleased that we've started the quarter strong, a nice growth acceleration versus where we ended the first quarter. We're optimistic that for the full second quarter revenue growth, including currency benefits, should be in the high single digits range with an adjusted EBITDA margin also around 23%.
To assist with understanding and modeling the new IFF, we are also sharing our expectations with regard to depreciation, amortization, interest expenses, CapEx, adjusted effective tax rate excluding amortization and our weighted average share count, all on a combined basis. While most of these metrics probably don't need to be elaborated upon, it's worth noting that we expect moderately higher CapEx in 2021 as we invest for growth and work to exit some of our IT-related transition services agreements with DuPont more quickly than planned. We're also providing a 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization, for the first time. And the 21.5% is broadly in line with our early expectations. This is still preliminary and will change as we finalize purchase accounting and intangibles by jurisdiction. The equivalent for heritage IFF on a similar basis for the full year 2020 was approximately 18.5%.
Collectively, these metrics and decisions reflect our confidence in IFF's ability to deliver solid results even in this volatile global environment. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Andreas, who will provide some closing remarks."

I would like to wrap up today's call by first giving an enormous thank you to our thousands of employees around the world who have worked tirelessly over the last quarter to successfully execute our business initiatives, deliver for our customers and achieve solid top and bottom line business results, all while making exceptional strides integrating N&B into the IFF family. It has truly been a busy quarter. And we all have much to be proud of especially as this all was accomplished during a global pandemic.
Looking beyond our solid Q1 financial results, I want to reemphasize the important first step that we took in tightening our business and optimizing our portfolio strategy by agreeing to divest our Food Preparation business. By divesting this noncore business, IFF will be more efficient organization with a greater capacity to focus on growth and innovation across our key businesses, ultimately generating greater value for our shareholders.
As we enter Q2 together, we are confident that we have the right team and the right structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operational goals. As I mentioned, we are targeting strong year-over-year financial improvements with accelerated sales growth over the coming quarters, backed by our commitment to delivering industry-leading innovative products and services to our customers around the world. And as Rustom stated, we are pleased that we have started Q2 strong and are optimistic that our full second quarter sales growth should be in a high single-digit range.
I'm tremendously proud of all we have accomplished, and I firmly believe that the best is yet to come. We're taking each and every learning from the N&B integration process to create a stronger, more agile and diversified company that defines the future of our industry and showcase what it means to be a leading ingredients and solutions partner.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

Yes, first of all, I think that we really expect that the growth will accelerate over the course of the year. And that's driven us, as Rustom said, as well, with a good start into the second quarter, which was actually -- the first quarter was our toughest comparison. So that's the reason why we raised our sales expectations for the year. I think that's important.
So now coming to the different parts of the business, I would say, first of all, we see -- if you look at the Scent business unit, a real good recovery on Fine Fragrances, which is really fantastic, in the first quarter and also start in the second quarter, which is good. We see still a great growth on Cosmetic Actives. So that's basically super important for us as well. And the Consumer Fragrances stay on an elevated level.
If you go to the Health & Bioscience business, here you see a couple of elements. You see that Health and the Cultures & Food Enzyme business should grow mid-single digits. And you will see a recovery of the Microbial Control business, which was very much hurt by the situation last year. So that's important as well.
And then on the Nourish side, very solid performance on taste, particularly the legacy flavors doing very well. But on the new parts, Protein Solutions, alternative proteins, are going very well. And then you will see a turnaround in the Food Service as well as the countries and economies are opening up. And that's probably a general remark. We have seen good growth, as you have seen in the presentation, in most of the regions. But in Europe -- and Europe will turn around as soon as these economies are opening up after the pandemic as well. So I hope, Mike, that gives you a bit more color here."

I guess a broader question. It's something that we hear probably most frequently from folks out there asking about your companies why -- or what gives confidence that IFF can sustain the share gains implied by the 4% to 5% currency neutral long-term targets that you have when growth has been below peers in recent years, even adjusting for FX changes? And I guess related to that, first quarter growth was below peers who also had tough comparisons, not as tough as yours, but still tougher comparison. So what gives confidence that you can see an acceleration implied by the guidance over balance of the year as well as longer term?
And I want to just kind of squeeze in a related question which is just, how do we measure or how do you measure maybe your peer performance? What does the group that you use to measure your share performance versus peers. And traditionally, it's been JV and Symrise. Now it's as [indiscernible] who should we all be paying attention to?"

Maybe you should put Carry in the mix as well, in particular for food service and some of the ingredients. And then you have actually a very nice peer group together. So what we want to do on the midterm is actually what we are doing -- we have done completely our strategic assessment of all the categories where we believe that we have growth and margin potential. We certainly will emphasize in terms of our resources behind these categories. Some of these categories are just, for example, in health, like the probiotics business, for example, where we put good resources behind to make sure that we can outgrow the competition here. 
And I think if you look at the start into the year, it's 3% growth if you adjust for the days. And there was a very strong comparison of 7% in the last year. So we're actually quite happy with the start, and we have seen some of the portfolio pieces are performing very well, like the Flavors business is coming well. You see it in the -- everything which is plant-based and protein-related. And we see some, let's say, turnaround as well. And I mentioned before when Mike Sison asked, on the Microbial Control, which is coming back. We see the Food Service business are coming back. And these are all good signals that we are on a really solid track now to accelerate our growth. And that's the reason why we said we raised our expectation for the rest of the year."

However, I mean, we do have positives. We do have positives coming from FX coming through. We do have positives from higher sales volumes, and we do have the positives from lower RSA as a percentage of sales. So on operating margin perspective that reduces the negative down quite a bit.

Another, let's say, category where we have very strong comparables is probiotics. You might have seen this for a couple of months. It was for legacy N&B double-digit growth last year.

Because the underlying business is actually very good, and the demand is strong.
On the pricing side, it's basically a pass-through. As you were saying, it's easier to raise prices compared with some of the legacy F&F businesses. And so the time lag is not as long as it is for some of the F&F businesses. I hope that answers the question, the first part."

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the first quarter as well as our outlook for the full year 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. 
Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. 
I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we are making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook based on the current state and our expectations for 2021. These statements contain elements of uncertainty, which we have laid out on Slide 2 under the cautionary statement. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our press release. 
Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website. 
Please also note that we'll be using combined historical results for the first quarter as defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 2 months, February and March, of N&B results in both the 2020 and 2021 period to allow for comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021. 
With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We'll begin with our prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas."

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our first quarter results, including a review of our performance by region and segment. I would also like to share with you an update regarding our efforts to integrate the DuPont N&B business, which continues to progress well following the completion of our transaction in February. Rustom will then provide a more detailed financial review of the business, highlighting segment-level business dynamics and performance and cover cash flow and leverage as well. 
IFF is off to a strong start in 2021. And I'm confident that the momentum we have built will continue for the remainder of the year and beyond.  
Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our performance and notable developments in the first quarter. We achieved 3% in combined sales growth or 1% on currency neutral basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. Also, because of our change to our fiscal calendar, rather than a traditional 4/4/5 calendar, we have had less -- 2 days less in first quarter. If we were to normalize for that, our combined currency neutral growth in the first quarter would also have been approximately 3% and on a 2-year average basis to factor in our strong 7% year ago comparison, growth would be strong at approximately 5%. 
Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 30 basis points, reflecting our team's diligent execution of our cost-management strategy. IFF also continues to generate strong free cash flows, and we remain on track to meet our deleveraging target. For the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.3x. 
I'm also pleased to say we have reached an agreement to divest our fruit preparation business to Frulact, which specializes in fruit preparations for the food and beverage industry. The divestiture is expected to close in the third quarter 2021, pending customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The fruit preparation business contributed approximately USD 70 million to IFF's Nourish segment pro forma sales in 2020. This is our first step in terms of our portfolio optimization strategy, so I expect more news as we progress through 2021. 
As you can see, we have established a solid foundation to carry us forward. We have started with solid momentum, thanks to our disciplined focus on execution. As we have said before, the opportunities in front of us and our mission is to execute on our plan to deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. 
As we move into the second quarter, we remain squarely focused leveraging our new capabilities to reach our business objectives and further establish ourselves as an innovation leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products.  
Now on Slide 7, I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that have influenced our first quarter financial results. As you all know, there are notably significant differences in how different countries are managing the continued impacts of the pandemic, so we want to talk to the dynamics we are seeing in our business across the world. 
We are pleased to report that most of our operating regions saw sales growth in Q1. In North America, we achieved solid performance across our portfolio with growth in nearly all our segments. This performance in North America reflects the impressive results in our Scent segment. We continue to see healthy performance across our Asian markets, achieving a 6% increase in combined currency neutral sales, primarily driven by double-digit growth in China and India. While we are pleased to see growth across many of these key markets, we must recognize that our growth in India could be challenged in the near term as the country is grappling with hardship related to the pandemic. We wish everyone in India, our Indian colleagues and their loved ones the very best and hope to see rapid improvement in conditions. 
In Latin America, we saw an 11% increase in overall sales for the region, with growth primarily driven by local currency sales. Two highlights that I would like to call out in Brazil and South Cone, both grew double digits in Q1. 
COVID-19 and related ongoing restrictions continue to heavily impact Western and Central Europe, which has resulted in challenges across the entire EMEA region and a 5% decline in overall sales. That said, we remain optimistic about the region's recovery as global vaccination rates increase and related restrictions ease. 
As we press ahead, we will continue to work diligently with our regional teams and communities, particularly those that remain on the most pandemic-related pressure, to adapt our supply chain, ensure that our customers continue to receive the leading solutions they have come to expect.  
Let's move to Slide 8. I would now like to review our first quarter sales performance across IFF's key business segments so you can get a more granular view. We are pleased to report solid growth across our Nourish, Pharma Solutions and Scent divisions. Our largest group, Nourish achieved combined currency neutral sales growth of 1%, led by robust performance in Flavors. We continue to see pandemic-driven headwinds in Food Design, which is driven primarily by continued declines in Food Service. This channel, while improved from the first quarter trends, was down mid-single digits in the first quarter. 
Scent continued its strong performance, achieving combined currency neutral sales growth of 5%, the largest growth driver across our 4 divisions, led by continued strength in Consumer Fragrances, double-digit growth in Cosmetic Actives and a strong rebound in Fine Fragrance. 
For our Pharma Solutions division, we achieved combined currency neutral sales growth of 3%, with continued strong performance across the entire division and all subcategories. 
Our Health & Bioscience division combined currency neutral sales decreased 3% against a strong double-digit year-ago comparison. Increases in both Health and Home & Personal Care were offset by pressures in Microbial Control and Grain Processing. 
Together, we have an in-demand and diverse portfolio that is meeting the needs of our core end markets. I feel that we are very well positioned to continue executing our ambitious growth initiatives in the complexity of the global marketplace. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I want to show a summary that highlights our business performance, particularly with regards to segment-level adjusted operating EBITDA margin.  As you know, we are focused on driving overall group operating efficiencies as we execute on our integration plans. Rustom will cover our first quarter segment performance in much more detail, but I wanted to present this slide as it will be included in our standard earnings package going forward, specifically focusing on year-to-year performance.
Some highlights for Q1 that are worth mentioning. Within our largest division, Nourish, I'm very pleased to see early progress on margin expansion. We achieved strong results in our Scent division. The team did a great job driving higher volumes, benefiting from the rebound in Fine Fragrance, which drove favorable mix and continued the effort to capture productivity savings.
In H&B and Pharma Solutions, adjusted operating EBITDA margins were pressured by increased raw materials and logistics costs, which overshadowed the strong cost discipline the team has accomplished. 
Now on Slide 10. I would like to provide you with an update on our integration progress with N&B. Since completing our combination in February, we have achieved several financial and organizational integration milestones, which reflect the incredible efforts of our global team. From an organizational perspective, we have established a comprehensive operating and leadership structure for our combined company, having identified and announced roles all the way from CEO down t third-level leaders. These leaders are working closely with the integration management office to ensure that all employees are provided with the tools and resources they need to succeed. We've also completed all IT migration from DuPont to IFF and are on schedule regarding exiting many of our transition service agreements with DuPont.
On the revenue synergy front, we have a robust pipeline of projects, including both cross-selling and integrated solutions that we expect will accelerate our ability to meet our $20 million synergy target this year. This quarter, we achieved a significant cross-selling win within our Health & Bioscience divisions via detergents, and we have invoiced our first sales in April. We are pleased with our project pipeline and with the efforts so far and continued expressions of demand from customers. We are confident in our ability to meet our 3-year run rate synergy target of $400 million. 
From a cost synergy perspective, we are underway and already seeing modest P&L benefits. Given we are in early days, we expect these cost savings to increase over the course of the year, putting us well on track to meet our $45 million cost synergy target in the full year 2021 and our year 3 run rate cost synergy target of USD 300 million.
I would now like to pass the call over to Rustom, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance in the first quarter."

First, let me go a bit deeper into our consolidated financial results.  In the first quarter, IFF generated $2.5 billion in sales, a 3% combined year-over-year increase, including foreign exchange benefits, or up 1% on a currency neutral basis, primarily led by strong performances in our Scent and Pharma Solutions divisions. As you may recollect, from 2021 onwards, we are applying prior year average FX rates to our current year non-U.S. dollar revenues to derive currency neutral growth rates. This is the more common practice and makes us more comparable to our competitors.
Our gross margin was impacted in Q1 at Nourish, H&B and Pharma by higher raw material and logistics cost headwinds arising from input cost inflation and higher freight rates, tight inventories and weather-related plant disruptions. Meanwhile, our aggressive cost management program led by headcount and other expense reductions enabled us to improve RSA to sales by 120 basis points and deliver year-on-year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. As an aside, Q1 2020 was our most difficult comp, with 7% combined currency neutral sales growth and strong adjusted operating EBITDA growth. IFF also delivered adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.60 for the first quarter. 
Now on Slide 12. I'd like to discuss the first quarter performance of Nourish, which now includes the enhanced capabilities of N&B's former Food and Beverages business. Nourish sales totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, representing 1% growth on a combined currency neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6%, with a 60 basis point margin expansion led by strong cost management.
Looking at Nourish's performance by business, Flavors drove growth in nearly all our regions. Within Ingredients, which was flat year-over-year, Protein Solutions grew double digits, but this was offset by softness in Emulsifiers and Sweeteners. Continued pandemic-related challenges impacted Food Design, particularly Food Service, which declined mid-single digits year-over-year. 
As the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lessen and retail and away-from-home channels continue to recover, returning to growth in this area while maintaining our strong performance in Nourish and other segments will remain a top priority for the remainder of 2021.
Moving to Health & Biosciences on Slide 13. As Andreas noted, H&B had a combined currency neutral sales decline of 3%, but this was against a robust 11% positive year-over-year comparison. It should be noted that, on a 2-year average basis, currency neutral growth was solid at 4%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was also pressured and operating margin declined by 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower segment volumes and higher raw material and logistics costs.
Our Home & Personal Care business grew strong double digits this quarter, supported by evolving consumer buying trends related to the pandemic that have persisted through Q1. But declines in Animal Nutrition this year, when compared to mid-teen growth in the prior year period, offset that performance and impacted overall year-over-year growth. Microbial Control and Grain Processing were also impacted by continued pre-COVID cycling, which impacted H&B's overall growth by approximately 5 percentage points. We are pleased to say that over the course of the first quarter, these businesses showed improvement and were positive in April as we cycle the comparable. We are encouraged by the tremendous performance of Home & Personal Care, which is a testament to evolving consumer trends that prioritize individual health more than ever before.
Turning now to Slide 14 to discuss the results of our Scent division. Overall, we are very pleased with Scent's strong performance, which has been a significant contributor to our company-wide growth. Our Scent division generated $569 million in total sales, representing 5% combined currency neutral growth against a strong 7% growth in the year-ago period as well. On a 2-year basis, growth is exceptional at approximately 6%.
Adjusted operating EBITDA improved 8%, with a 70 basis point margin expansion, predominantly driven by volume growth across the entire segment as well as favorable mix from Fine Fragrance recovery and continued productivity. As we began to see last quarter, our Fine Fragrance business experienced a solid recovery as away-from-home restrictions continue to lift and consumer behavior returned to more traditional levels. Coupled with this rebound, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and mid-teens growth in Cosmetic Actives resulted in another quarter of strong performance for the entire division, driven by volume recovery and new business wins across the segment. Our new call lists are also providing strong contributions with all 3 customers growing double digits in the first quarter.
Now on Slide 15, I would like to discuss the results of Pharma Solutions, our fourth division. As previously mentioned, Pharma Solutions had an impressive quarter of broad-based growth and made a solid contribution to IFF's overall higher Q1 sales. Pharma Solutions delivered $162 million in net sales, representing 3% in combined currency neutral growth, while adjusted operating EBITDA grew 2%. Taken in the context of the 11% growth in the prior year period, growth is impressive on a 2-year basis, average basis, at approximately 7%.
Looking at Pharma Solutions performance by business. Core Pharma and Industrial Pharma led the division with volume growth for METHOCEL, seaweeds and coatings, providing -- proving instrumental to Core Pharma and Global Specialty Solutions and Nitrocellulose supporting the success of industrial pharma. While we're very pleased with Pharma Solutions sales performance in the first quarter, we saw adjusted EBITDA margin decline due to higher cost of goods related factors. More specifically, gross margin was hurt by higher raw material and logistics costs related to supply chain challenges and force majeures due to the bad weather in the Midwest earlier this year. We had 2 plants shut down temporarily, which impacted raw material availability and caused higher distribution costs.
Now turning to Slide 16. I'd like to review our cash flow dynamics and capital allocation, which remain a top priority. As you will see, our operating cash flow was very strong at $358 million. We are quite pleased with Q1 cash generation. For legacy IFF, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. We typically have net working capital headwinds as we reset off Q4's goals and we make annual bonus payments in March. And this year, we also had large deal-related costs, such as cost to achieve investment banking fees, consulting expenses, et cetera.
A large part of our Q1 success came from core working capital, where we generated $193 million, a great job by our global team and a great outcome, but we don't expect this quarter after quarter as we'd like to build inventory up in some of our legacy N&B business areas to support future growth. 
In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $93 million or 3.5% of sales, up from last Q1's combined comparative $76 million or 2.6% of sales. Free cash flow generation was therefore a strong $265 million, and we distributed $82 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our leverage, which is net debt divided by credit-adjusted EBITDA, ended at 4.3x, as Andreas noted, back on Slide 6. This is ahead of our expectation of 4.5x first quarter post-merger leverage.
Now to provide some full year context. Legacy IFF generated $520 million of free cash flow in 2020. And combined, we expect to generate $1 billion in 2021. In 2021, we will invest more in legacy N&B production capacity to meet expected strong future demand but will only be slightly above our original full year CapEx projection of approximately 4.5% of sales. The dividend payment this year will be at this quarter will be $197 million, reflecting a higher post-merger share count. And we remain on track to meet our long-term deleveraging target of 3x net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA in 24 to 36 months from deal close.
Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to provide an update on our full year 2021 consolidated financial outlook. But before doing so, I want to remind everyone that in mid-April, we provided sales and adjusted EBITDA metrics for each of IFF's 4 segments on a 2020 pro forma and combined basis and additional detail on a segment level via our Learning Labs series. We are now in the appendix of this presentation providing an additional look back at the combined company's historical quarterly results for 2020 as part of our commitment to transparency and helping our shareholders understand the new IFF.
On a combined basis, IFF generated $10.6 billion of revenue for the full year 2020, with currency neutral growth of approximately 2%. And our combined adjusted operating EBITDA margin for 2020 was approximately 22%. Please remember that combined includes 11 months of N&B and 12 months of IFF in 2020 and 2021.
In our fourth quarter conference call in February, we gave initial pro forma guidance, which assumed the full 12 months of IFF and N&B, in order to be directly comparable to our previously provided S-4. Moving forward, to be more aligned with actual results and reporting, we are transitioning to guiding on 11 months of N&B, which excludes January, and 12 months of IFF in the 2021 year, in light of the merger completing on Feb 1. Also, please note that in January 2021, N&B's actual sales were approximately $507 million and adjusted operating EBITDA was $107 million. 
Given our first quarter results, our April preliminary sales, our rest of year FX expectations, incremental pricing to recover costs and the fact that Q1 was our toughest comparative period quarter, we are forecasting stronger sales growth through the rest of 2021. We have, therefore, increased our sales expectation for 2021 to be approximately $11.25 billion in combined revenues or plus 6% growth with an approximately 23% adjusted operating EBITDA margin. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a rise in the cost of goods, driven by input costs, including raw materials and logistics. In terms of raw material costs, we are seeing a large increase in selected commodities, soy, low-cost bean kernel, vegetable oil, turpentine and propylene glycol. In addition, freight costs are higher as a result of greatly increased rates. For example, the global freight index is up 3x due to nonavailability of containers at contracted rates. And we're also seeing an uplift in airfreight volumes due to strong demand and supply chain challenges like force majeure earlier this year.
This has required us to go back to have additional pricing discussions to cover our exposure. While we are confident that over time, we can fully pass along the increase, there is a time lag before pricing is fully realized, which can pressure gross margin in the short term. Ultimately, by the end of the year, we are confident that through pricing and our ongoing focus on cost reduction, we can achieve our full year adjusted operating EBITDA goal on a combined basis.
With regard to Q2, we are pleased that we've started the quarter strong, a nice growth acceleration versus where we ended the first quarter. We're optimistic that for the full second quarter, revenue growth, including currency benefits, should be in the high single digits range with an adjusted EBITDA margin also around 23%.
To assist with understanding and modeling the new IFF, we are also sharing our expectations with regard to depreciation, amortization, interest expenses, CapEx, adjusted effective tax rate excluding amortization and our weighted average share count, all on a combined basis. While most of these metrics probably don't need to be elaborated upon, it's worth noting that we expect moderately higher CapEx in 2021 as we invest for growth and work to exit some of our IT-related transition services agreements with DuPont more quickly than planned. We're also providing a 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization, for the first time. And the 21.5% is broadly in line with our early expectations. This is still preliminary and will change as we finalize purchase accounting and intangibles by jurisdiction. The equivalent for heritage IFF on a similar basis for the full year 2020 was approximately 18.5%.
Collectively, these metrics and decisions reflect our confidence in IFF's ability to deliver solid results even in this volatile global environment. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to Andreas, who will provide some closing remarks."

I would like to wrap up today's call by first giving an enormous thank you to our thousands of employees around the world who have worked tirelessly over the last quarter to successfully execute our business initiatives, deliver for our customers and achieve solid top and bottom line business results, all while making exceptional strides integrating N&B into the IFF family. It has truly been a busy quarter. And we all have much to be proud of especially as this all was accomplished during a global pandemic.
Looking beyond our solid Q1 financial results, I want to reemphasize the important first step that we took in tightening our business and optimizing our portfolio strategy by agreeing to divest our fruit preparation business. By divesting this noncore business, IFF will be more efficient organization with a greater capacity to focus on growth and innovation across our key businesses, ultimately generating greater value for our shareholders.
As we enter Q2 together, we are confident that we have the right team and the right structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operational goals. As I mentioned, we are targeting strong year-over-year financial improvements with accelerated sales growth over the coming quarters, backed by our commitment to delivering industry-leading innovative products and services to our customers around the world. And as Rustom stated, we are pleased that we have started Q2 strong and are optimistic that our full second quarter sales growth should be in a high single-digit range.
I'm tremendously proud of all we have accomplished, and I firmly believe that the best is yet to come. We're taking each and every learning from the N&B integration process to create a stronger, more agile and diversified company that defines the future of our industry and showcase what it means to be a leading ingredients and solutions partner.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And that's driven us, as Rustom said, as well, with a good start into the second quarter, which was actually -- the first quarter was our toughest comparison. So that's the reason why we raised our sales expectations for the year. I think that's important.
So now coming to the different parts of the business, I would say, first of all, we see -- if you look at the Scent business unit, a real good recovery on Fine Fragrances, which is really fantastic, in the first quarter and also starting in the second quarter, which is good. We see still a great growth on Cosmetic Actives. So that's basically super important for us as well. And the Consumer Fragrances stay on an elevated level.
If you go to the Health & Bioscience business, here you see a couple of elements. You see that Health and the Cultures & Food Enzyme business should grow mid-single digits. And you will see a recovery of the Microbial Control business, which was very much hurt by the situation last year. So that's important as well.
And then on the Nourish side, very solid performance on Taste, particularly the legacy flavors doing very well. But on the new parts, Protein Solutions, via alternative proteins, are doing very well. And then you will see a turnaround in the Food Service as well as the countries and economies are opening up. And that's probably a general remark. We have seen good growth, as you have seen in the presentation, in most of the regions. But in Europe -- and Europe will turn around as soon as these economies are opening up after the pandemic as well. So I hope, Mike, that gives you a bit more color here."

Maybe you should put Kerry in the mix as well, in particular for Food Service and some of the ingredients. And then you have actually a very nice peer group together. So what we want to do on the midterm is actually what we are doing -- we have done completely our strategic assessment of all the categories where we believe that we have growth and margin potential. We certainly will emphasize in terms of our resources behind these categories. Some of these categories are just, for example, in health, like the probiotics business, for example, where we put good resources behind to make sure that we can outgrow the competition here. 
And I think if you look at the start into the year, it's 3% growth if you adjust for the days. And there was a very strong comparison of 7% in the last year. So we're actually quite happy with the start, and we have seen some of the portfolio pieces are performing very well, like the Flavors business is coming well. You see it in the -- everything which is plant-based and protein-related. And we see some, let's say, turnaround as well. And I mentioned before when Mike Sison asked, on the Microbial Control, which is coming back. We see the Food Service business are coming back. And these are all good signals that we are on a really solid track now to accelerate our growth. And that's the reason why we said we raised our expectation for the rest of the year."

Also, higher freight costs due to sharply increased rates plus higher air freight volume in specific areas where we have strong demand, coupled with inventory and supply chain challenges.
But in any case, to answer your last part of your question, we do now expect raw material and logistics inflation combined to be in the mid-single digits this year. And obviously, this requires us to go back to our customers."

So we are prioritizing our investment towards the highest return opportunities. And that means that we spend actually a fair amount of money on Health & Bioscience. I think that's very, very important. So the biotech area is one of the main investment areas, for example, Probiotics, Enzymes & Cultures, just to name one. 
And then we have certainly a centralized R&D approach. And we have probably at least half of it on the centralized R&D and the rest goes into application labs.

We formulate, allowing them to reduce cost. For example, we can use our modulation technology for that to reduce cost for sweeteners in their products. 
But also in terms of our new platforms, we have now really the leading biotech platform, and that gives us really endless opportunities to use their fermentation technology, reduce input cost and basically create some of the ingredient via biotech pathways.

Because as people have pointed out with that, when doing the modeling, I mean, we are talking about our EPS ex amort, EBITDA, all the rest of that, so that's really what we did. I mean if you look at 2020 to clarify, I mean, the adjusted P&L number that we had for the whole year was 17.5% and the P&L ex amort, 18.5%, right? And so the number this year, what we're going to at 21.5% is -- reflects simply roughly about 100 basis points simply for the difference between those 2. And then the rest of it is just the fact that N&B came with a higher tax profile, which we had communicated and expected."

And also the raw material cost increases we're talking about are going to increase the dollars on hand, right? I mean, DSO pretty stable through the rest of the year. And so we haven't specifically forecast core working capital. But basically, by the end of the year, I would think we'd expect it to go up a little bit. And that's all factored in.

We might see a bit of a normalization, but we still expect good growth and maybe single-digit growth in that very important category. 
Another, let's say, category where we have very strong comparables is probiotics. You might have seen this for a couple of months. It was for legacy N&B double-digit growth last year. So we will see a normalization here, but still growth in the mid-single-digit range going forward. So these are the 2 categories which I would call out.

We have seen, let's say, in Q1, for example, on the Health & Bioscience piece, really double-digit growth. And as soon as that normalizes, we will see good growth coming out of H&B as well because the underlying business is actually very good, and the demand is strong.
On the pricing side, it's basically a pass-through. As you were saying, it's easier to raise prices compared with some of the legacy F&F businesses. And so the time lag is not as long as it is for some of the F&F businesses. I hope that answers the question, the first part."

Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter financial results and outlook for 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.
I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we're making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in yesterday's press release.
Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website.
Please note that we'll be using combined historical results for the second quarter, defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 3 months of legacy N&B results. And for the first half 2021, defined as 6 months of legacy IFF, January to June, and 5 months of legacy N&B, February to June, in both the 2020 and '21 periods to allow comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.
With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have at the end.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas."

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our performance during the first half of 2021, followed by an update regarding our ongoing efforts to fully integrate the N&B business following the completion of the transaction in the first quarter of the year. Rustom will then provide a detailed review of our second quarter financials, highlighting segment level business performance and the market dynamics we saw in the quarter. Before we jump into the question-and-answer session, Rustom will also conclude with an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2021.
Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our business highlights for the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that IFF has delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, which is a robust acceleration versus our combined Q1 growth and through the first half of the year.
As I've said before, execution is everything, and IFS has delivered strong financial results, while advancing our ongoing integration efforts following the completion of the N&B merger in February. In the first half of 2021, IFF achieved $5.6 billion in sales, representing 8% growth or 5% on a currency-neutral base. For comparable purposes and to reflect the portfolio differences between our peers, I want also to highlight that both businesses performed well, with legacy IFF achieving a very strong high single-digit growth rate with nearly 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and legacy N&B growing in mid-single digits.
At the same time, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, with significant headwinds in material cost and supply chain logistics. In the first half, combined EBITDA growth was a solid 6% and a combined EBITDA margin of 22.5%. Importantly, our strong free cash flow of $533 million enables IFF to maintain significant financial flexibility, including our efforts to delever. We remain on track to achieve our deleveraging targets of under 3x by year 3 post transaction close, and we improved our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA leverage from 4.3x in the first quarter to 4.2x in the second quarter. Finally, we are also well on track with integrating the N&B business and continue to realize synergies in line with our expectation for the transaction.
As we sharpen the IFF portfolio, we continue to progress on the divestiture of our food preparation business, which we expect to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the divestiture of this non-core business will create a more efficient IFF, with an enhanced ability to grow and innovate across the key business segments. We are committed to ongoing active portfolio management and will continue to seek ways to increase value creation.
Stepping back to reflect on the first half of the year. I'm very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish. We delivered strong sales growth, which is an acceleration versus historical performance for both legacy IFF and legacy N&B, in the midst of a transformational integration as well as a global pandemic. This is a validation of our strategy, motivates our team to continue defining industry expectations as we continue to see the benefits of our expanded product offering and capabilities.
Long-term growth prospects of our business are strong, and we are making investments in capacity, R&D and plant technologies as well as increasing inventory levels and incurring higher logistic costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim, specifically in the N&B business as we maximize our growth opportunities going forward.
As we look to the third quarter and second half of 2021, our objectives are clear: build on this momentum, while executing on our integration plans, allowing IFF to fully leverage our new capabilities and achieve our long-term expectations.
Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that influenced our results for the first half. Despite persisting global challenges and various economic recoveries, we are pleased to report growth in each of our 4 key operating regions. In North America, we achieved growth in all of our business segments, led by a single-digit growth in Scent, Nourish and H&B.
Similar to the first quarter, our Asian markets continue to perform well, achieving a 5% increase in sales led by double-digit growth in India and a mid-single-digit performance in China. While we had anticipated that growth would have been impacted in India due to COVID in the second quarter, the business was resilient and finished higher than we expected, with strong double-digit growth in Q2. 
From a segment perspective, in Asia, strong increases across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses all contributed to this sustained growth in this key region. Latin America, our strongest performing region, we achieved 12% sales growth, driven by double-digit performance in nearly all of IFF's business segments and underpinned by favorable currency movements and the impact in Brazil, Mexico and South Cone all achieved growth in the first half. 
We are particularly pleased to report that our EMEA region has impressively rebounded in the second quarter up to high single digits. We achieved a 2% increase in sales in the first half as COVID-19-related restrictions eased. Our Scent and Nourish business performed particularly well in Q2, both achieving double-digit growth. Bearing any newly emerging COVID-19 challenges, we expect this growth to continue through the remainder of the year as global vaccination rates increase, and Western and Central Europe continue to recover.
Now turning to Slide 8. I will provide a more detailed look at our sales performance across IFF's key business segments through the first half of 2021, particularly those that significantly contribute to our overall 8% sales growth or 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis that I mentioned earlier.
We are pleased to report solid growth across all of our 4 core divisions. Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Nourish achieved currency-neutral growth of 6%, driven by a strong performance in flavors, ingredients and food design.
Similar to the first quarter, Scent remains our largest sales driver on a year-to-date basis, achieving 8% in currency-neutral growth led by a strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance.
Our Health & Biosciences business has returned to solid growth in the second quarter following a challenging first quarter, where sales were affected by COVID-19 pressures in microbial control and grain processing. While microbial control continues to be challenged, for the first half, we saw growth in grain processing, which showed a recovery in the second quarter as well as home and personal care cultures and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Finally, our Pharma Solutions business also delivered growth to the first half of 2021 against a strong year ago comparison.
On Slide 9, I would like to discuss the underlying dynamics influencing each of our 4 segments in the first half. As I mentioned, we saw broad-based growth in all Nourish categories, led by robust performance in flavors. Despite strong volume and continued cost discipline, higher raw material costs continue to affect margin when compared to the first half of 2020. However, on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA grew about 7%. 
Our Health & Biosciences businesses delivered growth in the first half, led by strong performance in Home & Personal Care and grain processing. This growth offsets COVID-19-related pressures in microbial control and a strong year ago comparable in health. Higher logistic costs related to capacity and strong demand impacted our margin. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by this performance and expect continued improvement as we move into Q3.
Our leading growth and profitability driver, Scent, achieved an operating EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points and absolute EBITDA grew nearly 20%. This was driven by a strong rebound in Fine Fragrances as retail channels continue to recover, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and double-digit growth in Cosmetic Active. Scent also delivered strong profitability led by higher volumes, favorable mix and higher productivity, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year.
Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, the segment's 1% growth was driven primarily by improvements in industrials. So our margin was significantly challenged due to higher energy costs, lower manufacturing utilization and result in a weather-related raw material shortages. 
Now on Slide 10 and 11, I would like to discuss our continued synergy progress in connection with our merger with N&B. From a revenue synergy perspective, we remain on track to meet our $20 million revenue synergy target this year. Coupled with continued demand and positive feedback from our customers, we are also confident in our ability to meet our 2024 run rate revenue synergy target of approximately $400 million.
I would like to spend a moment highlighting how we realized this significant opportunity and share additional context on some of our recent wins. And only 6 months since completing the merger, we are already seeing strong affirmation in the opportunity before us. Our Home Care segment is a perfect example of how our expanded portfolio and combined capabilities with N&B delivers creative solutions for our customers and creates new opportunities for our business. 
Recently, our Health & Biosciences division saw an opportunity to collaborate with our Scent division, a global Scent customers expressed a need for enzyme technology and IFS capabilities across divisions allowed us to deliver an integrated solution and ultimately create a superior dishwashing detergent. 
Together with IFF's leading fragrance capabilities, our enzyme technology ensures fit-for-purpose delivery and performance, which creates a differentiated product for our customers. This opportunity represents more than $5 million in annual sales potential.
At the same time, we're actively working with other customers across our IFF network to develop solutions that require capabilities across our 4 divisions.  The food and beverage category, we continue to see demand for plant-based meat alternatives that showcase the best of our expanded portfolio.
For low sugar, low Fed yogurt, we are introducing new flavor technologies with improved texture and speed to market, which are key advantages for our customers. Lastly, in our health category, we are developing an integrated solution for fiber gummy that leverages our unmatched scientific and technical expertise, combined with our best-in-class flavor offering.
These are just a few examples of the cross-selling opportunities that we are seeing customers increasingly demand and differentiator for our business over the long term.
We made significant strides in the second quarter from an integration perspective, ramping up our cost synergies from a few million dollars in the first quarter to a total of approximately $15 million on a first half basis. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings program we have implemented in the second quarter, which allowed us to leverage our increased scale to reduce our indirect spend, benefit from various office consolidations and renegotiations and rightsize our organization.
Additionally, because of our operational strength and commitment to the integration process early on, we were all able to accelerate exiting our various transition service agreements with DuPont. I'm very encouraged by the continued progress on this front, and we are on track to deliver at least $45 million cost synergies for the full year and ultimately, our 3-year run rate cost synergy target of $300 million.
And now I will hand it over to Rustom."

I will begin with an overview of our consolidated second quarter results on Slide 12. 
In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on combined currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and a strong Health & Biosciences performance.
Though our gross margin was pressured by higher input costs, raw materials and logistics inflation, and higher air freight volumes, this was partly offset by our disciplined cost management practices, administrative expense reductions and cost synergies. This enabled us to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.50 for the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, I want to provide a perspective on sales performance in Q2 versus pre-COVID. There is no doubt that 2020 was an extraordinary year due to COVID-19, so it makes more sense to also evaluate our performance relative to 2019 levels. And as you can see, all 4 divisions in the second quarter delivered strong sales growth as compared to the space period.
Total company sales were up 8% on a 2-year basis, with double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma Solutions, a high single-digit increase in Scent and mid-single-digit growth in H&B. With the exception of a handful, all of our subcategories have grown relative to their pre-COVID levels. 
Most notably, we are pleased to report that those categories most impacted by COVID-19 are ahead of their respective Q2 2019 levels, including Cosmetic active, which is up double digits; Fine Fragrance, which is up high single digits; and Grain Processing, which is up low single digits.
Foodservice and microbial control, while we had strong growth in the second quarter of 2021, remain below Q2 2019 levels, but we expect will continue to improve as we move forward. This performance underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio as well as our position as an essential partner to our customers.
Now on the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the second quarter financials of each of our 4 divisions. Beginning with Nourish on Slide 14. Sales for the division increased by 15% year-over-year or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors, with Frutarom contributing to growth, and a strong ingredients performance, particularly from our protein solutions, cellulosic, locus bean gum and food protection categories. 
Nourish also saw a strong rebound in food design, including a very strong 24% growth in foodservice as pandemic-related restrictions continue to ease and consumer behavior in away-from-home channels continue to normalize. As I mentioned in the previous slide, higher raw material costs put relatively modest pressure on the margins of most of our individual segments, although we are pleased to have delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. Pricing continued to accelerate in Q2 and contributed over a percent of growth in the second quarter. As we will discuss later, we expect this will increase significantly in the third and fourth quarter as more of our pricing actions take hold.
Turning to Slide 15. Our Health & Biosciences division saw a year-over-year growth of 9% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home and Personal Care. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are particularly encouraged by Health & Biosciences return to growth this quarter, led by our microbial control and grain processing categories, strong recoveries and from the industrial and supply chain challenges related to COVID-19.
Performance in our health category was challenged based on the particularly strong bit probiotics year-over-year comparison, although this did not offset the rest of the segment's growth and we remain confident in the health categories trajectory moving forward.
Health & Biosciences also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5%. While you see that the division's margin was down this quarter, this was due to higher logistics costs in order to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and invest in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year. We are incurring significantly higher airfreight costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim and this is impacting our EBITDA margin.
Now turning to Slide 16 to discuss the results of our Scent division, which continued to be a standout growth contributor this quarter. Our Scent division generated $550 million in total sales, representing year-over-year growth of 16% or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Scent also achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 34% with margin expansion of 300 basis points, driven by robust volume mix and productivity, which did offset some inflationary pressures.
While Consumer Fragrances was down slightly this quarter against a very strong double-digit year-ago comparison, a significant rebound in Fine Fragrances, which grew by approximately 85%, led by new wins and improved volumes more than offset Consumer Fragrances more modest performance due to last year's double-digit growth.
Our ingredients category also contributed to the division's strong performance, growing double digits, led by strong performance in Cosmetic active and Fragrance Ingredients. Overall, we are extremely pleased with Scent's continued strong performance.
Lastly, turning to Slide 17 to discuss Pharma Solutions. Currency-neutral sales were flat against a strong year ago comparison, with industrial Pharma the most significant performance driver for this division, led by Global Specialty Solutions. Core Pharma's performance was challenged against a very strong year ago comparison.
On a 2-year basis, growth was solid at about 3.5%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was pressured this quarter, with the margin decline due to higher energy costs and lower manufacturing utilization due to a couple of plant shutdowns as a result of weather-related raw material shortages. Specifically, we had raw material availability issues related to the Midwest storm in the U.S. earlier this year, which meant we were not able to run production and absorb our fixed costs. Going forward, the supply chain is improving which we expect will lead to stronger margins in Pharma Solutions for the balance of the year.
Now turning to Slide 18. I'd like to review our cash flow position, leverage dynamics for the first half of 2021, which remain a top priority as we continue to navigate a recovering global market.
As you will see in the first half, IFF generated $533 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow from operations totaling $698 million, driven by an improvement in core working capital. CapEx for the first half totaled $165 million or approximately 3% of sales as we continue to invest in growth accretive areas that we believe will ultimately prove rewarding over the long term as well as integration-related activities.
In the first half, we also delivered $274 million in dividends to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we are confident that our cash generation will remain robust, and have announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
From a leverage perspective, our cash and cash equivalents finished at $935 million, with gross debt holding steady at $12 billion. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.61 billion, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x.
We are slightly better than we expect to be at this point in time, and we are still expecting to delever to below 3x net debt to EBITDA in the first 3 years post the transaction close.
Now moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2021. IFF has built a solid foundation in the first half of the year. and delivered particularly strong second quarter performance, and we expect strong growth will continue through the rest of the year.
For the full year 2021, we are, once again, increasing our forecast for total revenues with an expectation to achieve 2021 total revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, which equates to about 7% growth. This is up from our previous $11.25 billion or 6% growth as we have confidence in our sales momentum continuing into Q3 and through the rest of the year. Breaking down the contributors of growth, we expect currency-neutral sales to be about 5% and FX benefits to be approximately 2%. 
While pandemic-related uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the strong performance and important recoveries we are seeing across the business. which we believe position us well to capture continued strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4. At the same time, we now see full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin at about 22.5% versus approximately 23% previously. A part of this reduction is related to our margin performance in Q2 for all the reasons I explained earlier. We also continue to see inflationary pressures across the supply chain.
From a raw material perspective, we have seen raw material costs continue to increase over the course of the year. In the first half, we are successful in raising our prices to recover a portion of the cost increases and continue to expect close to full cost recovery in the second half.
It should be noted that we're also seeing more broad-based non-raw material inflation, such as higher energy costs that we are managing through. Our expectations for airfreight has also increased significantly as rates are higher, but mostly higher volumes to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We are absorbing higher logistics costs to grow the business in the short term and expect this is only temporary until our capacity expansion projects are complete.
The combination of unfavorable price to raw material costs and higher logistics costs are negatively impacting operating margin in 2021 by more than 100 basis points. However, through higher sales, strong cost discipline and our focus on unlocking additional cost synergies, we believe we will end up only about 50 basis points lower than our previous expectations, with higher revenues and a roughly similar dollar EBITDA leve.
For modeling purposes, please note that depreciation and amortization, interest expense, CapEx as a percentage of sales, adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization and weighted average diluted share counts all remain the same as what we shared in Q1.
Overall, we are confident that we are well placed to continue capturing additional growth over the next 2 quarters and beyond, while maintaining our focus on execution, continued financial discipline and leveraging our significantly bolstered resources and expertise as a stronger, more diversified company.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Andreas, who will provide some closing remarks before we open the line for our question-and-answer session."

Before I wrap up today's call, I would like to first recognize our thousands of employees around the world who continue to display their unwavering commitment to serve our customers, unify our teams together with N&B and deliver for our communities. Despite the uncertain environment that we have continued to navigate, IFF's first half and Q2 results showcased the strength of our combined portfolio and our ability to execute our ambitious business objectives. And I'm incredibly proud to lead such a talented and passionate group of IFFers.
We have much to be proud of this quarter as we move ahead. I'm confident that we have built the financial and operational structures needed for our combined company to reach even greater heights. As Rustom and I have mentioned, we are targeting a strong full year performance, indicative of our post-pandemic aspirations, and I know we are exceptionally positioned to achieve this. And we are seeing the strong top line momentum continue in the early days of the third quarter.
Together, we will further our mission to be an innovative force for good and redefine what it means to be a leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And then related to that, was there any borrowing in 2Q from the back half of the year? Is that something that we should listen for watch for kind of thing? And how do you think about that?

It's a very robust demand we are seeing. In some areas, it is also a superior technology, in particular in parts of the enzyme business and a really good R&D pipeline here as well.
So the question now is why we are not going higher? Look, it's a environment for us right now. and as for everybody else. So we have now the COVID Delta variant.

Getting -- you're going after pricing aggressively to recover that, how do we think about that impacting some of the -- or the trajectory impacting the medium term targets around revenue growth, around EBITDA margins by 2023? Did it have any impact in terms of the timing of synergy capture over the next 12 to 24 months? Because I know procurement was a big part, a big bucket in terms of the targeted cost synergies.

And I have to say that was a big focus for our team right now to look because we didn't get the procurement savings in the second quarter we wanted, and probably not in the third. So we shifted actually pretty agile, the way how we deliver the synergies. So it was more cost out in particular in terms of headcount in other areas as well.
And we are now planning for next year getting more of the synergies from procurement and then certainly in 2023 because, at some point in time, it will ease. So we -- I think we did a good job just, let's say, shift where we get it from.
On the revenue growth, before I hand it over to Rustom on EBITDA, it is certainly positive because you will see also a carryover effect into next year on the sales line if you have raised the prices, which is good and good to see for us. But I guess everybody in that marketplace is doing it right now.
But Rustom, if you can talk about the cost pressures, in general? How you see it and the EBITDA margin."

I was curious to the degree as you've now gotten further in with the N&B business, if it feels like perhaps that's been a bit underinvested in -- whether it was in the 12 to 15 months prior to deal close or even before that because the need to be investing in CapEx, the call out of higher-than-expected logistics separate from rate, right, but just again, because of these capacity air freight and so on suggests that there's something there.

And we have now adapted our CapEx plan going forward that we can deal with these, let's say, shortages quite nicely over the next, I would say, 15 months. The positive for me is that demand is very robust. And the other positive is that we see some superiority of our products in that market, which is really good.

Consumer Fragrance, here, I would say, in general, for the market, you see a moderation, and that's what you hear in the market from the big CPGs as well. But again, we are in the good position or lucky position that we are on all the core lists we wanted to be.
And then we talked over the last couple of quarters about the callers we made 1.5 years ago, and they are really contributing. So that's helpful for us. But in general, we see some moderation. Another one is active cosmetics. We see a big, big and strong growth going forward. On Health & Bioscience, I would say, very strong in Home and Personal Care, but more driven by our wins and our technology than by the whole market. So that's what I would say. And then grain processing and microbial control are coming back out of let's say, modest performance in last year. And animal nutrition is pretty good, good as well.
On the Nourish side, I would say we haven't seen any slowing down of demand. And that might be also driven because we are now in a unique position that we can offer, from the ingredient, to the flavor, to the total solution that we are in a different position than many of our competitors, and that helps us actually to position us in the right way.
So answering your question is we see some markets, we see the market's moderation, but not too much for us because of the position where we're in right now. So that will be my overall comment."

I mean, yes, it came from the February outages, but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, right, with methachloride. And it shut down 2 of our plants temporarily during the period, which meant that it's a pity because we could have sold every single thing we produced, obviously, -- And then we also had underutilization. So that's what came through there. If I was to roughly look at the break in general, at the percentages in general between raw material and freight about, call it, 85% or so of the total comes from raw material increases and about 15% from freight. 
And that's -- but -- But interestingly, freight is a much smaller portion, right? If you break up that 5.5% that we talked about, the material cost impact is probably about 5% inflation we're seeing. I'm rounding all these numbers. And the freight rate increase is probably about 8%. And may even be slightly higher with the way that's going. I mean containers are 3 to 4x sea freight as high as they've been. And also, there's one more complication even when we have contracted rates we and many others experienced, there's lots of delays going on and stuff. So we sometimes book -- we can't get the stuff on the contracted rate still much later and have to pick spot rates. And we also forced sometimes to look at different modes of transport from a reliability perspective. So lot's going on there."

The second one, early in the presentation, you mentioned that in the second half, you may see a fairly similar contribution from pricing, about 2.5% and 2.5% from volumes. And I'm just trying to understand why you're being so cautious on the volume side? Or maybe I just misunderstood this."

And so what we've -- our guidance, Lisa, in the second half is sort of we're trying to guide to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing again. So that's really what you're seeing over there. And on the first part of your question, I mean, yes, for the Scent business, the margin expansion was really driven by the mix for sure. I mean, for sure. I mean when you have Fine Fragrances going up 85%, that's tremendous, right? 
So it was mixed, but there's also volume growth, in general. I mean you've seen Cosmetic Active was super as well and then productivity. And that offset inflationary pressures and costs which you're seeing there as well. And in the second half, we'll see more costs coming the way of the Scent business, not on the scale of nourishing what we've seen. Anything to add there, Andreas?"

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. 
Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter financial results and outlook for 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.
I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we're making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in yesterday's press release.
Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website.
Please note that we'll be using combined historical results for the second quarter, defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 3 months of legacy N&B results. And for the first half 2021, defined as 6 months of legacy IFF, January to June, and 5 months of legacy N&B, February to June, in both the 2020 and '21 periods to allow comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.
With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have at the end.
I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas."

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our performance during the first half of 2021, followed by an update regarding our ongoing efforts to fully integrate the N&B business following the completion of the transaction in the first quarter of the year. Rustom will then provide a detailed review of our second quarter financials, highlighting segment level business performance and the market dynamics we saw in the quarter. Before we jump into the question-and-answer session, Rustom will also conclude with an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2021.
Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our business highlights for the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that IFF has delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, which is a robust acceleration versus our combined Q1 growth and through the first half of the year.
As I've said before, execution is everything, and IFF has delivered strong financial results, while advancing our ongoing integration efforts following the completion of the N&B merger in February. In the first half of 2021, IFF achieved $5.6 billion in sales, representing 8% growth or 5% on a currency-neutral base. For comparable purposes and to reflect the portfolio differences between our peers, I want also to highlight that both businesses performed well, with legacy IFF achieving a very strong high single-digit growth rate with nearly 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and legacy N&B growing in mid-single digits.
At the same time, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, with significant headwinds in material cost and supply chain logistics. In the first half, combined EBITDA growth was a solid 6% and a combined EBITDA margin of 22.5%. 
Importantly, our strong free cash flow of $533 million enables IFF to maintain significant financial flexibility, including our efforts to delever. We remain on track to achieve our deleveraging targets of under 3x by year 3 post transaction close, and we improved our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA leverage from 4.3x in the first quarter to 4.2x in the second quarter. Finally, we are also well on track with integrating the N&B business and continue to realize synergies in line with our expectation for the transaction.
As we sharpen the IFF portfolio, we continue to progress on the divestiture of our food preparation business, which we expect to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the divestiture of this non-core business will create a more efficient IFF, with an enhanced ability to grow and innovate across the key business segments. We are committed to ongoing active portfolio management and will continue to seek ways to increase value creation.
Stepping back to reflect on the first half of the year. I'm very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish. We delivered strong sales growth, which is an acceleration versus historical performance for both legacy IFF and legacy N&B, in the midst of a transformational integration as well as a global pandemic. This is a validation of our strategy, motivates our team to continue defining industry expectations as we continue to see the benefits of our expanded product offering and capabilities.
Long-term growth prospects of our business are strong, and we are making investments in capacity, R&D and plant technologies as well as increasing inventory levels and incurring higher logistic costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim, specifically in the N&B business as we maximize our growth opportunities going forward.
As we look to the third quarter and second half of 2021, our objectives are clear: build on this momentum, while executing on our integration plans, allowing IFF to fully leverage our new capabilities and achieve our long-term expectations.
Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that influenced our results for the first half. Despite persisting global challenges and various economic recoveries, we are pleased to report growth in each of our 4 key operating regions. In North America, we achieved growth in all of our business segments, led by a single-digit growth in Scent, Nourish and H&B.
Similar to the first quarter, our Asian markets continue to perform well, achieving a 5% increase in sales led by double-digit growth in India and a mid-single-digit performance in China. While we had anticipated that growth would have been impacted in India due to COVID in the second quarter, the business was resilient and finished higher than we expected, with strong double-digit growth in Q2. 
From a segment perspective, in Asia, strong increases across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses all contributed to this sustained growth in this key region. Latin America, our strongest performing region, we achieved 12% sales growth, driven by double-digit performance in nearly all of IFF's business segments and underpinned by favorable currency movements and the impact in Brazil, Mexico and South Cone all achieved growth in the first half. 
We are particularly pleased to report that our EMEA region has impressively rebounded in the second quarter up to high single digits. We achieved a 2% increase in sales in the first half as COVID-19-related restrictions eased. Our Scent and Nourish business performed particularly well in Q2, both achieving double-digit growth. 
Bearing any newly emerging COVID-19 challenges, we expect this growth to continue through the remainder of the year as global vaccination rates increase, and Western and Central Europe continue to recover.
Now turning to Slide 8. I will provide a more detailed look at our sales performance across IFF's key business segments through the first half of 2021, particularly those that significantly contribute to our overall 8% sales growth or 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis that I mentioned earlier.
We are pleased to report solid growth across all of our 4 core divisions. Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Nourish achieved currency-neutral growth of 6%, driven by a strong performance in flavors, ingredients and food design.
Similar to the first quarter, Scent remains our largest sales driver on a year-to-date basis, achieving 8% in currency-neutral growth led by a strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance.
Our Health & Biosciences business has returned to solid growth in the second quarter following a challenging first quarter, where sales were affected by COVID-19 pressures in Microbial Control and Grain Processing. While Microbial Control continues to be challenged, for the first half, we saw growth in Grain Processing, which showed a recovery in the second quarter as well as Home & Personal Care cultures and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Finally, our Pharma Solutions business also delivered growth to the first half of 2021 against a strong year ago comparison.
On Slide 9, I would like to discuss the underlying dynamics influencing each of our 4 segments in the first half. As I mentioned, we saw broad-based growth in all Nourish categories, led by robust performance in flavors. Despite strong volume and continued cost discipline, higher raw material costs continue to affect margin when compared to the first half of 2020. However, on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA grew about 7%. 
Our Health & Biosciences businesses delivered growth in the first half, led by strong performance in Home & Personal Care and Grain Processing. This growth offsets COVID-19-related pressures in Microbial Control and a strong year ago comparable in health. Higher logistic costs related to capacity and strong demand impacted our margin. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by this performance and expect continued improvement as we move into Q3.
Our leading growth and profitability driver, Scent, achieved an operating EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points and absolute EBITDA grew nearly 20%. This was driven by a strong rebound in Fine Fragrances as retail channels continue to recover, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and double-digit growth in Cosmetic Active. Scent also delivered strong profitability led by higher volumes, favorable mix and higher productivity, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year.
Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, the segment's 1% growth was driven primarily by improvements in industrials. So our margin was significantly challenged due to higher energy costs, lower manufacturing utilization and result in a weather-related raw material shortages. 
Now on Slide 10 and 11, I would like to discuss our continued synergy progress in connection with our merger with N&B. From a revenue synergy perspective, we remain on track to meet our $20 million revenue synergy target this year. Coupled with continued demand and positive feedback from our customers, we are also confident in our ability to meet our 2024 run rate revenue synergy target of approximately $400 million.
I would like to spend a moment highlighting how we realized this significant opportunity and share additional context on some of our recent wins. And only 6 months since completing the merger, we are already seeing strong affirmation in the opportunity before us. Our Home Care segment is a perfect example of how our expanded portfolio and combined capabilities with N&B delivers creative solutions for our customers and creates new opportunities for our business. 
Recently, our Health & Biosciences division saw an opportunity to collaborate with our Scent division, a global Scent's customers expressed a need for enzyme technology and IFF's capabilities across divisions allowed us to deliver an integrated solution and ultimately create a superior dishwashing detergent. 
Together with IFF's leading fragrance capabilities, our enzyme technology ensures fit-for-purpose delivery and performance, which creates a differentiated product for our customers. This opportunity represents more than $5 million in annual sales potential.
At the same time, we're actively working with other customers across our IFF network to develop solutions that require capabilities across our 4 divisions. The food and beverage category, we continue to see demand for plant-based meat alternatives that showcase the best of our expanded portfolio.
For low sugar, low fed yogurt, we are introducing new flavor technologies with improved texture and speed to market, which are key advantages for our customers. Lastly, in our health category, we are developing an integrated solution for fiber gummy that leverages our unmatched scientific and technical expertise, combined with our best-in-class flavor offering.
These are just a few examples of the cross-selling opportunities that we are seeing customers increasingly demand and differentiator for our business over the long term.
We made significant strides in the second quarter from an integration perspective, ramping up our cost synergies from a few million dollars in the first quarter to a total of approximately $15 million on a first half basis. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings program we have implemented in the second quarter, which allowed us to leverage our increased scale to reduce our indirect spend, benefit from various office consolidations and renegotiations and rightsize our organization.
Additionally, because of our operational strength and commitment to the integration process early on, we were all able to accelerate exiting our various transition service agreements with DuPont. I'm very encouraged by the continued progress on this front, and we are on track to deliver at least $45 million cost synergies for the full year and ultimately, our 3-year run rate cost synergy target of $300 million.
And now I will hand it over to Rustom."

In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency-neutral basis, pr",1760,"Thank you, Andreas. I will begin with an overview of our consolidated second quarter results on Slide 12. 
In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and a strong Health & Biosciences performance.
Though our gross margin was pressured by higher input costs, raw materials and logistics inflation, and higher air freight volumes, this was partly offset by our disciplined cost management practices, administrative expense reductions and cost synergies. This enabled us to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.50 for the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, I want to provide a perspective on sales performance in Q2 versus pre-COVID. There is no doubt that 2020 was an extraordinary year due to COVID-19, so it makes more sense to also evaluate our performance relative to 2019 levels. And as you can see, all 4 divisions in the second quarter delivered strong sales growth as compared to the space period.
Total company sales were up 8% on a 2-year basis, with double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma Solutions, a high single-digit increase in Scent and mid-single-digit growth in H&B. With the exception of a handful, all of our subcategories have grown relative to their pre-COVID levels. 
Most notably, we are pleased to report that those categories most impacted by COVID-19 are ahead of their respective Q2 2019 levels, including Cosmetic Active, which is up double digits; Fine Fragrance, which is up high single digits; and Grain Processing, which is up low single digits.
Food Service and Microbial Control, while we had strong growth in the second quarter of 2021, remain below Q2 2019 levels, but we expect will continue to improve as we move forward. This performance underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio as well as our position as an essential partner to our customers.
Now on the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the second quarter financials of each of our 4 divisions. Beginning with Nourish on Slide 14. Sales for the division increased by 15% year-over-year or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors, with Frutarom contributing to growth, and a strong ingredients performance, particularly from our protein solutions, cellulosic, locus bean gum and food protection categories. 
Nourish also saw a strong rebound in Food Design, including a very strong 24% growth in Food Service as pandemic-related restrictions continue to ease and consumer behavior in away-from-home channels continue to normalize. As I mentioned in the previous slide, higher raw material costs put relatively modest pressure on the margins of most of our individual segments, although we are pleased to have delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. 
Pricing continued to accelerate in Q2 and contributed over a percent of growth in the second quarter. As we will discuss later, we expect this will increase significantly in the third and fourth quarter as more of our pricing actions take hold.
Turning to Slide 15. Our Health & Biosciences division saw a year-over-year growth of 9% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home and Personal Care. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are particularly encouraged by Health & Biosciences return to growth this quarter, led by our Microbial Control and Grain Processing categories strong recoveries from the industrial and supply chain challenges related to COVID-19.
Performance in our health category was challenged based on the particularly strong double digit probiotics year-over-year comparison, although this did not offset the rest of the segment's growth and we remain confident in the health categories trajectory moving forward.
Health & Biosciences also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5%. While you see that the division's margin was down this quarter, this was due to higher logistics costs in order to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and invest in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year. We are incurring significantly higher airfreight costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim and this is impacting our EBITDA margin.
Now turning to Slide 16 to discuss the results of our Scent division, which continued to be a standout growth contributor this quarter. Our Scent division generated $550 million in total sales, representing year-over-year growth of 16% or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Scent also achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 34% with margin expansion of 300 basis points, driven by robust volume mix and productivity, which did offset some inflationary pressures.
While Consumer Fragrances was down slightly this quarter against a very strong double-digit year-ago comparison, a significant rebound in Fine Fragrances, which grew by approximately 85%, led by new wins and improved volumes, more than offset Consumer Fragrances more modest performance due to last year's double-digit growth.
Our Ingredients category also contributed to the division's strong performance, growing double digits, led by strong performance in Cosmetic Active and Fragrance Ingredients. Overall, we are extremely pleased with Scent's continued strong performance.
Lastly, turning to Slide 17 to discuss Pharma Solutions. Currency-neutral sales were flat against a strong year ago comparison, with industrial Pharma the most significant performance driver for this division, led by Global Specialty Solutions. Core pharma's performance was challenged against a very strong year ago comparison.
On a 2-year basis, growth was solid at about 3.5%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was pressured this quarter, with the margin decline due to higher energy costs and lower manufacturing utilization due to a couple of plant shutdowns as a result of weather-related raw material shortages. Specifically, we had raw material availability issues related to the Midwest storm in the U.S. earlier this year, which meant we were not able to run production and absorb our fixed costs. Going forward, the supply chain is improving which we expect will lead to stronger margins in Pharma Solutions for the balance of the year.
Now turning to Slide 18. I'd like to review our cash flow position, leverage dynamics for the first half of 2021, which remain a top priority as we continue to navigate a recovering global market.
As you will see in the first half, IFF generated $533 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow from operations totaling $698 million, driven by an improvement in core working capital. CapEx for the first half totaled $165 million or approximately 3% of sales as we continue to invest in growth-accretive areas that we believe will ultimately prove rewarding over the long term as well as integration-related activities.
In the first half, we also delivered $274 million in dividends to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we are confident that our cash generation will remain robust, and have announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
From a leverage perspective, our cash and cash equivalents finished at $935 million, with gross debt holding steady at $12 billion. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.61 billion, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x.
We are slightly better than we expect to be at this point in time, and we are still expecting to delever to below 3x net debt to EBITDA in the first 3 years post the transaction close.
Now moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2021. IFF has built a solid foundation in the first half of the year and delivered particularly strong second quarter performance, and we expect strong growth will continue through the rest of the year.
For the full year 2021, we are, once again, increasing our forecast for total revenues with an expectation to achieve 2021 total revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, which equates to about 7% growth. This is up from our previous $11.25 billion or 6% growth as we have confidence in our sales momentum continuing into Q3 and through the rest of the year. Breaking down the contributors of growth, we expect currency-neutral sales to be about 5% and FX benefits to be approximately 2%. 
While pandemic-related uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the strong performance and important recoveries we are seeing across the business, which we believe position us well to capture continued strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4. At the same time, we now see full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin at about 22.5% versus approximately 23% previously. A part of this reduction is related to our margin performance in Q2 for all the reasons I explained earlier. We also continue to see inflationary pressures across the supply chain.
From a raw material perspective, we have seen raw material costs continue to increase over the course of the year. In the first half, we are successful in raising our prices to recover a portion of the cost increases and continue to expect close to full cost recovery in the second half.
It should be noted that we're also seeing more broad-based non-raw material inflation, such as higher energy costs that we are managing through. Our expectations for airfreight has also increased significantly as rates are higher, but mostly higher volumes to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We are absorbing higher logistics costs to grow the business in the short term and expect this is only temporary until our capacity expansion projects are complete.
The combination of unfavorable price to raw material costs and higher logistics costs are negatively impacting operating margin in 2021 by more than 100 basis points. However, through higher sales, strong cost discipline and our focus on unlocking additional cost synergies, we believe we will end up only about 50 basis points lower than our previous expectations, with higher revenues and a roughly similar dollar EBITDA level.
For modeling purposes, please note that depreciation and amortization, interest expense, CapEx as a percentage of sales, adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization and weighted average diluted share counts all remain the same as what we shared in Q1.
Overall, we are confident that we are well placed to continue capturing additional growth over the next 2 quarters and beyond, while maintaining our focus on execution, continued financial discipline and leveraging our significantly bolstered resources and expertise as a stronger, more diversified company.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Andreas, who will provide some closing remarks before we open the line for our question-and-answer session."

So I guess, why not raise more considering the strong second quarter result? Obviously, comparisons remain favorable over the back half of the year. Rustom talked about incremental pricing. So maybe if you could just talk about that generally? 
And then related to that, was there any borrowing in 2Q from the back half of the year? Is that something that we should listen for, watch for kind of thing? And how do you think about that? And then on pricing, how do you think about the increase in pricing, which seems to be much more around the DB portfolio and thinking about the elasticity there relative to the legacy business?"

So first of all, your second question, there's no borrowing from the third quarter for the second quarter. I think that's important. Number 2 is what is driving us and the strong performance in the second quarter and also the start into the third quarter because July, we had the sales already. So it's a strong win rate. It's a very robust demand we are seeing. In some areas, it is also a superior technology, in particular in parts of the enzyme business and a really good R&D pipeline here as well.
So the question now is why we are not going higher? Look, it's a [indiscernible] environment for us right now. and as for everybody else. So we have now the COVID Delta variant. And we said, ""Look, let's be careful here what we do getting ahead of our skis here and make sure that we have a very realistic target on the sales side."" And Rustom, if you could talk a bit about volume and pricing, that would be probably helpful."

So we've calibrated our guidance, we think appropriately, to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing. 
And the composition is a bit different of our first half and second half growth. I mean in the second half, we're expecting that, on average, pricing will contribute close to 2.5 points of growth, with volumes at a similar level. So this is all without FX, of course."

I'll give you a couple of examples. I did know since we are going a little bit lighter on the pandemic. I did a good trip in the U.S. and in Europe actually twice. And I saw what the power is combining, let's say, an ingredient sale with a flavor sale. So I'm really optimistic that we are, let's say, are moving in the right direction. But it's probably too early to raise the forecast already for next year. That might be in the next call where we can take a very detailed look.
The most important thing for me is how natural the teams are already combining ingredients at Flavors, for example, and what kind of opportunities we have in areas like the Home Care with superior edition washing detergents, for example, and in the health area as well, which were not so much on our forefront when we started this all endeavor.

No, actually, look, what we see is we are -- we'll recover in the second half in Pharma, because we are recovering some of it through all the cold snap we had in the Midwest. So that will come back, but probably not to the degree we have the demand.
And on the Health & Bioscience piece, it's certainly driven by our manufacturing capacity, which is limited but also with higher comps we will see for the last 2 quarters. So we will see how it goes. We are very careful here on this side. But it will be more positive than what we have seen in the first quarter. Certainly, we saw already an acceleration in the second quarter, and it will go in the right direction.
So we are observing it quite carefully. What I can tell you also in the third quarter, the legacy N&B businesses had a pretty strong start. And then certainly, part of it is in the Nourish business as well and reflected in the Nourish numbers, in particular, the Ingredients business, we should not underestimate that. 
Well, by the way, having you on, I hope you have seen the really strong performance of Fine Fragrances, which are really going in the right direction, helping with the mix on the Scent side quite significantly?"

I had one more question, though, on the capacity additions and that you're still going a little bit about so far.
I was curious to the degree as you've now gotten further in with the N&B business, if it feels like perhaps that's been a bit underinvested in -- whether it was in the 12 to 15 months prior to deal close or even before that because the need to be investing in CapEx, the call out of higher-than-expected logistics separate from rate, right, but just again, because of these capacity air freight and so on suggests that there's something there. 
So just curious about that. Is it -- are you yet to a point where this could be a multiyear period of investment in capacity, not just 1 year, you've got the cash flow, but just curious about that."

I would not say it was underinvested, but it was probably also through the pandemic, not on the real time horizon. We could have had some of the expansion already probably 6 months earlier than we would be in a better position. But it is as it is. 
And we have now adapted our CapEx plan going forward that we can deal with these, let's say, shortages quite nicely over the next, I would say, 15 months. The positive for me is that demand is very robust. And the other positive is that we see some superiority of our products in that market, which is really good. And there's something which we haven't talked too much because it might be more midterm, but the R&D pipeline, in particular, what comes from N&B is super strong, and it helps us with our wins going forward.

On -- I would say if I go to the different categories,  we see still strong demand for Fine Fragrances. And this is not just driven by the robust demand right now, but also by our win rate. We are winning more than our fair share, and that's very, very helpful. Consumer Fragrance, here, I would say, in general, for the market, you see a moderation, and that's what you hear in the market from the big CPGs as well. But again, we are in the good position or lucky position that we are on all the core lists we wanted to be.
And then we talked over the last couple of quarters about the street callers we made 1.5 years ago, and they are really contributing. So that's helpful for us. But in general, we see some moderations. 
Another one is Active Cosmetics. We see a big, big and strong growth going forward. On Health & Bioscience, I would say, very strong in Home & Personal Care, but more driven by our wins and our technology than by the whole market. So that's what I would say. And then Grain Processing and Microbial Control are coming back out of, let's say, modest performance in last year. And animal nutrition is pretty good as well.
On the Nourish side, I would say we haven't seen any slowing down of demand. And that might be also driven because we are now in a unique position that we can offer, from the ingredient, to the flavor, to the total solution that we are in a different position than many of our competitors, and that helps us actually to position us in the right way.
So answering your question is we see some markets, we see the market's moderation, but not too much for us because of the position where we're in right now. So that will be my overall comment."

On the other hand, if the close down comes, I would say that Consumer Fragrances, in particular, in terms of the health and the hygiene products, are going up. And as you said, on the health side as well because people are trying to fortify their food, trying to be healthy, getting more probiotics in.

Can you break that down a little bit between what would be raw material energy inflation type stuff that the whole industry would be experiencing? And maybe what percent of that 100 basis points is unique to IFF given air freighting capacity issues, outages, et cetera?"

I mean, yes, it came from the February outages, but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, right, with methochloride. And it shut down 2 of our plants temporarily during the period",256,"So let me do the first one. I mean, yes, it came from the February outages, but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, right, with methochloride. And it shut down 2 of our plants temporarily during the period, which meant that it's a pity because we could have sold every single thing we produced, obviously, -- And then we also had underutilization. So that's what came through there. If I was to roughly look at the break in general, at the percentages in general between raw material and freight about, call it, 85% or so of the total comes from raw material increases and about 15% from freight. 
And that's -- but interestingly, freight is a much smaller portion, right? If you break up that 5.5% that we talked about, the material cost impact is probably about 5% inflation we're seeing. I'm rounding all these numbers. And the freight rate increase is probably about 8%. And may even be slightly higher with the way that's going. I mean containers are 3 to 4x, sea freight, as high as they've been. 
And also, there's one more complication even when we have contracted rates we and many others experienced, there's lots of delays going on and stuff. So we sometimes book -- we can't get the stuff on the contracted rate still much later and have to pay spot rates. And we also forced sometimes to look at different modes of transport from a reliability perspective. So lot's going on there."

And how we expect this to trend in the second half given raw materials were kicking in a little bit more meaningfully. But at the same time, you did mention you were still going to see relatively good demand for Fine Fragrance? That's my first question.
The second one, early in the presentation, you mentioned that in the second half you may see a fairly similar contribution from pricing, about 2.5% and 2.5% from volumes. And I'm just trying to understand why you're being so cautious on the volume side? Or maybe I just misunderstood this."

And we did have strong -- very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume-driven.
And so what we've -- our guidance, Lisa, in the second half is sort of we're trying to guide to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing again. So that's really what you're seeing over there. 
And on the first part of your question, I mean, yes, for the Scent business, the margin expansion was really driven by the mix for sure. I mean, for sure. I mean when you have Fine Fragrances going up 85%, that's tremendous, right? So it was mixed, but there's also volume growth, in general. I mean you've seen Cosmetic Active was super as well. 
And then productivity and that offset inflationary pressures and costs which you're seeing there as well. And in the second half, we'll see more costs coming the way of the Scent business, not on the scale of nourishing what we've seen. Anything to add there, Andreas?"

Please also note that we will be using combined historical results for the third quarter, defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 3 months of N&B results and for 9 months year-to-date defined as 9 months of legacy IFF January to September and 8 months of N&B February to September, in both the 2020 and 2021 period to allow for comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021. 
With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our recently appointed Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then we'll take any questions that you may have at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas."

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone, and I thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our performance results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated colleagues around the world, who have continued to work tirelessly in a challenging environment to fuel the global consumer goods supply chain and meet our customers' needs. I can't thank each and every one of you enough for your hard work, dedication and focus. 
I also want to take a moment and welcome Glenn Richter, who is joining us on today's call for the first time. As you know, Glenn joined us a little over a month ago as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm sure you will all find that his experience aligns perfectly with our strategic goals, making him an incredible asset to our team. I also want to thank Rustom for his leadership and contributions during his time as IFF's CFO. Rustom played an important role in our combination with DuPont N&B. And for that, we are immensely grateful. He has been important in putting IFF in a strong position it is today. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors. 
On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of year-to-date performance, including the progress we have made so far on our integration. I will then turn it over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question-and-answer session, Glenn will also speak to our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Now as I mentioned, I'd like to kick us off on Slide 6 by discussing our financial highlights for the first 9 months of 2021. Throughout the third quarter, we remained laser focused on extending the momentum IFF established in the first half of 2021. In the first 9 months of 2021, IFF achieved $8.6 billion in sales, representing 10% growth or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, a strong reflection of the strength of our market-leading platform and the compelling position we have established with our customers as a combined company. We delivered a 22% adjusted operating EBITDA margin and a combined EBITDA growth of 5%. 
As we will discuss in more detail, we continue to confront meaningful inflationary pressure due to higher raw material, logistics and energy costs. We have maintained our robust cost discipline efforts and are entering the fourth quarter with continued financial strength, having achieved $884 million free cash flow or approximately 10% of our trailing 9 months sales, driven by strong cash generation. This cash generation has enabled us to stay on track to meeting our deleveraging target. 
Finally, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, continued refinement and optimization of our portfolio is a critical component of our ongoing integration efforts. I'm pleased to share that we have completed the divestiture of our food preparation business and are on track to complete the divestiture of our microbial control business in the second quarter of 2022. Together, these 2 important divestitures will create a more focused IFF, allowing us to hone in on the constraints of our core business segments and it creates a stronger, more focused business. 
We will continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio as we move forward with our integration, looking for opportunities to rapidly divesting other noncore businesses. We started this year with a simple commitment to focus on execution and deliver on the potential of the new IFF. I'm pleased to say that even in a very challenging global environment, our team has met our integration objectives, while delivering strong results with continued sales momentum and profit growth. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to walk you through some of the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the last 9 months. First, I'm excited to share that we continue to experience strong growth in all 4 of our key operating regions despite ongoing and unique market uncertainties that have persisted across each geography. In North America, we achieved 7% growth across all 4 of IFF's business divisions, led by high single-digit growth in Nourish and Scent. These 2 divisions have continued to perform exceptionally well, quarter after quarter. 
In Asia, we experienced a 7% increase in sales led by continued double-digit growth in India as well as a low single-digit growth in China, even amidst particularly strong recent market complexities in the region. Our business unit perspective, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions continued to carry the region's growth throughout the year-to-date. 
Latin America continues to be our strongest performing region and sales growth leader, having achieved 12% growth, largely fueled by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and continued local currency strength. 
First, most impressive is a 7% sales growth that our EMEA region achieved to date, which includes a robust double-digit increase in the third quarter and precious performance on our Scent and Nourish division growth, this encouraging rebound with Scent delivering double-digit growth led by our Fine Fragrance business and Nourish delivering high single-digit growth led by our Foodservice business. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, and we will stay diligent to ensure our business remains nimble, positioned to perform against any new supply chain challenges that may arise. 
Moving now to Slide 8, I'd like to take a closer look at our 9 months year-to-date sales performance across IFF's key business segments. Our largest division, Nourish, has been a strong performer throughout the year, achieving currency-neutral sales growth of 9% with broad-based strength from our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Scent has had a similar strong year delivering 8% in currency-neutral growth to date, led by impressive double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance as well as strong growth in Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients. 
Health & Bioscience has seen strong demand in key focus areas including Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Cultures & Food Enzymes. As you know, we are in the process of selling our Microbial Control unit, which has continued to experience headwinds through this year but has rebounded from COVID-impacted lows with growth in both Q2 and Q3. This divestiture should further enhance the performance of this important division. 
Pharma Solutions, despite significant challenges, is flat so far for the year. Supply chain challenges have had an outsized impact on this division throughout the year. While we have seen encouraging growth in our Industrial business, the division still struggles to meet customer demand due to raw material availability challenges and logistics issues. 
Now on Slide 9, you will see that we have outlined some of the factors influencing the growth and profitability of each of our 4 divisions so far this year. As I previously mentioned, Nourish has had a strong year with Flavors and Ingredients experiencing double-digit growth. We have been working hard in our execution to manage volume and cost to limit margin impact from higher raw material costs, which continued to be a headwind on our profitability. While we have seen some margin impact of about 20 basis points in the year, we are proud of how our execution has mitigated much of the negative headwinds, while delivering meaningful growth. Our team has did an exceptional job increasing prices to combat inflationary pressures something that will continue to be critical as we move forward. 
In Health & Bioscience, we mentioned broad-based growth across the markets, but here, we are seeing significant margin impacts from higher logistic costs. As shared on our second quarter call, part of this that freight rates have increased significantly, but also we are having higher logistic costs to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth, investing in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year and into 2022. 
The Scent division has certainly realized the strongest, all around bounce back as consumer demand rises across end markets. Notably, Fine Fragrances alone has realized 36% growth year-to-date with double-digit growth in Cosmetic Active and continued solid performance in Consumer Fragrances. At the time, sales profitability expansion of 110 basis points has been led by higher volume, favorable mix and higher productivity. 
As I mentioned, Pharma Solutions was the only division in which we did not experience sales growth due to continued global supply chain challenges that have impacted our ability to meet strong customer demand. These challenges, including supply and logistic constraints and ongoing inflation have, in turn, significantly pressured our margin compared to the first 9 months of 2020. 
Moving to the fourth quarter and entering 2022, we will be closely tracking supply chain dynamics, and we'll continue to prioritize returning our Pharma Solutions business to the profitability we know is achievable. And in the fourth quarter, we're expecting year-over-year top and bottom line performance to improve. 
As we have been talking about today, IFF is realizing very strong sales momentum across our business. This is a reflection of the powerful new position we have created through our combination with the N&B business and a compelling value proposition we can offer to our customers. While we are pleased to put many of the gross headwinds related to the pandemic behind us, it is important to understand that our growth this year is, in fact, meaningful above pre-pandemic results. 
If you look at the total business, you will see that on a comparable 9-month pro forma basis, the new IFF has realized 9% sales growth over 2019 results. This strength is broad-based too. Each segment is realizing strong growth above pre-pandemic levels. Nourish is a business that was particularly hard hit through the pandemic, is now strongly growing with sales growth of 9% compared to pro forma 2019 9-month period. Important, especially given that much of the integration work is coming from within this division. These results showcase how our position in the market has been fundamentally strengthened through the merger and how our teams are delivering the full potential of IFF to our customers. 
Moving to Slide 11, I would like to discuss the strong progress we have made in terms of synergy realization. For just 9 months, since completing our merger with N&B, our synergy progress reaffirms the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us as a combined company. Having received significant and highly encouraging positive feedback from our customers, along with persistent robust customer demand, we are confident in our ability to meet our revenue target. 
To date, revenue synergies have started to contribute to our top line performance, and we are pleased that our project pipeline is strong and growing. In the first 9 months of 2021, we've achieved approximately $40 million in cost synergies, representing nearly 90% of our 2021 cost synergy target with 1 quarter to go. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings programs we have implemented, where we are leveraging our increased scale and optimizing our organization. I'm confident that we will more than exceed our $45 million year 1 synergy target. And I'm encouraged by the continued progress we are making towards achieving our 3-year run rate of cost synergy target of $300 million. 
Now before I turn the call over to Glenn, I want to spend a second to really underscore what he brings to us here at IFF. His background is perfect, but there are 2 areas I think really stand out. First, he brings tremendous steps with private and public companies and leading finance teams to enhance discipline and build processes that drive towards a goal of shareholder value creation. He has time and time again, shown an ability to help businesses accelerate top line growth while driving margin expansion. In this way, we consistently implement productivity initiatives with lasting impact. Second, he has been through several large-scale M&A integrations with a track record of strong success. As we continue to execute on our multiyear transformational integration, this experience is invaluable. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn."
281407,1686435170,2431096,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2021",2021-11-09,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is wh",2112,"Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is why did I join IFF and what are my near-term priorities. Consequently, before I review our financial results, I thought it would be helpful to briefly provide these perspectives as an introduction. 
There were 3 very compelling reasons for me to join IFF. First, and perhaps most importantly, IFF is a company that is truly making a difference in helping solve some of the world's biggest challenges. We are delivering reliable, innovative and sustainable solutions that are directly helping address issues such as improved nutrition and wellness, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating a more sustainable environment. 
Second, the industry has very attractive organic growth characteristics, benefiting from continued strong consumer tailwinds from increased consumer focus on wellness, and natural and sustainable products, increased demand in emerging markets and new consumer needs presented by aging demographics in developed markets. I also believe that scale will become an important basis of competitive advantage as customers demand leading ESG platforms, increased innovation and speed to market, global supply chain resiliency and help in navigating increasingly complex regulations. 
Third, I firmly believe that the combination of IFF with DuPont's legacy N&B business has uniquely created an industry-leading platform. And since joining IFF, I've tried to immerse myself in the business completely visiting sites, meeting with our business and operations teams and spending time at our R&D and creative centers. I've also prioritized hearing from you, our investors and analysts. And frankly, today, I'm even more bullish on the strength of IFF's global capabilities and the tremendous long-term potential we have to drive strong top and bottom line growth.
Now to my near-term priorities, I have 4 primary areas of focus, are far our most pressing priorities to tackle the challenges from the global inflationary environment and to successfully execute broad-based pricing actions across all of our businesses. Second, I'm also focused on enhancing our core financial processes and metrics, including better forecasting, improved business level return metrics and tighter disciplines for our investment decisions, so that we're maximizing our growth potential and return on invested capital. A third area of focus is ensuring we fully deliver on our merger synergies, while also accelerating our focus on sustainable productivity. And finally, while we have made very good progress to date on our portfolio optimization, there is significant opportunity remaining. In the days and months ahead, I look forward to learning even more about this organization and engaging with all of you. 
With that, I'd now like to provide an overview of our consolidated third quarter results. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, primarily driven by the continued double-digit growth in our Nourish division and strong increases in both Scent and Health & Biosciences. In terms of contribution, volume performance was the primary driver of our growth as pricing represented approximately 2 percentage points in the quarter. 
Though our gross margin continued to be challenged by inflationary pressures, it was somewhat offset by our strong cost management focus, which resulted in adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. And while we had solid year-over-year EBITDA growth, our gross margin was down by 210 basis points as our pricing actions recovered only about 65% of our raw material increases or approximately 50% in the third quarter when we include raw material, logistics and energy increases. 
As we move forward, we are squarely focused on improving this recovery rate relative to the total inflationary basis but expect that in the short term, specifically the fourth quarter, we will see a similar pressure given the time lag of price realization. Let me finish on this slide by saying that we achieved strong earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.47. 
On the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the third quarter financial results for each of our 4 divisions. Turning to Slide 13, I'll start with our Nourish division, which had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, Nourish achieved 17% year-over-year sales growth or 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in flavors for the second consecutive quarter. Ingredients also grew double digits with all subcategories, protein solutions, [ tefton ] and seaweed extracts, emulsifiers and sweeteners and cellulosics, LPG and food protection, increasing double digits. 
Food design also grew double digits, led by food service, where pandemic related restrictions continue to be lifted with away-from-home consumer behaviors returning to more typical levels. As a result of strong volume growth, price increases and our focus on cost management, Nourish achieved an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 19% and margin expansion of 30 basis points.
On Slide 14, you'll see that our Health & Biosciences division saw year-over-year sales growth of 7% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home & Personal Care and high single-digit growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes. Our Health category was soft this quarter due to a particularly strong double-digit year-ago comparison, so we are pleased with the results when we look at it on a 2-year basis. 
As Andreas mentioned earlier, inflationary pressures and higher logistics and energy costs to keep up with the robust customer demand has challenged our margins across our business, with H&B particularly impacted, which drove an operating EBITDA decrease of 12%. Unpacking this a bit deeper, the bulk or 70% of our year-over-year EBITDA decline came from higher air freight volumes, where we have increased intercompany shipments to manage available capacity. As we shared last quarter, we have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and have also invested in R&D and plant technology to increase output. Until then, we will be incurring higher costs to support our customer demand, and this will impact our EBITDA margin. 
Turning now to Slide 15. Our Scent division continues to perform extremely well and experienced strong growth, achieving 10% year-over-year growth or 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This performance was driven by Fine Fragrances' continued rebound, which grew approximately 36%, led by new customer wins and improved volumes. Our Ingredients category also continues to perform well and contributed to Scent's overall success, seeing double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter led by strong performance in both Cosmetic Actives and Fragrance Ingredients. 
While our Consumer Fragrances business saw modest low single-digit growth against a strong double-digit year ago comparison, this is a marked improvement from Q2, and we expect further growth as we move forward. On a 2-year average basis, Consumer Fragrance remained strong at 9% in the third quarter. Scent also experienced adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 10%, driven by strong volume growth and favorable mix. Margin was down modestly due to higher raw materials and logistics costs, a trend we see continuing. I will provide more context shortly. 
Lastly, in our Pharma Solutions business, we saw a current seat-neutral sales decrease of 2% due to continued supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistics disruptions, which have made it challenging to meet persistent and growing customer demand. While Industrials has continued to recover from COVID-19 lows, our core Pharma business saw soft performance against its solid year-ago comparison. The division's adjusted operating EBITDA and margin also continue to be impacted by higher sourcing, logistics and manufacturing costs. We also continue to see the impact of force majeures and raw material shortages, with suppliers and shutdowns due to Hurricane Ida, resulting in unplanned outages in some of our product lines. 
While we expect the current market environment and macro supply chain problems to continue challenging the segment, we remain optimistic and as Andreas mentioned earlier, we remain focused on returning the division to profitability as these industry conditions stabilize. 
Now on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position and leverage dynamics for the first 9 months of 2021, both of which remain a top priority for us. So far this year, IFF has generated $884 million in free cash flow, with cash flow from operations totaling approximately $1.1 billion. As the team has mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in our growth accretive businesses as well as integration activities. Year-to-date, we have spent $242 million or approximately 2.8% of sales on CapEx and expect a significant ramp-up in fourth quarter as our annual spend is traditionally more back half weighted. 
From a leverage perspective, we are continuing to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target, with our cash and cash equivalents finishing at $794 million, including $122 million restricted cash, with gross debt reduced by $446 million versus the second quarter to $11.5 billion due to our debt maturity schedule as part of our deleverage plan. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.7 billion, with a 4.1x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA. With our continued strong cash flow generation, including proceeds from divested noncore businesses, we remain confident that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of less than 3x net debt to EBITDA within 20 to 36 months, post-transaction close. 
Turning to Slide 18. I'd like to take a moment to discuss the cost inflation trends that have impacted our business this year. As I mentioned earlier, IFF and the industry at large have seen significant year-over-year inflation increases, which have been accelerating in the recent quarter. The inflationary pressures we are seeing today are significant. Just as examples, vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. The price of wheat is up almost 40% in the last 12 months through October. Brent crude prices have more than doubled over the past 12 months, the highest level since October 2018. In the U.S., natural gas prices are up 100% from a year ago and in the U.K. grew up about 50%. And transportation rates have increased significantly given the high demand and limited capacity to ship. 
Across the raw materials, logistics and energy markets, like many industries around the world, we have seen costs accelerate each quarter, which has led to our margins being adversely impacted. For example, in the first half of 2021, gross margin was down about 150 basis points, while in the third quarter, we were down about 210 basis points. As we look ahead, we are being prudent in our planning as we expect these inflationary pressures will continue throughout the fourth quarter and over the course of 2022. Consequently, this will require us to successfully implement significant pricing actions across each of our businesses as well as improve our sourcing efficiencies and accelerate operational improvements and capture targeted integration synergies to drive profit growth. 
Now moving to Slide 19. I would like to share what this means for our consolidated financial outlook. For the full year 2021, we are maintaining the increased total revenue forecast we announced in September to account for the strong demand. For the full year 2021, we are targeting $11.55 billion in total revenue or approximately 8.5% growth, up from the forecast of $11.4 billion or 7% growth that we disclosed in the second quarter. We also expect our sales growth to continue in the fourth quarter as our Q4 quarter-to-date sales trend is solid. 
As mentioned, unprecedented macro supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures continue to impact our industry, and we do expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. While we are intently focused on offsetting these inflationary pressures through pricing actions, these are lagging the inflationary pressures. And as a result, we have further revised our adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly below 21%, down from approximately 21.5% that was forecasted in September. About half of this reduction is due to lower gross margin in the third quarter and the other half stemming from higher cost trends we see in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we are targeting low single-digit EBITDA growth, a solid improvement in light of the external challenges. We also adjusted our CapEx spend outlook down as we have been very thoughtful in balancing near-term operating priorities with the need to add capacity to support accretive growth across our businesses. Overall, we are pleased of the progress we've made to date, strong top line growth and a commitment to meet near-term macro cost pressures, and we're confident that IFF is on the right path and poised for continued success across our core business. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

Before I wrap it up, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of IFF and our thousands of employees around the world who have showcased a remarkable resilience toward an evolving and continuously uncertain industry environment. We have continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales and profit growth, and I'm confident that with our top-notch financial and operational structure supported by Glenn's financial leadership, we will be able to maintain and bolster our strong financial profile, while continuing to deliver for both our shareholders and our customers. 
Q4 is off to a solid start, and I know that our momentum will propel us to achieve strong sales growth for the full year and bring us another step closer to achieving our synergy targets. In sum, it is clear to me that IFF is in an incredible strong position. We knew entering this year that the new IFF was poised to change our industry. But to do so, we had to execute. As we look at industry-leading sales growth for the full year, I'm just so proud of how everyone here stepped up and executed on our vision and delivered against our potential. IFF is once again the clear leader of this field, creating another iconic chapter in this company's 132-year legacy. 
This core strength of the business is why I felt now was the perfect time to start the transition to find IFF's next CEO. I have every confidence that now is the right time to let the next chapter of IFF legacy begin. As we announced, the search has begun for my successor, and we expect that person to be in place by early 2022. I'm fully committed to a seamless transition and look forward to talking to you all of this more in the near future. Thank you all for your support.

First of all, relative to top line, as we mentioned, we're very pleased. We're tracking extremely well versus the long-term targets. And then when you take a look at how we're tracking versus competition, which is another great indicator we're actually very, very pleased in terms of there. So we sort of checked that. 
We would say relative to our deleverage target getting below 3x by year 3, we're feeling very comfortable with that. The combination of the cash flow generation from the business remains strong. And as you know, we've announced a couple of divestitures, and we continue to look at other noncore businesses. So I would check both that, both the deleverage as well as our free cash flow. 
The area that really needs work is around our long-term margin objective. As you know, we have a 26% EBITDA margin target. That was easier when we started off with a higher number at the beginning of the year and versus the most recent guidance, we're now about 500 basis points of that relative to the guidance this year. So as we approach our '22 plan, we're spending energy sort of thinking about that multiyear target. 
I think structurally, there are a couple of factors that we think still play in the favor of not only increasing where we are from an EBITDA margin, but potentially getting us back to that. One is clearly the biggest impact this year unexpected has been the inflationary environment. And we'll probably talk more about this, but we've lost about 200 basis points this year at our margin relative to inflation, net of what we expect to price. And in addition, we've had some pockets of higher use of freight costs in a couple of our businesses. So that's about 200 basis points. We still feel very confident on achieving the long-term synergy objectives, so the cost synergies. 
And I would submit there's sort of probably additional productivity in the business. We -- if you strip out the material side of our business, we have over $4 billion of cost between our manufacturing operations and then [ RSNA ]. And I think we've just sort of begun to scratch the surface relative to that with our synergy targets. That being said, we are working very intently right now to sort of think about and actuate our pricing initiatives and also think about a longer-term productivity as well."

I'll start with answering and then maybe turn it over to Andreas. In general, the biggest hit, as I just mentioned on our business this year, has basically been material cost broadly impacting our business. Of the 200 basis points, it has impacted us and anticipated impact is about 200 basis points in terms of margin. About 2/3 of that is related to rate increases. So that's a combination of our raw materials, our energy and our logistics costs. 
What's happening relative to each of those buckets is earlier in the year, we were thinking mid-single-digit relative to inflation in raw materials, it's now high single digits, approaching 10% in terms of the annual inflation. We're seeing logistics costs continue to accelerate that to the mid-teens. And then energy, as everyone is well aware, has been extremely volatile, and it's been trending up about 30% year-over-year. By the way, the planning posture for '21 is we really had relatively flat inflationary pressure. So we didn't expect any of our material cost to go up. So we have a much, much more significant impact relative to what we'd anticipated just a couple of quarters ago. 
I would say the rest of our cost structure is working quite well. We have actually delivered strong results against our R&D, sales and administrative expenses. We're actually exceeding plan relative to our costs. So we're actually lower at that point. In general, manufacturing is working on productivity, although constraints in our system have limited some of the capacity gains we can get in some of the efficiencies out of the system. 
The pricing dynamics are that we are working very, very aggressively on capturing the pricing. But to date, we're capturing and expect to capture only about $0.50 on the dollar from inflation this year. And that's simply a lag factor relative to our ability to go to market and implement. I will note that as we look out in '22, we are anticipating those inflationary trends to continue into next year, and we are basically planning our pricing actions accordingly, i.e. each of our businesses are thinking about not only what has hit us this year, but what we anticipate to hit next year, and we're executing against that. 
To your last point on pace, that extended by business. We have some, but not a lot of multiyear contracts. In a lot of most cases, we have annual contracts, and in many -- or not most of those cases, they tend to run on a fiscal cycle, so beginning of the year forward. But last comment I would make is we're sort of in, I'd say, unprecedented environment, given the level of inflation. So it is affording us an opportunity to go back in almost all cases to our customers and discuss the inflationary environment vis-a-vis our pricing going forward, even when we have sort of contractual relationships in place. So let me maybe turn it over to Andreas."

But here, I think there's another element in it is we are working to increase capacity because there's a lot of demand, in particular for our Enzyme business and we are building -- we just installed new fermenters in Hanko in Finland, and there's more to come for the first half of next year, which will help us to decrease logistic costs here as well and fulfill what we get in terms of demand from our customers. We're very optimistic on this one because the technology is superior, and it's certainly a good growth driver for us going forward."

Synergy realization is going actually on the cost synergies extremely well. As you have seen, we have already realized $40 million in the first 3 quarters of the $45 million we have promised. So it's very, very likely that we will overachieve. On the sales synergies, we are very much on track. And I see when I visit our facilities, and I was basically out there in the field the last week in Europe, but the teams are working very nicely and very, very well together. So we see that more sales synergies are coming in. And that shows that we are building a very, very strong position for the company going forward. 
In terms of the different categories as well, we see still a good -- and good performance on the Fine Fragrance side, which is very, very helpful. It's not just a good recovery, but it goes with growth rate here as well. And that's helping the whole result for the company going forward. I think that's what we can say about the fourth quarter."

Just as a follow-up to that, really, we're focused on aggressively implementing late this year into '22 on that front. 
Of the full year margin guidance, and relative to the freight impact, we have about 200 basis points associated with cost. About 2/3 of that is pure rate and about 1/3 of that or about 60 basis points is related to higher usages of freight, principally air and principally to support our H&B business because of capacity limitations. So that piece, as Andreas had mentioned, will take us some time to work out through '22 as we address some of the capacity constraints."

Indeed, many of our customers see good bulk increases.

So just curious about the general nature of the business. Is it tougher to take pricing there?"

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone, and I thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our performance results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated colleagues around the world, who have continued to work tirelessly in a challenging environment to fuel the global consumer goods supply chain and meet our customers' needs. I can't thank each and every one of you enough for your hard work, dedication and focus.  
I also want to take a moment and welcome Glenn Richter, who is joining us on today's call for the first time. As you know, Glenn joined us a little over a month ago as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm sure you will all find that his experience aligns perfectly with our strategic goals, making him an incredible asset to our team. I also want to thank Rustom for his leadership and contributions during his time as IFF's CFO. Rustom played an important role in our combination with DuPont N&B. And for that, we are immensely grateful. He has been important in putting IFF in the strong position it is today. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors.  
On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of year-to-date performance, including the progress we have made so far on our integration. I will then turn it over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question-and-answer session, Glenn will also speak to our outlook for the remainder of the year.  
Now as I mentioned, I'd like to kick us off on Slide 6 by discussing our financial highlights for the first 9 months of 2021. Throughout the third quarter, we remained laser focused on extending the momentum IFF established in the first half of 2021. In the first 9 months of 2021, IFF achieved $8.6 billion in sales, representing 10% growth or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, a strong reflection of the strength of our market-leading platform and the compelling position we have established with our customers as a combined company. We delivered a 22% adjusted operating EBITDA margin and a combined EBITDA growth of 5%. As we will discuss in more detail, we continue to confront meaningful inflationary pressure due to higher raw material, logistics and energy costs.  
We have maintained our robust cost discipline efforts and are entering the fourth quarter with continued financial strength, having achieved $884 million free cash flow or approximately 10% of our trailing 9 months sales, driven by strong cash generation. This cash generation has enabled us to stay on track to meeting our deleveraging target.  
Finally, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, continued refinement and optimization of our portfolio is a critical component of our ongoing integration efforts. I'm pleased to share that we have completed the divestiture of our food preparation business and are on track to complete the divestiture of our microbial control business in the second quarter of 2022. Together, these 2 important divestitures will create a more focused IFF, allowing us to hone in on the constraints of our core business segments and it creates a stronger, more focused business.  
We will continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio as we move forward with our integration, looking for opportunities to rapidly divesting other noncore businesses. We started this year with a simple commitment to focus on execution and deliver on the potential of the new IFF. I'm pleased to say that even in a very challenging global environment, our team has met our integration objectives, while delivering strong results with continued sales momentum and profit growth.  
Now turning to Slide 7. I'd like to walk you through some of the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the last 9 months. First, I'm excited to share that we continue to experience strong growth in all 4 of our key operating regions despite ongoing and unique market uncertainties that have persisted across each geography. In North America, we achieved 7% growth across all 4 of IFF's business divisions, led by high single-digit growth in Nourish and Scent. These 2 divisions have continued to perform exceptionally well, quarter after quarter.  
In Asia, we experienced a 7% increase in sales led by continued double-digit growth in India as well as a low single-digit growth in China, even amidst particularly strong recent market complexities in the region. From a business unit perspective, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions continued to carry the region's growth throughout the year-to-date.  
Latin America continues to be our strongest performing region and sales growth leader, having achieved 12% growth, largely fueled by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and continued local currency strength.  
Perhaps, most impressive is a 7% sales growth that our EMEA region achieved to date, which includes a robust double-digit increase in the third quarter, impressive performance on our Scent and Nourish divisions growth, this encouraging rebound with Scent delivering double-digit growth led by our Fine Fragrance business and Nourish delivering high single-digit growth led by our Food Service business. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, and we will stay diligent to ensure our business remains nimble, positioned to perform against any new supply chain challenges that may arise.  
Moving now to Slide 8, I'd like to take a closer look at our 9 months year-to-date sales performance across IFF's key business segments. Our largest division, Nourish, has been a strong performer throughout the year, achieving currency-neutral sales growth of 9% with broad-based strength from our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Scent has had a similar strong year delivering 8% in currency-neutral growth to date, led by impressive double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance as well as strong growth in Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients.  
Health & Bioscience has seen strong demand in key focus areas including Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Cultures & Food Enzymes. As you know, we are in the process of selling our Microbial Control unit, which has continued to experience headwinds through this year but has rebounded from COVID-impacted lows with growth in both Q2 and Q3. This divestiture should further enhance the performance of this important division.  
Pharma Solutions, despite significant challenges, is flat so far for the year. Supply chain challenges have had an outsized impact on this division throughout the year. While we have seen encouraging growth in our Industrial business, the division still struggles to meet customer demand due to raw material availability challenges and logistics issues.  
Now on Slide 9, you will see that we have outlined some of the factors influencing the growth and profitability of each of our 4 divisions so far this year. As I previously mentioned, Nourish has had a strong year with Flavors and Ingredients experiencing double-digit growth. We have been working hard in our execution to manage volume and cost to limit margin impact from higher raw material costs, which continued to be a headwind on our profitability. While we have seen some margin impact of about 20 basis points in the year, we are proud of how our execution has mitigated much of the negative headwinds, while delivering meaningful growth.  
Our team has did an exceptional job increasing prices to combat inflationary pressures, something that will continue to be critical as we move forward.  
In Health & Bioscience, we mentioned broad-based growth across the markets, but here, we are seeing significant margin impacts from higher logistic costs. As shared on our second quarter call, part of this that freight rates have increased significantly, but also we are having higher logistic costs to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth, investing in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year and into 2022.  
The Scent division has certainly realized the strongest, all-around bounce back as consumer demand rises across end markets. Notably, Fine Fragrances alone has realized 36% growth year-to-date with double-digit growth in Cosmetic Active and continued solid performance in Consumer Fragrances. At the time, sales profitability expansion of 110 basis points has been led by higher volume, favorable mix and higher productivity.  
As I mentioned, Pharma Solutions was the only division in which we did not experience sales growth due to continued global supply chain challenges that have impacted our ability to meet strong customer demand. These challenges, including supply and logistic constraints and ongoing inflation have, in turn, significantly pressured our margin compared to the first 9 months of 2020.  
Moving to the fourth quarter and entering 2022, we will be closely tracking supply chain dynamics, and we'll continue to prioritize returning our Pharma Solutions business to the profitability we know is achievable. And in the fourth quarter, we're expecting year-over-year top and bottom line performance to improve.  
As we have been talking about today, IFF is realizing very strong sales momentum across our business. This is a reflection of the powerful new position we have created through our combination with the N&B business and a compelling value proposition we can offer to our customers. While we are pleased to put many of the gross headwinds related to the pandemic behind us, it is important to understand that our growth this year is, in fact, meaningful above pre-pandemic results.  
If you look at the total business, you will see that on a comparable 9-month pro forma basis, the new IFF has realized 9% sales growth over 2019 results. This strength is broad-based too. Each segment is realizing strong growth above pre-pandemic levels. Nourish is a business that was particularly hard hit through the pandemic, is now strongly growing with sales growth of 9% compared to pro forma 2019 9-month period. And important, especially given that much of the integration work is coming from within this division, these results showcase how our position in the market has been fundamentally strengthened through the merger and how our teams are delivering the full potential of IFF to our customers.  
Moving to Slide 11, I would like to discuss the strong progress we have made in terms of synergy realization. For just 9 months, since completing our merger with N&B, our synergy progress reaffirms the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us as a combined company. Having received significant and highly encouraging positive feedback from our customers, along with persistent robust customer demand, we are confident in our ability to meet our revenue target.  
To date, revenue synergies have started to contribute to our top line performance, and we are pleased that our project pipeline is strong and growing. In the first 9 months of 2021, we've achieved approximately $40 million in cost synergies, representing nearly 90% of our 2021 cost synergy target with 1 quarter to go. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings programs we have implemented, where we are leveraging our increased scale and optimizing our organization. I'm confident that we will more than exceed our $45 million year 1 synergy target. And I'm encouraged by the continued progress we are making towards achieving our 3-year run rate of cost synergy target of $300 million.  
Now before I turn the call over to Glenn, I want to spend a second to really underscore what he brings to us here at IFF. His background is perfect, but there are 2 areas I think really stand out. First, he brings tremendous depth with private and public companies and leading finance teams to enhance discipline and build processes that drive towards a goal of shareholder value creation. He has time and time again shown an ability to help businesses accelerate top line growth while driving margin expansion. In this way, he consistently implements productivity initiatives with lasting impact. Second, he has been through several large-scale M&A integrations with a track record of strong success. As we continue to execute on our multiyear transformational integration, this experience is invaluable.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn."
281407,1686435170,2431350,"International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2021",2021-11-09,"Earnings Calls","International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.","Executives","Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is wh",2106,"Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is why did I join IFF and what are my near-term priorities. Consequently, before I review our financial results, I thought it would be helpful to briefly provide these perspectives as an introduction.  
There were 3 very compelling reasons for me to join IFF. First, and perhaps most importantly, IFF is a company that is truly making a difference in helping solve some of the world's biggest challenges. We are delivering reliable, innovative and sustainable solutions that are directly helping address issues such as improved nutrition and wellness, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating a more sustainable environment.  
Second, the industry has very attractive organic growth characteristics, benefiting from continued strong consumer tailwinds from increased consumer focus on wellness and natural and sustainable products, increased demand in emerging markets and new consumer needs presented by aging demographics in developed markets. I also believe that scale will become an important basis of competitive advantage as customers demand leading ESG platforms, increased innovation and speed to market, global supply chain resiliency and help in navigating increasingly complex regulations.  
Third, I firmly believe that the combination of IFF with DuPont's legacy N&B business has uniquely created an industry-leading platform. And since joining IFF, I've tried to immerse myself in the business completely, visiting sites, meeting with our business and operations teams and spending time at our R&D and creative centers. I've also prioritized hearing from you, our investors and analysts. And frankly, today, I'm even more bullish on the strength of IFF's global capabilities and the tremendous long-term potential we have to drive strong top and bottom line growth.
Relative to my near-term priorities, I have 4 primary areas of focus. By far, our most pressing priority is to tackle the challenges from the global inflationary environment and to successfully execute broad-based pricing actions across all of our businesses. Second, I'm also focused on enhancing our core financial processes and metrics, including better forecasting, improved business-level return metrics and tighter disciplines for our investment decisions, so that we're maximizing our growth potential and return on invested capital. A third area of focus is ensuring we fully deliver on our merger synergies, while also accelerating our focus on sustainable productivity. And finally, while we have made very good progress to date on our portfolio optimization, there is significant opportunity remaining. In the days and months ahead, I look forward to learning even more about this organization and engaging with all of you. 
With that, I'd now like to provide an overview of our consolidated third quarter results. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, primarily driven by the continued double-digit growth in our Nourish division and strong increases in both Scent and Health & Biosciences. In terms of contribution, volume performance was the primary driver of our growth as pricing represented approximately 2 percentage points in the quarter. 
Though our gross margin continued to be challenged by inflationary pressures, it was somewhat offset by our strong cost management focus, which resulted in adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. And while we had solid year-over-year EBITDA growth, our gross margin was down by 210 basis points as our pricing actions recovered only about 65% of our raw material increases or approximately 50% in the third quarter when we include raw material, logistics and energy increases. 
As we move forward, we are squarely focused on improving this recovery rate relative to the total inflationary basis but expect that in the short term, specifically the fourth quarter, we will see a similar pressure given the time lag of price realization. Let me finish on this slide by saying that we achieved strong earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.47. 
On the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the third quarter financial results for each of our 4 divisions. Turning to Slide 13, I'll start with our Nourish division, which had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, Nourish achieved 17% year-over-year sales growth or 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors for the second consecutive quarter. Ingredients also grew double digits with all subcategories, protein solutions, pectin and seaweed extracts, emulsifiers and sweeteners and cellulosics, LPG and food protection, increasing double digits. 
Food Design also grew double digits, led by Food Service, where pandemic-related restrictions continue to be lifted with away-from-home consumer behaviors returning to more typical levels. As a result of strong volume growth, price increases and our focus on cost management, Nourish achieved an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 19% and margin expansion of 30 basis points.
On Slide 14, you'll see that our Health & Biosciences division saw year-over-year sales growth of 7% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home & Personal Care and high single-digit growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes. Our Health category was soft this quarter due to a particularly strong double-digit year-ago comparison, so we are pleased with the results when we look at it on a 2-year basis. 
As Andreas mentioned earlier, inflationary pressures and higher logistics and energy costs to keep up with the robust customer demand has challenged our margins across our business, with H&B particularly impacted, which drove an operating EBITDA decrease of 12%. Unpacking this a bit deeper, the bulk or 70% of our year-over-year EBITDA decline came from higher air freight volumes, where we have increased intercompany shipments to manage available capacity. As we shared last quarter, we have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and have also invested in R&D and plant technology to increase output. Until then, we will be incurring higher costs to support our customer demand, and this will impact our EBITDA margin. 
Turning now to Slide 15. Our Scent division continues to perform extremely well and experienced strong growth, achieving 10% year-over-year growth or 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This performance was driven by Fine Fragrances' continued rebound, which grew approximately 36%, led by new customer wins and improved volumes. Our Ingredients category also continues to perform well and contributed to Scent's overall success, seeing double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter led by strong performance in both Cosmetic Actives and Fragrance Ingredients. 
While our Consumer Fragrances business saw modest low single-digit growth against a strong double-digit year ago comparison, this is a marked improvement from Q2, and we expect further growth as we move forward. On a 2-year average basis, Consumer Fragrance remained strong at 9% in the third quarter. Scent also experienced adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 10%, driven by strong volume growth and favorable mix. Margin was down modestly due to higher raw materials and logistics costs, a trend we see continuing. I will provide more context shortly. 
Lastly, in our Pharma Solutions business, we saw a currency-neutral sales decrease of 2% due to continued supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistics disruptions, which have made it challenging to meet persistent and growing customer demand. While Industrials has continued to recover from COVID-19 lows, our core Pharma business saw soft performance against its solid year-ago comparison. The division's adjusted operating EBITDA and margin also continue to be impacted by higher sourcing, logistics and manufacturing costs. We also continue to see the impact of force majeures and raw material shortages with suppliers and shutdowns due to Hurricane Ida, resulting in unplanned outages in some of our product lines. 
While we expect the current market environment and macro supply chain problems to continue challenging the segment, we remain optimistic and as Andreas mentioned earlier, we remain focused on returning the division to profitability as these industry conditions stabilize. 
Now on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position and leverage dynamics for the first 9 months of 2021, both of which remain a top priority for us. So far this year, IFF has generated $884 million in free cash flow, with cash flow from operations totaling approximately $1.1 billion. As the team has mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in our growth accretive businesses as well as integration activities. Year-to-date, we have spent $242 million or approximately 2.8% of sales on CapEx and expect a significant ramp-up in fourth quarter as our annual spend is traditionally more back half weighted. 
From a leverage perspective, we are continuing to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target, with our cash and cash equivalents finishing at $794 million, including $122 million restricted cash, with gross debt reduced by $446 million versus the second quarter to $11.5 billion due to our debt maturity schedule as part of our deleverage plan. Our trailing 12-month credit-adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.7 billion, with a 4.1x net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA. With our continued strong cash flow generation, including proceeds from divested noncore businesses, we remain confident that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of less than 3x net debt to EBITDA within 20 to 36 months, post-transaction close. 
Turning to Slide 18. I'd like to take a moment to discuss the cost inflation trends that have impacted our business this year. As I mentioned earlier, IFF and the industry at large have seen significant year-over-year inflation increases, which have been accelerating in the recent quarter. The inflationary pressures we are seeing today are significant. Just as examples, vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. The price of wheat is up almost 40% in the last 12 months through October. Brent crude prices have more than doubled over the past 12 months to the highest level since October 2018. In the U.S., natural gas prices are up 100% from a year ago and in the U.K. grew up about 500%. And transportation rates have increased significantly given the high demand and limited capacity to ship. 
Across the raw materials, logistics and energy markets, like many industries around the world, we have seen costs accelerate each quarter, which has led to our margins being adversely impacted. For example, in the first half of 2021, gross margin was down about 150 basis points, while in the third quarter, we were down about 210 basis points. As we look ahead, we are being prudent in our planning as we expect these inflationary pressures will continue throughout the fourth quarter and over the course of 2022. Consequently, this will require us to successfully implement significant pricing actions across each of our businesses as well as improve our sourcing efficiencies, accelerate operational improvements and capture targeted integration synergies to drive profit growth. 
Now moving to Slide 19. I would like to share what this means for our consolidated financial outlook. For the full year 2021, we are maintaining the increased total revenue forecast we announced in September to account for the strong demand. For the full year 2021, we are targeting $11.55 billion in total revenue or approximately 8.5% growth, up from the forecast of $11.4 billion or 7% growth that we disclosed in the second quarter. We also expect our sales growth to continue in the fourth quarter as our Q4 quarter-to-date sales trend is solid. 
As mentioned, unprecedented macro supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures continue to impact our industry, and we do expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. While we are intently focused on offsetting these inflationary pressures through pricing actions, these are lagging the inflationary pressures. And as a result, we have further revised our adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly below 21%, down from approximately 21.5% that was forecasted in September. About half of this reduction is due to lower gross margin in the third quarter and the other half stemming from higher cost trends we see in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we are targeting low single-digit EBITDA growth, a solid improvement in light of the external challenges. We also adjusted our CapEx spend outlook down as we have been very thoughtful in balancing near-term operating priorities with the need to add capacity to support accretive growth across our businesses. Overall, we are pleased of the progress we've made to date, strong top line growth and a commitment to meet near-term macro cost pressures, and we're confident that IFF is on the right path and poised for continued success across our core business. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks."

Before I wrap it up, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of IFF and our thousands of employees around the world who have showcased a remarkable resilience toward an evolving and continuously uncertain industry environment. We have continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales and profit growth, and I'm confident that with our top-notch financial and operational structure supported by Glenn's financial leadership, we will be able to maintain and bolster our strong financial profile, while continuing to deliver for both our shareholders and our customers. 
Q4 is off to a solid start, and I know that our momentum will propel us to achieve strong sales growth for the full year and bring us another step closer to achieving our synergy targets. In sum, it is clear to me that IFF is in an incredible strong position. We knew entering this year that the new IFF was poised to change our industry. But to do so, we had to execute. As we look at industry-leading sales growth for the full year, I'm just so proud of how everyone here stepped up and executed on our vision and delivered against our potential. IFF is once again the clear leader of this field, creating another iconic chapter in this company's 132-year legacy. 
This core strength of the business is why I felt now was the perfect time to start the transition to find IFF's next CEO. I have every confidence that now is the right time to let the next chapter of IFF legacy begin. As we announced, the search has begun for my successor, and we expect that person to be in place by early 2022.

Thanks for the question. We have to sort of break them down relative to the component parts. First of all, relative to top line, as we mentioned, we're very pleased.

First of all, relative to top line, as we mentioned, we're very pleased. We're tracking extremely well versus the long-term targets. And then when you take a look at how we're tracking versus competition, which is another great indicator, we're actually very pleased in terms of there. So we sort of checked that. 
We would say relative to our deleverage target, getting below 3x by year 3, we're feeling very comfortable with that. The combination of the cash flow generation from the business remains strong. And as you know, we've announced a couple of divestitures, and we continue to look at other noncore businesses. So I would check both that, both the deleverage as well as our free cash flow. 
The area that really needs work is around our long-term margin objective. As you know, we have a 26% EBITDA margin target. That was easier when we started off with a higher number at the beginning of the year. And versus the most recent guidance, we're now about 500 basis points off that relative to the guidance this year. So as we approach our '22 plan, we're spending energy sort of thinking about that multiyear target. 
I think structurally, there are a couple of factors that we think still play in favor of not only increasing where we are from an EBITDA margin, but potentially getting us back to that. One is clearly the biggest impact this year unexpected has been the inflationary environment. And Andreas will probably talk more about this, but we've lost about 200 basis points this year at our margin relative to inflation, net of what we expect to price. And in addition, we've had some pockets of higher use of freight costs in a couple of our businesses. So that's about 200 basis points. We still feel very confident on achieving the long-term synergy objectives, so the cost synergies. 
And I would submit there's sort of probably additional productivity in the business. We -- if you strip out the material side of our business, we have over $4 billion of cost between our manufacturing operations and then our S&A. And I think we've just sort of begun to scratch the surface relative to that with our synergy targets. That being said, we are working very intently right now to sort of think about and actuate our pricing initiatives and also think about our longer-term productivity as well."

I'll start with answering and then maybe turn it over to Andreas. In general, the biggest hit, as I just mentioned on our business this year, has basically been material cost broadly impacting our business. Of the 200 basis points, it has impacted us and anticipated impact is about 200 basis points in terms of margin. About 2/3 of that is related to rate increases. So that's a combination of our raw materials, our energy and our logistics costs. 
What's happening relative to each of those buckets is earlier in the year, we were thinking mid-single-digit relative to inflation in raw materials. It's now high single digits, approaching 10% in terms of the annual inflation. We're seeing logistics costs continue to accelerate that to the mid-teens. And then energy, as everyone is well aware, has been extremely volatile, and it's been trending up about 30% year-over-year. By the way, the planning posture for '21 is we really had relatively flat inflationary pressure. So we didn't expect any of our material cost to go up. So we have a much, much more significant impact relative to what we'd anticipated just a couple of quarters ago. 
I would say the rest of our cost structure is working quite well. We have actually delivered strong results against our R&D, sales and administrative expenses. We're actually exceeding plan relative to our costs. So we're actually lower at that point. In general, manufacturing is working on productivity, although constraints in our system have limited some of the capacity gains we can get in some of the efficiencies out of the system. 
The pricing dynamics are that we are working very, very aggressively on capturing the pricing. But to date, we're capturing and expect to capture only about $0.50 on the dollar from inflation this year. And that's simply a lag factor relative to our ability to go to market and implement. I will note that as we look out in '22, we are anticipating those inflationary trends to continue into next year, and we are basically planning our pricing actions accordingly, i.e. each of our businesses are thinking about not only what has hit us this year, but what we anticipate to hit next year, and we're executing against that. 
To your last point on pace, that depends by business. We have some but not a lot of multiyear contracts. In a lot of most cases, we have annual contracts, and in many of -- or not most of those cases, they tend to run on a fiscal cycle, so beginning of the year forward. But last comment I would make is we're sort of in, I'd say, unprecedented environment, given the level of inflation. So it is affording us an opportunity to go back in almost all cases to our customers and discuss the inflationary environment vis-a-vis our pricing going forward, even when we have sort of contractual relationships in place. So let me maybe turn it over to Andreas."

But here, I think there's another element in it is we are working to increase capacity because there's a lot of demand, in particular for our Enzyme business and we are building -- we just installed our new fermenters in Hanko in Finland, and there's more to come for the first half of next year, which will help us to decrease logistic costs here as well and fulfill what we get in terms of demand from our customers. We're very optimistic on this one because the technology is superior, and it's certainly a good growth driver for us going forward."

Synergy realization is going actually, on the cost synergies, extremely well. As you have seen, we have already realized $40 million in the first 3 quarters of the $45 million we have promised. So it's very, very likely that we will overachieve. On the sales synergies, we are very much on track. And I see when I visit our facilities, and I was basically out there in the field the last week in Europe, but the teams are working very nicely and very, very well together. So we see that more sales synergies are coming in. And that shows that we are building a very, very strong position for the company going forward. 
In terms of the different categories as well, we see still a good -- and good performance on the Fine Fragrance side, which is very, very helpful.

Of the full year margin guidance, and relative to the freight impact, we have about 200 basis points associated with cost. About 2/3 of that is pure rate and about 1/3 of that or about 60 basis points is related to higher usages of freight, principally air and principally to support our H&B business because of capacity limitations.

And despite the capacity on our manufacturing side, we had some issues with seaweed harvesting, which goes into one of the products of our big customers, which is -- I can give you details on our one-on-one. And the harvesting now is going better because we have new fields in front of Norway, which we are discovering right now and using much to increase our manufacturing on the side.

Rustom will then provide a detailed review of our second quarter financials, highlighting segment level business performance and the market dynamics we saw in the quarter. Before we jump into the question-and-answer session, Rustom will also conclude with an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2021.
Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our business highlights for the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that IFF has delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, which is a robust acceleration versus our combined Q1 growth and through the first half of the year.
As I've said before, execution is everything, and IFF has delivered strong financial results, while advancing our ongoing integration efforts following the completion of the N&B merger in February. In the first half of 2021, IFF achieved $5.6 billion in sales, representing 8% growth or 5% on a currency-neutral base. For comparable purposes and to reflect the portfolio differences between our peers, I want also to highlight that both businesses performed well, with legacy IFF achieving a very strong high single-digit growth rate with nearly 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and legacy N&B growing in mid-single digits.
At the same time, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, with significant headwinds in material cost and supply chain logistics. In the first half, combined EBITDA growth was a solid 6% and a combined EBITDA margin of 22.5%. 
Importantly, our strong free cash flow of $533 million enables IFF to maintain significant financial flexibility, including our efforts to delever. We remain on track to achieve our deleveraging targets of under 3x by year 3 post transaction close, and we improved our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA leverage from 4.3x in the first quarter to 4.2x in the second quarter. Finally, we are also well on track with integrating the N&B business and continue to realize synergies in line with our expectation for the transaction.
As we sharpen the IFF portfolio, we continue to progress on the divestiture of our food preparation business, which we expect to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the divestiture of this non-core business will create a more efficient IFF, with an enhanced ability to grow and innovate across the key business segments. We are committed to ongoing active portfolio management and will continue to seek ways to increase value creation.
Stepping back to reflect on the first half of the year. I'm very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish. We delivered strong sales growth, which is an acceleration versus historical performance for both legacy IFF and legacy N&B, in the midst of a transformational integration as well as a global pandemic. This is a validation of our strategy, motivates our team to continue defining industry expectations as we continue to see the benefits of our expanded product offering and capabilities.
Long-term growth prospects of our business are strong, and we are making investments in capacity, R&D and plant technologies as well as increasing inventory levels and incurring higher logistic costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim, specifically in the N&B business as we maximize our growth opportunities going forward.
As we look to the third quarter and second half of 2021, our objectives are clear: build on this momentum, while executing on our integration plans, allowing IFF to fully leverage our new capabilities and achieve our long-term expectations.
Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that influenced our results for the first half. Despite persisting global challenges and various economic recoveries, we are pleased to report growth in each of our 4 key operating regions. In North America, we achieved growth in all of our business segments, led by a single-digit growth in Scent, Nourish and H&B.
Similar to the first quarter, our Asian markets continue to perform well, achieving a 5% increase in sales led by double-digit growth in India and a mid-single-digit performance in China. While we had anticipated that growth would have been impacted in India due to COVID in the second quarter, the business was resilient and finished higher than we expected, with strong double-digit growth in Q2. 
From a segment perspective, in Asia, strong increases across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses all contributed to this sustained growth in this key region. Latin America, our strongest performing region, we achieved 12% sales growth, driven by double-digit performance in nearly all of IFF's business segments and underpinned by favorable currency movements and the impact in Brazil, Mexico and South Cone all achieved growth in the first half. 
We are particularly pleased to report that our EMEA region has impressively rebounded in the second quarter up to high single digits. We achieved a 2% increase in sales in the first half as COVID-19-related restrictions eased. Our Scent and Nourish business performed particularly well in Q2, both achieving double-digit growth. 
Bearing any newly emerging COVID-19 challenges, we expect this growth to continue through the remainder of the year as global vaccination rates increase, and Western and Central Europe continue to recover.
Now turning to Slide 8. I will provide a more detailed look at our sales performance across IFF's key business segments through the first half of 2021, particularly those that significantly contribute to our overall 8% sales growth or 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis that I mentioned earlier.
We are pleased to report solid growth across all of our 4 core divisions. Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Nourish achieved currency-neutral growth of 6%, driven by a strong performance in flavors, ingredients and food design.
Similar to the first quarter, Scent remains our largest sales driver on a year-to-date basis, achieving 8% in currency-neutral growth led by a strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance.
Our Health & Biosciences business has returned to solid growth in the second quarter following a challenging first quarter, where sales were affected by COVID-19 pressures in Microbial Control and Grain Processing. While Microbial Control continues to be challenged, for the first half, we saw growth in Grain Processing, which showed a recovery in the second quarter as well as Home & Personal Care cultures and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Finally, our Pharma Solutions business also delivered growth to the first half of 2021 against a strong year ago comparison.
On Slide 9, I would like to discuss the underlying dynamics influencing each of our 4 segments in the first half. As I mentioned, we saw broad-based growth in all Nourish categories, led by robust performance in flavors. Despite strong volume and continued cost discipline, higher raw material costs continue to affect margin when compared to the first half of 2020. However, on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA grew about 7%. 
Our Health & Biosciences businesses delivered growth in the first half, led by strong performance in Home & Personal Care and Grain Processing. This growth offsets COVID-19-related pressures in Microbial Control and a strong year ago comparable in health. Higher logistic costs related to capacity and strong demand impacted our margin. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by this performance and expect continued improvement as we move into Q3.
Our leading growth and profitability driver, Scent, achieved an operating EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points and absolute EBITDA grew nearly 20%. This was driven by a strong rebound in Fine Fragrances as retail channels continue to recover, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and double-digit growth in Cosmetic Active. Scent also delivered strong profitability led by higher volumes, favorable mix and higher productivity, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year.
Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, the segment's 1% growth was driven primarily by improvements in industrials. So our margin was significantly challenged due to higher energy costs, lower manufacturing utilization and result in a weather-related raw material shortages. 
Now on Slide 10 and 11, I would like to discuss our continued synergy progress in connection with our merger with N&B. From a revenue synergy perspective, we remain on track to meet our $20 million revenue synergy target this year. Coupled with continued demand and positive feedback from our customers, we are also confident in our ability to meet our 2024 run rate revenue synergy target of approximately $400 million.
I would like to spend a moment highlighting how we realized this significant opportunity and share additional context on some of our recent wins. And only 6 months since completing the merger, we are already seeing strong affirmation in the opportunity before us. Our Home Care segment is a perfect example of how our expanded portfolio and combined capabilities with N&B delivers creative solutions for our customers and creates new opportunities for our business. 
Recently, our Health & Biosciences division saw an opportunity to collaborate with our Scent division, a global Scent's customers expressed a need for enzyme technology and IFF's capabilities across divisions allowed us to deliver an integrated solution and ultimately create a superior dishwashing detergent. 
Together with IFF's leading fragrance capabilities, our enzyme technology ensures fit-for-purpose delivery and performance, which creates a differentiated product for our customers. This opportunity represents more than $5 million in annual sales potential.
At the same time, we're actively working with other customers across our IFF network to develop solutions that require capabilities across our 4 divisions. The food and beverage category, we continue to see demand for plant-based meat alternatives that showcase the best of our expanded portfolio.
For low sugar, low fed yogurt, we are introducing new flavor technologies with improved texture and speed to market, which are key advantages for our customers. Lastly, in our health category, we are developing an integrated solution for fiber gummy that leverages our unmatched scientific and technical expertise, combined with our best-in-class flavor offering.
These are just a few examples of the cross-selling opportunities that we are seeing customers increasingly demand and differentiator for our business over the long term.
We made significant strides in the second quarter from an integration perspective, ramping up our cost synergies from a few million dollars in the first quarter to a total of approximately $15 million on a first half basis. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings program we have implemented in the second quarter, which allowed us to leverage our increased scale to reduce our indirect spend, benefit from various office consolidations and renegotiations and rightsize our organization.
Additionally, because of our operational strength and commitment to the integration process early on, we were all able to accelerate exiting our various transition service agreements with DuPont. I'm very encouraged by the continued progress on this front, and we are on track to deliver at least $45 million cost synergies for the full year and ultimately, our 3-year run rate cost synergy target of $300 million.
And now I will hand it over to Rustom."

In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency-neutral basis, pr",1760,"Thank you, Andreas. I will begin with an overview of our consolidated second quarter results on Slide 12. 
In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and a strong Health & Biosciences performance.
Though our gross margin was pressured by higher input costs, raw materials and logistics inflation, and higher air freight volumes, this was partly offset by our disciplined cost management practices, administrative expense reductions and cost synergies. This enabled us to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $1.50 for the second quarter. 
On Slide 13, I want to provide a perspective on sales performance in Q2 versus pre-COVID. There is no doubt that 2020 was an extraordinary year due to COVID-19, so it makes more sense to also evaluate our performance relative to 2019 levels. And as you can see, all 4 divisions in the second quarter delivered strong sales growth as compared to the space period.
Total company sales were up 8% on a 2-year basis, with double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma Solutions, a high single-digit increase in Scent and mid-single-digit growth in H&B. With the exception of a handful, all of our subcategories have grown relative to their pre-COVID levels. 
Most notably, we are pleased to report that those categories most impacted by COVID-19 are ahead of their respective Q2 2019 levels, including Cosmetic Active, which is up double digits; Fine Fragrance, which is up high single digits; and Grain Processing, which is up low single digits.
Food Service and Microbial Control, while we had strong growth in the second quarter of 2021, remain below Q2 2019 levels, but we expect will continue to improve as we move forward. This performance underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio as well as our position as an essential partner to our customers.
Now on the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the second quarter financials of each of our 4 divisions. Beginning with Nourish on Slide 14. Sales for the division increased by 15% year-over-year or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors, with Frutarom contributing to growth, and a strong ingredients performance, particularly from our protein solutions, cellulosic, locus bean gum and food protection categories. 
Nourish also saw a strong rebound in Food Design, including a very strong 24% growth in Food Service as pandemic-related restrictions continue to ease and consumer behavior in away-from-home channels continue to normalize. As I mentioned in the previous slide, higher raw material costs put relatively modest pressure on the margins of most of our individual segments, although we are pleased to have delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. 
Pricing continued to accelerate in Q2 and contributed over a percent of growth in the second quarter. As we will discuss later, we expect this will increase significantly in the third and fourth quarter as more of our pricing actions take hold.
Turning to Slide 15. Our Health & Biosciences division saw a year-over-year growth of 9% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home and Personal Care. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are particularly encouraged by Health & Biosciences return to growth this quarter, led by our Microbial Control and Grain Processing categories strong recoveries from the industrial and supply chain challenges related to COVID-19.
Performance in our health category was challenged based on the particularly strong double digit probiotics year-over-year comparison, although this did not offset the rest of the segment's growth and we remain confident in the health categories trajectory moving forward.
Health & Biosciences also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5%. While you see that the division's margin was down this quarter, this was due to higher logistics costs in order to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and invest in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year. We are incurring significantly higher airfreight costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim and this is impacting our EBITDA margin.
Now turning to Slide 16 to discuss the results of our Scent division, which continued to be a standout growth contributor this quarter. Our Scent division generated $550 million in total sales, representing year-over-year growth of 16% or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Scent also achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 34% with margin expansion of 300 basis points, driven by robust volume mix and productivity, which did offset some inflationary pressures.
While Consumer Fragrances was down slightly this quarter against a very strong double-digit year-ago comparison, a significant rebound in Fine Fragrances, which grew by approximately 85%, led by new wins and improved volumes, more than offset Consumer Fragrances more modest performance due to last year's double-digit growth.
Our Ingredients category also contributed to the division's strong performance, growing double digits, led by strong performance in Cosmetic Active and Fragrance Ingredients. Overall, we are extremely pleased with Scent's continued strong performance.
Lastly, turning to Slide 17 to discuss Pharma Solutions. Currency-neutral sales were flat against a strong year ago comparison, with industrial Pharma the most significant performance driver for this division, led by Global Specialty Solutions. Core pharma's performance was challenged against a very strong year ago comparison.
On a 2-year basis, growth was solid at about 3.5%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was pressured this quarter, with the margin decline due to higher energy costs and lower manufacturing utilization due to a couple of plant shutdowns as a result of weather-related raw material shortages. Specifically, we had raw material availability issues related to the Midwest storm in the U.S. earlier this year, which meant we were not able to run production and absorb our fixed costs. Going forward, the supply chain is improving which we expect will lead to stronger margins in Pharma Solutions for the balance of the year.
Now turning to Slide 18. I'd like to review our cash flow position, leverage dynamics for the first half of 2021, which remain a top priority as we continue to navigate a recovering global market.
As you will see in the first half, IFF generated $533 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow from operations totaling $698 million, driven by an improvement in core working capital. CapEx for the first half totaled $165 million or approximately 3% of sales as we continue to invest in growth-accretive areas that we believe will ultimately prove rewarding over the long term as well as integration-related activities.
In the first half, we also delivered $274 million in dividends to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we are confident that our cash generation will remain robust, and have announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
From a leverage perspective, our cash and cash equivalents finished at $935 million, with gross debt holding steady at $12 billion. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.61 billion, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.2x.
We are slightly better than we expect to be at this point in time, and we are still expecting to delever to below 3x net debt to EBITDA in the first 3 years post the transaction close.
Now moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2021. IFF has built a solid foundation in the first half of the year and delivered particularly strong second quarter performance, and we expect strong growth will continue through the rest of the year.
For the full year 2021, we are, once again, increasing our forecast for total revenues with an expectation to achieve 2021 total revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, which equates to about 7% growth. This is up from our previous $11.25 billion or 6% growth as we have confidence in our sales momentum continuing into Q3 and through the rest of the year. Breaking down the contributors of growth, we expect currency-neutral sales to be about 5% and FX benefits to be approximately 2%. 
While pandemic-related uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the strong performance and important recoveries we are seeing across the business, which we believe position us well to capture continued strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4. At the same time, we now see full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin at about 22.5% versus approximately 23% previously. A part of this reduction is related to our margin performance in Q2 for all the reasons I explained earlier. We also continue to see inflationary pressures across the supply chain.
From a raw material perspective, we have seen raw material costs continue to increase over the course of the year. In the first half, we are successful in raising our prices to recover a portion of the cost increases and continue to expect close to full cost recovery in the second half.
It should be noted that we're also seeing more broad-based non-raw material inflation, such as higher energy costs that we are managing through. Our expectations for airfreight has also increased significantly as rates are higher, but mostly higher volumes to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We are absorbing higher logistics costs to grow the business in the short term and expect this is only temporary until our capacity expansion projects are complete.
The combination of unfavorable price to raw material costs and higher logistics costs are negatively impacting operating margin in 2021 by more than 100 basis points. However, through higher sales, strong cost discipline and our focus on unlocking additional cost synergies, we believe we will end up only about 50 basis points lower than our previous expectations, with higher revenues and a roughly similar dollar EBITDA level.
For modeling purposes, please note that depreciation and amortization, interest expense, CapEx as a percentage of sales, adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization and weighted average diluted share counts all remain the same as what we shared in Q1.
Overall, we are confident that we are well placed to continue capturing additional growth over the next 2 quarters and beyond, while maintaining our focus on execution, continued financial discipline and leveraging our significantly bolstered resources and expertise as a stronger, more diversified company.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Andreas, who will provide some closing remarks before we open the line for our question-and-answer session."

Before I wrap up today's call, I would like to first recognize our thousands of employees around the world who continue to display their unwavering commitment to serve our customers, unify our teams together with N&B and deliver for our communities. Despite the uncertain environment that we have continued to navigate, IFF's first half and Q2 results showcased the strength of our combined portfolio and our ability to execute our ambitious business objectives. And I'm incredibly proud to lead such a talented and passionate group of IFFers.
We have much to be proud of this quarter as we move ahead. I'm confident that we have built the financial and operational structures needed for our combined company to reach even greater heights. As Rustom and I have mentioned, we are targeting a strong full year performance, indicative of our post-pandemic aspirations, and I know we are exceptionally positioned to achieve this. And we are seeing the strong top line momentum continue in the early days of the third quarter.
Together, we will further our mission to be an innovative force for good and redefine what it means to be a leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And then related to that, was there any borrowing in 2Q from the back half of the year? Is that something that we should listen for, watch for kind of thing? And how do you think about that? And then on pricing, how do you think about the increase in pricing, which seems to be much more around the DB portfolio and thinking about the elasticity there relative to the legacy business?"

So first of all, your second question, there's no borrowing from the third quarter for the second quarter. I think that's important. Number 2 is what is driving us and the strong performance in the second quarter and also the start into the third quarter because July, we had the sales already. So it's a strong win rate. It's a very robust demand we are seeing. In some areas, it is also a superior technology, in particular in parts of the enzyme business and a really good R&D pipeline here as well.
So the question now is why we are not going higher? Look, it's a [indiscernible] environment for us right now. and as for everybody else. So we have now the COVID Delta variant. And we said, ""Look, let's be careful here what we do getting ahead of our skis here and make sure that we have a very realistic target on the sales side.""

But it's probably too early to raise the forecast already for next year. That might be in the next call where we can take a very detailed look.
The most important thing for me is how natural the teams are already combining ingredients at Flavors, for example, and what kind of opportunities we have in areas like the Home Care with superior edition washing detergents, for example, and in the health area as well, which were not so much on our forefront when we started this all endeavor.

Probably close to 80% is impacting Nourish. And it's a few specific areas, it's soy meal, soy protein. That's the biggest one that we see there.
There's LBK, lotus bean kernel that's very close behind. And then there's also like vegetable oils, propylene glycol, stuff like that.

And on the Health & Bioscience piece, it's certainly driven by our manufacturing capacity, which is limited but also with higher comps we will see for the last 2 quarters. So we will see how it goes. We are very careful here on this side. But it will be more positive than what we have seen in the first quarter. Certainly, we saw already an acceleration in the second quarter, and it will go in the right direction.
So we are observing it quite carefully. What I can tell you also in the third quarter, the legacy N&B businesses had a pretty strong start. And then certainly, part of it is in the Nourish business as well and reflected in the Nourish numbers, in particular, the Ingredients business, we should not underestimate that.

I was curious to the degree as you've now gotten further in with the N&B business, if it feels like perhaps that's been a bit underinvested in -- whether it was in the 12 to 15 months prior to deal close or even before that because the need to be investing in CapEx, the call out of higher-than-expected logistics separate from rate, right, but just again, because of these capacity air freight and so on suggests that there's something there.

And we have now adapted our CapEx plan going forward that we can deal with these, let's say, shortages quite nicely over the next, I would say, 15 months. The positive for me is that demand is very robust. And the other positive is that we see some superiority of our products in that market, which is really good.

On -- I would say if I go to the different categories,  we see still strong demand for Fine Fragrances. And this is not just driven by the robust demand right now, but also by our win rate. We are winning more than our fair share, and that's very, very helpful. Consumer Fragrance, here, I would say, in general, for the market, you see a moderation, and that's what you hear in the market from the big CPGs as well. But again, we are in the good position or lucky position that we are on all the core lists we wanted to be.
And then we talked over the last couple of quarters about the street callers we made 1.5 years ago, and they are really contributing. So that's helpful for us. But in general, we see some moderations. 
Another one is Active Cosmetics. We see a big, big and strong growth going forward. On Health & Bioscience, I would say, very strong in Home & Personal Care, but more driven by our wins and our technology than by the whole market. So that's what I would say. And then Grain Processing and Microbial Control are coming back out of, let's say, modest performance in last year. And animal nutrition is pretty good as well.
On the Nourish side, I would say we haven't seen any slowing down of demand. And that might be also driven because we are now in a unique position that we can offer, from the ingredient, to the flavor, to the total solution that we are in a different position than many of our competitors, and that helps us actually to position us in the right way.
So answering your question is we see some markets, we see the market's moderation, but not too much for us because of the position where we're in right now. So that will be my overall comment."

I mean, yes, it came from the February outages, but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, right, with methochloride.

I mean, yes, it came from the February outages, but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, right, with methochloride. And it shut down 2 of our plants temporarily during the period, which meant that it's a pity because we could have sold every single thing we produced, obviously, -- And then we also had underutilization. So that's what came through there. If I was to roughly look at the break in general, at the percentages in general between raw material and freight about, call it, 85% or so of the total comes from raw material increases and about 15% from freight. 
And that's -- but interestingly, freight is a much smaller portion, right? If you break up that 5.5% that we talked about, the material cost impact is probably about 5% inflation we're seeing. I'm rounding all these numbers. And the freight rate increase is probably about 8%. And may even be slightly higher with the way that's going. I mean containers are 3 to 4x, sea freight, as high as they've been. 
And also, there's one more complication even when we have contracted rates we and many others experienced, there's lots of delays going on and stuff. So we sometimes book -- we can't get the stuff on the contracted rate still much later and have to pay spot rates. And we also forced sometimes to look at different modes of transport from a reliability perspective. So lot's going on there."
