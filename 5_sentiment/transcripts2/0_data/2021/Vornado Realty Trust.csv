Before Michael gets into the business review and the numbers, let me make a few comments. 
Notwithstanding that this is a new year, 2021 still feels a lot like 2020. The COVID pandemic remains a significant health risk. Normal life continues to be disrupted. Gatherings and travel are still restricted, and office building occupancy remains quite low. 
But there is light at the end of this long tunnel. Scientists and farmers around the world have worked at warp speed. And with the rollout of various vaccines expected to accelerate in the coming months, we expect New York to begin to rebound, with office workers and tourists returning in the second half. While New York's recovery will take some time, the city remains a magnet for talent, as evidenced by leading companies renewing their leases and making large new space commitments even during the pandemic. 
For all the talk about working from home, I continue to believe that our natural zoom and social inclinations and the pent-up demand to interact, gather and experience all the city has to offer will carry the day. When life returns to normalcy, the many positives of having employees working in the same space together with their colleagues will become self-evident. In the end, I believe that working at home and once kitchen alone, day after day, week after week is not a long-term proposition. 
We have a new administration in Washington which is committed to push through significant additional stimulus, and New York will certainly get its fair share. These dollars and the potential to modify or partially reverse SALT, if that actually were to happen, will greatly benefit New York and other large cities. 
Despite 2020 being one of the most challenging years in our lifetime, we have made significant progress to position Vornado for future growth. In 2020, we closed $1 billion of apartments at 220 Central Park South. That's a big number, which was added to our cash balances and enhanced our financial strength. Remember, we are building Farley and Penn 1 off our balance sheet without debt. In December 2020, the grand new Moynihan train opened to the public to rave reviews, further cementing Penn as the transportation center of New York and our Penn District as the bull's eye. Vornado was honored to be a major participant in the Moynihan public-private partnership. 
In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, we completed our lease with Facebook for all 730,000 square feet of the office portion at Farley. This lease was the largest office lease in New York last year. The first phase of Facebook space was delivered in January and the remainder will be delivered later this year. 
The new Long Island Railroad 33rd Street entrants situated between PENN 1 and PENN 2 also opened in December. Its design is futuristic and unique and exciting, and that is intentional. In December, we finalized our agreement with the MTA to develop the Long Island Railroad Concourse. The retail stores are on the north side of the complex are ours and sit in our PENN 1 footprint. This project will double the width of the concourse, relieve overcrowding, raise the ceiling to a grand 18 feet and create a vastly improved concourse for the hundreds of thousands of commuters who use in each day. Construction is now underway, and our retail has been taken out of service. As part of the deal here, we will gain long-term control of an additional 22,000 square feet of retail on the south side of the concourse. So we now have all the retail along both sides of the heavily trafficked Long Island Railroad Concourse. By the way, in normal times, Penn Station is teeming with traffic, and our retail stores do really, really well here. 
In 2021, we will deliver in phases our redevelopment of the 2.6 million square foot PENN 1. This game-changer will include 200,000 square feet of amenities, the likes of which are unparalleled in New York. We are targeting summer time opening of the 34th Street lobby, with full completion shortly thereafter. Also in this year, our dramatic redevelopment of the 1.8 million square foot PENN 2 will be in full swing. 
Sitting here today, we are more confident than ever in our design and programming of the 4.4 million square foot campus at the combined PENN 1 and PENN 2. With unique and outstanding architectural design and amenities sitting on top of New York's main transportation hub, with Apple and Facebook tenancies in other of our adjacent buildings and with the governor's plan for significant additional investment in the Penn Station area, we couldn't be more excited. 
To showcase our vision for the district, we have just opened our new Penn District Experience Center. Actually, that's a fancy word for sales center. Located on the seventh floor at PENN 1, appropriately in the heart of the action. This 12,000 square foot marketing center is the best I've ever seen. It will be the venue for our leasing and development teams to present and showcase our projects to the brokerage community and prospective tenants. Early comments from brokers and tenants have been amazingly enthusiastic. 
When gatherings are again permitted, we look forward to hosting all of you. In the meantime, please visit our website for the latest images of our plans for the Penn District. 
We update our development yields once a year and have done so for the Penn District on Page 31 of our supplement filed last evening. Overall, the projected yields on these projects has declined modestly from 8.3% to 8.0%. Let me explain. Folly declined 100 basis points, largely from additional TIs we granted Facebook to close the deal during the pandemic. We also are budgeting additional DIs for retailers at Folly, given the environment. It was heroic to close the Facebook lease in the middle of the pandemic, and it is an outstanding deal that we are proud of. Facebook loves Folly, at scale, its location, its architecture and its huge floorplate. At PENN 1, we increased the budget to include the Long Island Railroad Concourse redevelopment, which I just mentioned, as well as 2 sustainability initiatives we have added to the scope at PENN 1. We are replacing all single pane glazing with new state of the art triple pane high energy performance windows, which will dramatically improve energy loss, sound infiltration and tenant comfort. We are also increasing the scope of PENN 1 to include an electrification program to enable the building to access more clean renewable energy. These initiatives should command higher rents. But to be conservative, we haven't adjusted for that in the budget. 
At PENN 2, the returns actually increased as we spud the numbers with respect to expense and tax assumptions. As Farley, PENN 1 and PENN 2 come online, they will deliver very significant incremental earnings. 
As you will notice, we did not publish an NAV estimate this year as we had for the past several years. I foreshadowed this in my shareholders letter last April, as every analyst does their own estimate anyway and the market didn't seem to be placing much value you on ours. 
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we implemented a program to reduce our G&A by $35 million. While difficult, this was the right thing to do. In connection with this, 2 of our below long-tenured executives, David Greenbaum and Joe MacNow, stepped back at year-end from day-to-day roles and became senior advisers. Vordano is indebted to them and thank them for their immense contributions. Glen Weiss and Barry Langer, our long expanding heads of leasing and development, now have leadership roles as co heads of Real Estate. Actually, they have been functioning as co-heads for over a year now and are to David. Michael Franco has taken on the additional role of CFO, succeeding Joe. And Tom Sanelli has been appointed Chief Administrator Officer, stepping up from CFO of the New York Office division, taking on additional responsibilities on our financial division. This is all a continuation of our leadership transition that we began in April 2019. I am confident that our talented next-generation of leaders are seasoned, proven and up to the task. 
A word about ESG. We continue to be industry leader on sustainability. ESG remains our highest priority for all of us at Vornado and is further supported with oversight from our Board. The risks related to climate change are imminent. We are determined to reduce our carbon footprint. We lead by example, to Envision 2030, our 10-year plan to make our buildings carbon neutral, which starts with our commitment to reducing our energy consumption 50% below a 2009 base year. I would note that since 2009, we have achieved a 24% energy reduction over the 10-year period through 2019. We have a seat at the table with climate policymakers at city, state and federal levels to advise not only on what role buildings must play in climate change mitigation, and even more importantly, on how to execute. We've also led with robust disclosure of our ESG data with early adoption of SASB standards release of our EEO data and climate scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures or TCFD. Our 2020 ESG report will be released in tandem with my shareholders later in April. 
I finish with a shout out and a thank you to our amazing and talented Vornado people, to our leasing teams who did the Facebook and NYU deals, which, by the way, were the 2 largest deals in 2020, to our development teams responsible for Farley, PENN 1 and PENN 2, and more, and to our operations teams who follow all protocols and have our buildings sanitized are ready to welcome our tenants home. You are all a plus, at the head of the class, and we say thank you. 
Now to Michael."
312648,691323583,2213654,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I too hope you're all safe and healthy. I'll first cover our financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Fourth quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.66 per share compar",1857,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I too hope you're all safe and healthy. 
I'll first cover our financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. 
Fourth quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.66 per share compared to $0.89 for last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.23. This decrease is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 5 and in our financial supplement on Page 7. It was driven by a few items. Roughly 1/2, which is $0.12 from our variable businesses still being offline; roughly 20%, which is $0.05 from taking Penn district space out of service; and the balance from the JCPenney lease rejection and Manhattan Mall and other tenant issues, offset by some interest savings. None of these items are new news and are right in line with our statements over the past couple of quarters. Furthermore, most of these are temporary, and the income will return over time. 
On January 29, we issued a press release summarizing fourth quarter noncomparable items for both net income and FFO. The biggest item was a $236.3 million noncash impairment loss, relating primarily to wholly owned retail properties as required by GAAP accounting. 
With respect to rent collections, in the fourth quarter, rent collections, excluding deferrals, improved 200 basis points to 95%, driven by a significant pickup in retail collections. The breakdown is we collected 97% of office rents and 88% of retail rents, excluding deferrals. January and February collections are running at the same level. 
While the average headline same-store cash NOI numbers are negative on their face, our core New York office business actually was a positive 1.4%. When you blend in Chicago and San Francisco also, our office business overall was essentially flat at negative 0.4%. The big takeaway here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company, is continuing to perform well in this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. 
Let me also comment on our retail cash basis NOI. If you annualize fourth quarter retail cash basis NOI of $34.3 million, as shown on Page 15 of the supplement, you get $137 million. That's a good run rate number to use for 2021. Please don't consider this guidance. But given the potential NOI leasing of vacant space and the properties under development, we expect this number to grow from here, absent any further tenant bankruptcies. 
Finally, a number of you asked for the breakdown of our previously announced $35 million overhead reduction program by period for modeling purposes. Again, while we do not give guidance, here it is. 2020's G&A, as published yesterday, was $159 million, excluding the onetime costs associated with the overhead reduction program. 2021 G&A is budgeted at $141 million, an $18 million reduction. 2022 will benefit from a further reduction of $9 million, and thereafter, by a reduction of $1.6 million. The total of these reductions is $28.6 million. In addition, there are $6.4 million of reductions budgeted for 2021 that do not flow through G&A from lower operating expenses and capitalized payroll. 
While 2020 was a difficult year, we have planted the seeds for significant growth once the city begins to return to a normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the $35 million overhead reduction program we executed in December, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses and the Farley building fully coming online in 2022, followed by the redeveloped PENN 1 and PENN 2 and reduced interest costs as we roll over our debt. 
Now turning to leasing markets. 2020 office leasing activity and metrics were greatly impacted by the pandemic across all 3 of our markets. Total leasing volume across Manhattan was the lowest since 2000, while new leasing activity was at an all-time record low of 12.3 million square feet. Negative net absorption during the year, driven by sub lease space being put on the market, led to an increase in the overall availability rate. This sublease space will certainly present a near-term challenge to stabilizing net effective rents. 
While tenant rents have come down in a measured way, concessions have spiked, though we believe now have generally stabilized, as landlords are doing what they need to do to be competitive in this environment to fill space. We've seen this movie before though. The market is following the same pattern. We have experience in predicting the downdraft and then the recovery if one is willing to look out a year or 2. 
During 2020, with post COVID leasing activity down dramatically, we still leased 2.2 million square feet and 54 separate leasing transactions in New York. Our initial rents were strong at $89.33 per square foot and average term of these leases was 14.4 years. Mark-to-market was a positive 4.6% cash. And most notably, as Steve mentioned, we executed the 2 largest leases in Manhattan during 2020. This 730,000 square foot Facebook lease at Farley and NYU's long-term renewal of 633,000 square feet at our One Park Avenue. Our 336,000 square foot lease with Apple at PENN 11 and 120,000 square foot lease with Citadel at 350 Park also highlighted a solid leasing year. 
In the fourth quarter, we completed 16 office leases comprised of 163,000 square feet. We signed a new office lease with LVMH for 24,000 square feet at 595 Madison Avenue to go along with their flagship Fendi and Baluta retail leases at the building, further reinforcing its bull's eye location. We also signed 64,000 square feet of deals at PENN 1, including an important 24,000 square foot renewal with Wells Fargo. Initial cash rents for the quarter were $75.55 per square foot and cash mark-to-market was positive 0.5%. We ended the year with New York office occupancy at 93.4%. 
We are feeling more optimistic given what we're seeing in the first 6 weeks of 2021. Tour volume is up. We are seeing more tenant proposals coming into lease space, particularly in the financial services sector. And companies are looking to take advantage of current market conditions. Importantly, as large companies begin to plan for their employees return to the office, they are also beginning to focus on their future lease expirations and interviewing brokers as first steps in the process. We know of at least 4 companies with large space needs and the need to plan ahead, which held interviews during the month of January alone in this regard. 
Additionally, as the initial shock of COVID wears off and companies begin to look forward, most of the paused negotiations in our portfolio are restarting. Notwithstanding some of the positive signs, we anticipate leasing activity will remain slow through the first half of 2021. 
It is obvious that flight to quality is accelerating as tenants not only are seeking the best available product, mainly redeveloped and new construction, but more than ever want to do business with the strongest landlords. We are certainly getting more than our fair share of the deals that are out there. Our leasing team is very active in the market and has their pulse on tenant activity, all of which is reflected in our pipeline, where we have some 300,000 square feet of leases out in negotiation. These include a 55,000 square foot lease with a tech company at 1290 avenue the Americas, a 33,000 square foot lease expansion with a financial services company at 888 7th Avenue and a 75,000 square-foot lease out with a nationally recognized nonprofit at 825 7th Avenue. Beyond this, we have an additional 1 million square feet in discussions, the majority of which is with tenants which would be new to our portfolio. 
As we have said in the past, our office expirations during 2021 and 2022 are very modest, helping us mitigate against more challenging near-term conditions. In each of 2021 and 2022, we have less than 5% of our space rolling, 742,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2021 and 726,000 square feet in 2022, of which 352,000 square feet during that 2-year period is at the newly redeveloped PENN 1. 
Turning now to Chicago and the market. In the Chicago market, new leasing continues to be slow, while short-term renewals are dominating activity. We are, of course, in dialogue with many of our expiring tenants, including a 44,000 square foot renewal, which we expect to be signed in the next few days. 
During 2020, we completed a 10-year renewal through 2032 for 148,000 square feet with PayPal and signed 49 showroom leases comprising 190,000 square feet at very strong starting rents of almost $55 per square foot, including 62 -- 52,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to San Francisco. 505 California Street continues to outperform the market. We recently completed 4 renewal transactions, reflecting the market resiliency of this best-in-class asset and reinforcing its status as the premier building in the city. Impressively, during the period of our 14-year ownership, we have never lost a major tenant in this building. Goldman Sachs renewed its entire 90,000 square foot lease. The mark-to-market on this renewal was 58.7%, while Bank of America committed long-term to the building by tacking on an additional 10 years to their current lease term to bring this expiration to 2035. The bank will consolidate all its San Francisco offices into its existing 247,000 square feet at 505, returning to its original home. This was the largest lease done in San Francisco in 2020. It is important to note we have no leases expiring in San Francisco in 2021 and only 48,000 square feet expiring in 2022, where we are in advanced discussions with these tenants to renew. 
Turning to retail now. The retail environment remains challenging and rents continue to be under pressure. Retailers have little visibility on sales given the uncertainty over timing of and office workers returning, and thus most remain reluctant to commit the new space. But retailers are starting to kick the tires again on space. There also continues to be a flight to quality, with retailers upgrading their locations or accessing high foot traffic locations that were previously unavailable, as evidenced by our lease this quarter with Christophe at 595 Madison, where they will join Fendi and Berluti. Demand for the retail at Farley remains strong, with particular interest in the Food Hall. We have now signed 14 leases and have another 8 out for signature. We ended the year with New York retail occupants [ to ] 78.8%, the decline primarily JCPenney related. 
Turning to capital markets now. The real estate financing markets continue to improve, with spreads tightening back to pre-pandemic levels for high-quality office. All-in coupons are now at historically low levels. We are actively working on a number of refinancings and expect that we will term out these loans at lower rates than the current ones. 
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.91 billion, including $1.73 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

With respect to refinancing the buildings, that's basically a layup there. 555 is extremely underlevered, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of market value or even lower. And so we are gearing up to refinance that now. We are -- it has not yet been decided as to how much we will refinance that building for. But refinancing that building is in process and will not be a problem at all. So"

The first thing I would tell you, we're seeing a very large uptick in our presentations to big tenants coming out of the woodwork thus far this year. We've had 5 different presentations to large headquarter tenants in the last 2 weeks. That's #1. So you're starting to see people come out and start to see things, and the reception has been excellent on our Penn projects and 350 Park, #1. #2, as it relates to tenants' plans, we've been reviewing that in a very focused way. We've seen no change to what tenants were doing pre-pandemic to what we see them doing now during the pandemic for future occupancy. So I do not see a change at all. 
I think the one thing people are focused on is product type, where, as we keep saying quarter-to-quarter, people are more and more focused on the best building as it relates to redevelopments or new builds, and most importantly, even more recently is the landlords that they're going to marry with, as it relates to services, amenities, infrastructure, sustainability, and everything people care about as we work through this cycle. But in terms of your specific questions, we have not seen the change in planning from a space design standpoint."

And then along came Adam Newman and Rework, and he tried to jam it down to 60 square feet per capita, which was his marketing effort. That's why his space was cheaper because you put more heads into the same amount of space. And so both extremes are observed. And so we see it settling in somewhere in between. And we don't see any major change, as Glen said. We were on the phone yesterday with the senior team with, who I think does probably more of this than anybody else. And they confirm what Glen is seeing in the marketplace. So people have already gone to space planning, which is less formal, less rigid than the old fashioned offices lighting the perimeter windows. So the one thing that we are seeing is that there's a reluctance on the people sharing offices or desks with other people. And so that's sort of in a funny way seems to indicate that the concept of hoteling and hot desk is not going to be as popular going forward. So on the whole, there's more activity. And the space planning activity is pretty much the same as it was before all this started."

Now the governor, who is the master builder of our generation, has put footfall -- he loves pet, and he continues it to be the economic and transportation center of the universe. And if you look at his PowerPoint, that slide shows in his last number of state of the state speeches, et cetera, you can see them very vividly. So his program for the West Side is a lots of work in Penn, which are both aesthetic and logistical, including expanding the track capacity at Penn by acquiring and developing the 780 Block, which is the block contiguous to the south. And that is expanding it with 4 tracks, I think it is, also, including the gateway tunnel. I am corrected by my head of development that -- 8 tracks, okay?

Electrification is -- it's actually pretty simple. All buildings are going to go all-electric because of of the carbon footprint in the future. So anyway, I think these things speak for themselves. And we're not boastful. And we are leaders in sustainability. It's very important to us. We take pride in us, and we take pride in it. And the team that does our sustainability is acknowledged to be, I think, probably the best team around. So you're right. But I don't want you to think that this was an afterthought or this was an add-on or a mistake, okay? This was our making sure that the buildings were up to -- totally up the stuff, as good as they could be as tenant friendly as they could be and as carbon friendly as they could be."

The -- if there's a great deal of sublease space in the market with tenants who are willing to take huge discounts, significant discounts to clear the space that obviously affects the entire market. When you have some lease, when you have a tenant subleasing in one of our buildings, that's an interesting thing because if we have term, then we as landlord have no risk. If there's shorter term, the marketability of the sublease space depends upon the new tenant coming in, dealing with us, at which point we have an advantage. So the -- some of these spaces that are building, generally speaking, is an opportunity for us and an advantage to us. But too much sublease in everybody else's buildings where the tenants are prepared to take much lower prices actually distorts the market and hurts the market. We've been through this in every cycle. And the sign of recovery is when the sublease space starts to clear or be taken back because the tenants decide they need the space rather than get rid of it. So the sublease space is something -- you're right to watch it, it's very important. And at times, it's an issue and a challenge. At times, it's an advantage and an opportunity."

Obviously, anything can still happen, but there's nothing we see on the horizon that is going to give rise to some anything material there. So that's the comment of the tenant. 
On the variable businesses, we're generally not expecting that to gear up until the second half of the year. I think it tracks, as Steve said, when do office workers come back, when the tourists come back, that's going to be third, fourth quarter. And so therefore, the garage income, BMS, which are directly related to tenant occupancies in the buildings, flow from that. And so that's going to be in the latter part of the year. Signage, same thing depending on when charging comes back. So that's the second half of the year, and it's a -- it's not a -- all of a sudden, a late switch has turned on and it comes back in.

None of the real high street as we characterize, Fifth Avenue, Times Square rolls in '21, '22. We had a couple of issues at 50 and 40 in terms of bankruptcies, so that's obviously already made its way through the numbers. So that's why in terms of giving you that run rate number, and as you said, there's rent steps. So there's enough things that are coming online, that have built in contractual bumps, that even if there's a few rollouts, which again, are not material in any one particular property, minimal will stay flat before beginning to grow from the lease-up of both the vacancy as well as the underdevelopment properties like Barley, like PENN 1 and ultimately PENN 2."

Before Michael gets into the business review and the numbers, let me make a few comments. 
Notwithstanding that this is a new year, 2021 still feels a lot like 2020. The COVID pandemic remains a significant health risk. Normal life continues to be disrupted. Gatherings and travel are still restricted, and office building occupancy remains quite low.
But there is light at the end of this long tunnel. Scientists and farmers around the world have worked at warp speed. And with the rollout of various vaccines expected to accelerate in the coming months, we expect New York to begin to rebound, with office workers and tourists returning in the second half. While New York's recovery will take some time, the city remains a magnet for talent, as evidenced by leading companies renewing their leases and making large new space commitments even during the pandemic. 
For all the talk about working from home, I continue to believe that our natural zoom and social inclinations and the pent-up demand to interact, gather and experience all the city has to offer will carry the day. When life returns to normalcy, the many positives of having employees working in the same space together with their colleagues will become self-evident. In the end, I believe that working at home and once kitchen alone, day after day, week after week is not a long-term proposition. 
We have a new administration in Washington which is committed to push through significant additional stimulus, and New York will certainly get its fair share. These dollars and the potential to modify or partially reverse SALT, if that actually were to happen, will greatly benefit New York and other large cities. 
Despite 2020 being one of the most challenging years in our lifetime, we have made significant progress to position Vornado for future growth. In 2020, we closed $1 billion of apartments at 220 Central Park South. That's a big number, which was added to our cash balances and enhanced our financial strength. Remember, we are building Farley and Penn 1 off our balance sheet without debt. 
In December 2020, the grand new Moynihan train opened to the public to rave reviews, further cementing Penn as the transportation center of New York and our Penn District as the bull's eye. Vornado was honored to be a major participant in the Moynihan public-private partnership. 
In 2020 at the height of the pandemic, we completed our lease with Facebook for all 730,000 square feet of the office portion at Farley. This lease was the largest office lease in New York last year. The first phase of Facebook space was delivered in January and the remainder will be delivered later this year.
The new Long Island Railroad 33rd Street entrants situated between PENN 1 and PENN2 also opened in December. Its design is futuristic and unique and exciting, and that is intentional. 
In December, we finalized our agreement with the MTA to develop the Long Island Railroad Concourse. The retail stores are on the north side of the complex are ours and sit in our PENN 1 footprint. This project will double the width of the concourse, relieve overcrowding, raise the ceiling to a grand 18 feet and create a vastly improved concourse for the hundreds of thousands of commuters who use in each day. Construction is now underway, and our retail has been taken out of service. 
As part of the deal here, we will gain long-term control of an additional 22,000 square feet of retail on the south side of the concourse. So we now have all the retail along both sides of the heavily trafficked Long Island Railroad Concourse. By the way, in normal times, Penn Station is teeming with traffic, and our retail stores do really, really well here. 
In 2021, we will deliver in phases our redevelopment of the 2.6 million square foot PENN 1. This game-changer will include 200,000 square feet of amenities, the likes of which are unparalleled in New York. We are targeting summer time opening of the 34th Street lobby, with full completion shortly thereafter.
Also in this year, our dramatic redevelopment of the 1.8 million square foot PENN 2 will be in full swing.
Sitting here today, we are more confident than ever in our design and programming of the 4.4 million square foot campus at the combined PENN 1 and PENN 2. 
With unique and outstanding architectural design and amenities sitting on top of New York's main transportation hub, with Apple and Facebook tenancies in other of our adjacent buildings and with the governor's plan for significant additional investment in the Penn Station area, we couldn't be more excited. 
To showcase our vision for the district, we have just opened our new Penn District Experience Center. Actually, that's a fancy word for sales center. Located on the seventh floor at PENN 1, appropriately in the heart of the action. This 12,000 square foot marketing center is the best I've ever seen. It will be the venue for our leasing and development teams to present and showcase our projects to the brokerage community and prospective tenants. Early comments from brokers and tenants have been amazingly enthusiastic. When gatherings are again permitted, we look forward to hosting all of you. In the meantime, please visit our website for the latest images of our plans for the Penn District. 
We update our development yields once a year and have done so for the Penn District on Page 31 of our supplement filed last evening. Overall, the projected yields on these projects has declined modestly from 8.3% to 8.0%. Let me explain. Folly declined 100 basis points, largely from additional TIs we granted Facebook to close the deal during the pandemic. We also are budgeting additional DIs for retailers at Folly, given the environment. It was heroic to close the Facebook lease in the middle of the pandemic, and it is an outstanding deal that we are proud of. Facebook loves Folly, at scale, its location, its architecture and its huge floorplate. 
At PENN 1, we increased the budget to include the Long Island Railroad Concourse redevelopment, which I just mentioned, as well as 2 sustainability initiatives we have added to the scope at PENN 1. We are replacing all single pane glazing with new state of the art triple pane high energy performance windows, which will dramatically improve energy loss, sound infiltration and tenant comfort. We are also increasing the scope of PENN 1 to include an electrification program to enable the building to access more clean renewable energy. These initiatives should command higher rents. But to be conservative, we haven't adjusted for that in the budget. 
At PENN 2, the returns actually increased as we spud the numbers with respect to expense and tax assumptions. As Farley, PENN 1 and PENN 2 come online, they will deliver very significant incremental earnings. 
As you will notice, we did not publish an NAV estimate this year as we had for the past several years. I foreshadowed this in my shareholders letter last April, as every analyst does their own estimate anyway and the market didn't seem to be placing much value on ours. 
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we implemented a program to reduce our G&A by $35 million. While difficult, this was the right thing to do. In connection with this, 2 of our below long-tenured executives, David Greenbaum and Joe MacNow, stepped back at year-end from day-to-day roles and became senior advisers. Vordano is indebted to them and thank them for their immense contributions. 
Glenn Leis and Barry langer, our long expanding heads of leasing and development, now have leadership roles as co heads of Real Estate. Actually, they have been functioning as co-heads for over a year now and are to David. Michael Franco has taken on the additional role of CFO, succeeding Joe. And Tom Sanelli has been appointed Chief Administrator Officer, stepping up from CFO of the New York Office division, taking on additional responsibilities on our financial division. This is all a continuation of our leadership transition that we began in April 2019. I am confident that our talented next-generation of leaders are seasoned, proven and up to the task. 
A word about ESG. We continue to be industry leader on sustainability. ESG remains our highest priority for all of us at Vornado and is further supported with oversight from our Board. The risks related to climate change are imminent. We are determined to reduce our carbon footprint. We lead by example, to Envision 2030, our 10-year plan to make our buildings carbon neutral, which starts with our commitment to reducing our energy consumption 50% below a 2009 base year. I would note that since 2009, we have achieved a 24% energy reduction over the 10-year period through 2019. We have a seat at the table with climate policymakers at city, state and federal levels to advise not only on what role buildings must play in climate change mitigation, and even more importantly, on how to execute. We've also led with robust disclosure of our ESG data with early adoption of SASB standards release of our EEO data and climate scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures or TCFD. Our 2020 ESG report will be released in tandem with my shareholders later in April. 
I finish with a shout out and a thank you to our amazing and talented Vornado people, to our leasing teams who did the Facebook and NYU deals, which, by the way, were the 2 largest deals in 2020, to our development teams responsible for Farley, PENN 1 and PENN 2, and more, and to our operations teams who follow all protocols and have our buildings sanitized are ready to welcome our tenants home. You are all a plus, at the head of the class, and we say thank you. 
Now to Michael."
312648,691323583,2213777,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I too hope you're all safe and healthy. I'll first cover our financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Fourth quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.66 per share compar",1855,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I too hope you're all safe and healthy. 
I'll first cover our financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. 
Fourth quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.66 per share compared to $0.89 for last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.23. This decrease is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 5 and in our financial supplement on Page 7. It was driven by a few items. Roughly 1/2, which is $0.12 from our variable businesses still being offline; roughly 20%, which is $0.05 from taking Penn district space out of service; and the balance from the JCPenney lease rejection and Manhattan Mall and other tenant issues, offset by some interest savings. 
None of these items are new news and are right in line with our statements over the past couple of quarters. Furthermore, most of these are temporary, and the income will return over time. 
On January 29, we issued a press release summarizing fourth quarter noncomparable items for both net income and FFO. The biggest item was a $236.3 million noncash impairment loss, relating primarily to wholly owned retail properties as required by GAAP accounting. 
With respect to rent collections, in the fourth quarter, rent collections, excluding deferrals, improved 200 basis points to 95%, driven by a significant pickup in retail collections. The breakdown is we collected 97% of office rents and 88% of retail rents, excluding deferrals. January and February collections are running at the same level. 
While the average headline same-store cash NOI numbers are negative on their face, our core New York office business actually was a positive 1.4%. When you blend in Chicago and San Francisco also, our office business overall was essentially flat at negative 0.4%. The big takeaway here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company, is continuing to perform well in this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. 
Let me also comment on our retail cash basis NOI. If you annualize fourth quarter retail cash basis NOI of $34.3 million, as shown on Page 15 of the supplement, you get $137 million. That's a good run rate number to use for 2021. Please don't consider this guidance. But given the potential NOI leasing of vacant space and the properties under development, we expect this number to grow from here, absent any further tenant bankruptcies. 
Finally, a number of you asked for the breakdown of our previously announced $35 million overhead reduction program by period for modeling purposes. Again, while we do not give guidance, here it is. 2020's G&A, as published yesterday, was $159 million, excluding the onetime costs associated with the overhead reduction program. 2021 G&A is budgeted at $141 million, an $18 million reduction. 2022 will benefit from a further reduction of $9 million, and thereafter, by a reduction of $1.6 million. The total of these reductions is $28.6 million. In addition, there are $6.4 million of reductions budgeted for 2021 that do not flow through G&A from lower operating expenses and capitalized payroll. 
While 2020 was a difficult year, we have planted the seeds for significant growth once the city begins to return to a normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the $35 million overhead reduction program we executed in December, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses and the Farley building fully coming online in 2022, followed by the redeveloped PENN 1 and PENN 2 and reduced interest costs as we roll over our debt. 
Now turning to leasing markets. 2020 office leasing activity and metrics were greatly impacted by the pandemic across all 3 of our markets. Total leasing volume across Manhattan was the lowest since 2000, while new leasing activity was at an all-time record low of 12.3 million square feet. Negative net absorption during the year, driven by sub lease space being put on the market, led to an increase in the overall availability rate. This sublease space will certainly present a near-term challenge to stabilizing net effective rents. 
While tenant rents have come down in a measured way, concessions have spiked, though we believe now have generally stabilized, as landlords are doing what they need to do to be competitive in this environment to fill space. We've seen this movie before though. The market is following the same pattern. We have experience in predicting the downdraft and then the recovery if one is willing to look out a year or 2. 
During 2020, with post COVID leasing activity down dramatically, we still leased 2.2 million square feet and 54 separate leasing transactions in New York. Our initial rents were strong at $89.33 per square foot and average term of these leases was 14.4 years. Mark-to-market was a positive 4.6% cash. And most notably, as Steve mentioned, we executed the 2 largest leases in Manhattan during 2020. This 730,000 square foot Facebook lease at Farley and NYU's long-term renewal of 633,000 square feet at our One Park Avenue. Our 336,000 square foot lease with Apple at PENN 11 and 120,000 square foot lease with Citadel at 350 Park also highlighted a solid leasing year. 
In the fourth quarter, we completed 16 office leases comprised of 163,000 square feet. We signed a new office lease with LVMH for 24,000 square feet at 595 Madison Avenue to go along with their flagship Fendi and Berluti retail leases at the building, further reinforcing its bull's eye location. We also signed 64,000 square feet of deals at PENN 1, including an important 24,000 square foot renewal with Wells Fargo. Initial cash rents for the quarter were $75.55 per square foot and cash mark-to-market was positive 0.5%. We ended the year with New York office occupancy at 93.4%. 
We are feeling more optimistic given what we're seeing in the first 6 weeks of 2021. Tour volume is up. We are seeing more tenant proposals coming into lease space, particularly in the financial services sector. And companies are looking to take advantage of current market conditions. Importantly, as large companies begin to plan for their employees return to the office, they are also beginning to focus on their future lease expirations and interviewing brokers as first steps in the process. We know of at least 4 companies with large space needs and the need to plan ahead, which held interviews during the month of January alone in this regard. 
Additionally, as the initial shock of COVID wears off and companies begin to look forward, most of the paused negotiations in our portfolio are restarting. Notwithstanding some of the positive signs, we anticipate leasing activity will remain slow through the first half of 2021. 
It is obvious that flight to quality is accelerating as tenants not only are seeking the best available product, mainly redeveloped and new construction, but more than ever want to do business with the strongest landlords. We are certainly getting more than our fair share of the deals that are out there. 
Our leasing team is very active in the market and has their pulse on tenant activity, all of which is reflected in our pipeline, where we have some 300,000 square feet of leases out in negotiation. These include a 55,000 square foot lease with a tech company at 1290 avenue the Americas, a 33,000 square foot lease expansion with a financial services company at 888 7th Avenue and a 75,000 square-foot lease out with a nationally recognized nonprofit at 825 7th Avenue. Beyond this, we have an additional 1 million square feet in discussions, the majority of which is with tenants which would be new to our portfolio. 
As we have said in the past, our office expirations during 2021 and 2022 are very modest, helping us mitigate against more challenging near-term conditions. In each of 2021 and 2022, we have less than 5% of our space rolling, 742,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2021 and 726,000 square feet in 2022, of which 352,000 square feet during that 2-year period is at the newly redeveloped PENN 1. 
Turning now to Chicago and the market. In the Chicago market, new leasing continues to be slow, while short-term renewals are dominating activity. We are, of course, in dialogue with many of our expiring tenants, including a 44,000 square foot renewal, which we expect to be signed in the next few days. 
During 2020, we completed a 10-year renewal through 2032 for 148,000 square feet with PayPal and signed 49 showroom leases comprising 190,000 square feet at very strong starting rents of almost $55 per square foot, including 62 -- 52,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to San Francisco. 505 California Street continues to outperform the market. We recently completed 4 renewal transactions, reflecting the market resiliency of this best-in-class asset and reinforcing its status as the premier building in the city. Impressively, during the period of our 14-year ownership, we have never lost a major tenant in this building. Goldman Sachs renewed its entire 90,000 square foot lease. 
The mark-to-market on this renewal was 58.7%, while Bank of America committed long-term to the building by tacking on an additional 10 years to their current lease term to bring this expiration to 2035. The bank will consolidate all its San Francisco offices into its existing 247,000 square feet at 555, returning to its original home. This was the largest lease done in San Francisco in 2020. It is important to note we have no leases expiring in San Francisco in 2021 and only 48,000 square feet expiring in 2022, where we are in advanced discussions with these tenants to renew. 
Turning to retail now. The retail environment remains challenging and rents continue to be under pressure. Retailers have little visibility on sales given the uncertainty over timing of and office workers returning, and thus most remain reluctant to commit the new space. But retailers are starting to kick the tires again on space. There also continues to be a flight to quality, with retailers upgrading their locations or accessing high foot traffic locations that were previously unavailable, as evidenced by our lease this quarter with Christophe at 595 Madison, where they will join Fendi and Berluti. Demand for the retail at Farley remains strong, with particular interest in the Food Hall. We have now signed 14 leases and have another 8 out for signature. We ended the year with New York retail occupants at 78.8%, the decline primarily JCPenney related. 
Turning to capital markets now. The real estate financing markets continue to improve, with spreads tightening back to pre-pandemic levels for high-quality office. All-in coupons are now at historically low levels. We are actively working on a number of refinancings and expect that we will term out these loans at lower rates than the current ones. 
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.91 billion, including $1.73 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

And I guess my follow-up, Michael, you sort of talked about a number of tenants in the market today. Maybe you or Glen could just sort of speak to -- I guess what I'm really looking for is space planning. How companies are thinking about densities? And particularly for new deals, which I think give everybody a blank slate to think about their footprint. What are you seeing from tenants today that are looking at new space? How are they configuring it? What do the densities look like? And what does that portend for rollovers on other deals moving forward?"

The first thing I would tell you, we're seeing a very large uptick in our presentations to big tenants coming out of the woodwork thus far this year. We've had 5 different presentations to large headquarter tenants in the last 2 weeks. That's #1. So you're starting to see people come out and start to see things, and the reception has been excellent on our Penn projects and 350 Park, #1. #2, as it relates to tenants' plans, we've been reviewing that in a very focused way. We've seen no change to what tenants were doing pre-pandemic to what we see them doing now during the pandemic for future occupancy. So I do not see a change at all. 
I think the one thing people are focused on is product type, where, as we keep saying quarter-to-quarter, people are more and more focused on the best building as it relates to redevelopments or new builds, and most importantly, even more recently is the landlords that they're going to marry with, as it relates to services, amenities, infrastructure, sustainability, and everything people care about as we work through this cycle. But in terms of your specific questions, we have not seen the change in planning from a space design standpoint."

And then along came Adam Newman and Rework, and he tried to jam it down to 60 square feet per capita, which was his marketing effort. That's why his space was cheaper because you put more heads into the same amount of space. And so both extremes are observed. And so we see it settling in somewhere in between. And we don't see any major change, as Glen said. We were on the phone yesterday with the senior team with, who I think does probably more of this than anybody else. And they confirm what Glen is seeing in the marketplace. So people have already gone to space planning, which is less formal, less rigid than the old fashioned offices lighting the perimeter windows. So the one thing that we are seeing is that there's a reluctance on the people sharing offices or desks with other people. And so that's sort of in a funny way seems to indicate that the concept of hoteling and hot desk is not going to be as popular going forward. So on the whole, there's more activity. And the space planning activity is pretty much the same as it was before all this started."

So we are expecting lots of government assistance to be supported by the new political regimes, including the majority leader who is all powerful. So there's that. Now the governor, who is the master builder of our generation, has put footfall -- he loves pet, and he continues it to be the economic and transportation center of the universe. And if you look at his PowerPoint, that slide shows in his last number of state of the state speeches, et cetera, you can see them very vividly. So his program for the West Side is lots of work in PENN, which are both aesthetic and logistical, including expanding the track capacity at PENN by acquiring and developing the 780 Block, which is the block contiguous to the south. And that is expanding it with 4 tracks, I think it is, also, including the gateway tunnel. I am corrected by my head of development that -- 8 tracks, okay? 
How are they going to fit 8 tracks in that space?"

So we're pretty enthusiastic about all this, I would say, very enthusiastic. Obviously, we think we have the bull's eye location. So we couldn't be more excited about all that. 
Now the one unknown was the campaign promises that they would reverse the Trump tax bill. The major portion of which was reversing SALT,. or if not reversing SALT, significantly modifying that. I mean while sort of -- I think that's very good for New York residents and the big city residents. I don't think that's as big as slam dunk as the stimulus dollars that will come in.

I have no real answer for that, okay? We decided as we went along and planning the building that we wanted to put in the triple play. I think the triple pane glazing is the first in New York. Is it not? 
So it's the first of this -- by the way, it's all over Europe. It's almost mandatory in Europe. It is nowhere in the United States or in New York. We are the first ones to do it here. We spent a great deal of time. And so by saying we want to do it here is sort of a radical thing to do. It's not done in New York construction and development. 
So we spent a great deal of time researching it. We mocked it up. We did everything. And we decided that it was worth the uptick in the dollars in the budget to bring the building into the 21st and 22nd century in terms of its glazing, so we did it, okay? Electrification is -- it's actually pretty simple. All buildings are going to go all-electric because of of the carbon footprint in the future. So anyway, I think these things speak for themselves.

The -- if there's a great deal of sublease space in the market with tenants who are willing to take huge discounts, significant discounts to clear the space that obviously affects the entire market. When you have some lease, when you have a tenant subleasing in one of our buildings, that's an interesting thing because if we have term, then we as landlord have no risk. If there's shorter term, the marketability of the sublease space depends upon the new tenant coming in, dealing with us, at which point we have an advantage. So the -- some of these spaces that are building, generally speaking, is an opportunity for us and an advantage to us. But too much sublease in everybody else's buildings where the tenants are prepared to take much lower prices actually distorts the market and hurts the market. 
We've been through this in every cycle. And the sign of recovery is when the sublease space starts to clear or be taken back because the tenants decide they need the space rather than get rid of it. So the sublease space is something -- you're right to watch it, it's very important. And at times, it's an issue and a challenge. At times, it's an advantage and an opportunity."

Obviously, anything can still happen, but there's nothing we see on the horizon that is going to give rise to some anything material there. So that's the comment of the tenant. 
On the variable businesses, we're generally not expecting that to gear up until the second half of the year. I think it tracks, as Steve said, when do office workers come back, when the tourists come back, that's going to be third, fourth quarter. And so therefore, the garage income, BMS, which are directly related to tenant occupancies in the buildings, flow from that. And so that's going to be in the latter part of the year. Signage, same thing depending on when charging comes back. So that's the second half of the year, and it's a -- it's not a -- all of a sudden, a late switch has turned on and it comes back in.

The decision to permanently close the Hotel Pennsylvania will allow us to get this site ready for development in less than 2 years from now, which is perfect timing for the next phase of our Penn District mega project. I believe that the Hotel Penn site will be the best development site in town. Notwithstanding that we will be delivering for tenants the most robust and unique amenitized offering in the city, with the ADAS convenience of being directly on top of New York's main transportation hub, our strategy here is to price PENN1 and PENN2 below our neighbors to the West under their price umbrella. Since we are coming off $60 rents, this will be an outstanding outcome. Over time, as we continue to remake the Penn District, I fully expect rents will aggressively rise to the premium that they deserve. 
Over the summer and into the early fall, we will be reopening and returning goal. All of our tenants are telling us that they are anxious to bring their employees back to the office, and we are anxious to welcome them back. We remain strong in our belief that working from the office will be the preferred mode of work for companies and their employees post-pandemic. The kitchen table may be a place for some, but I continue to believe the urban office is the workplace of the future. 
As I have said, I believe we will come out of this difficult year in an economic boom, fueled by a tsunami of government stimulus, of which New York is a very major beneficiary. The financial sector is now booming. Tech is now booming. Health care is now booming. Retailers like Walmart, Target and Home Depot are now booming, and there is enormous pent-up demand from consumers eager to travel, meaning tourists returning to New York and spend on all manner of goods and services. This is beginning to happen all across the country. 
Importantly, the major tech companies are telling us that they intend to continue growing their office footprints in New York, and that looks deep and diverse talent pool is unrivaled anywhere. As you can tell, we are very bullish on New York. 
Finally, a word about ESG. We filed our 2020 ESG report on Form 8-K in April -- on April 12. We continue to demonstrate our leadership here, and we're proud of the many awards and recognitions we have received. This is an important topic that we believe it. Please do take a look at this important report. 
Now over to Michael for comment on our numbers and our businesses."

I too hope you're all safe and healthy and look forward to seeing you again in person soon. Let me start with our first quarter financial results, and I'll end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. 
First quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.65 per share compared to $0.77 for last year's first quarter. A decrease of $0.12, primarily due to the effects of the COVID shutdown. One change you will note is that the Hotel Pennsylvania results removed to noncomparable given our decision to permanently close the hotel. The decrease this quarter is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 4 and in our financial supplement on Page 6 and was driven by the following items: $0.04 of our businesses, trade show, signage, garages and BMS still being offline; $0.07 from tenant vacancies and bad debts, primarily the JCPenney and New York & Company lease rejections last year; $0.03 from Penn District space taken out of service; lease cancellation income in last year's first quarter, partially offset by $0.05 from G&A and interest savings. These items are not new news and are right in line with our statements over the past few quarters. Most of these are temporary, and the income will return over time. 
Furthermore, the first quarter results are consistent with the sequential fourth quarter run rate we discussed last quarter, adjusted for the accelerated vesting of equity awards, for retirement age executives in the first quarter. 
With respect to rent collections in the first quarter, overall rent collections were 96%, a continued improvement from the prior quarters. We collected 97% of office rents and 90% of retail rents. April collections ran at the same level. 
While the aggregate headline same-store cash NOI numbers for the first quarter are negative on their face, excluding the variable businesses, our core New York office business actually was positive 3.9%. Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was a positive 1.9%. The big takeaway here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company is continuing to hold on this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. And while the retail same-store numbers are down, overall retail NOI is flat quarter-over-quarter, again, consistent with our recent guidance. 
Finally, we have planned to seeds for significant growth as the pandemic recedes and the city returns normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the previously announced overhead reduction program, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses. From the Farley Buildings fully coming online in 2022, followed by the delivery of PENN1 and PENN2, and reduced interest costs as we roll over our debt. One of the analysts even predicted the Vornado will have the highest growth rate in our sector over the next several years. 
Now turning to leasing markets. We are seeing improved conditions in the office leasing market with the pace of activity up nicely in the past 60 days. The phones are rinning, tour volume is up, proposals are coming in and leases are being signed with the flight to quality trend accelerating. According to the brokerage houses, leasing volume is certainly up versus 2020 numbers. The first quarter had the most activity of any since the fourth quarter of 2019, with most of the actions occurring in Midtown. At the same time, we are realistic and recognized that availability across all submarkets remains high. But an encouraging sign, sublease space has recently come down some. Almost 600,000 square feet of sublease space has been removed from the market by occupiers who plan to reoccupy the space. Moreover, a substantial portion of the sublease inventory is challenged space, either physically, by way of the over tenant having poor credit quality or turn constrained, roughly 1/4 of the sublease space in the market today has less than 3 years of terminal. 
During the first quarter, we completed 12 office leases totaling 208,000 square feet. The 2 largest leases of the quarter were both new to our portfolio. Young build institute for 74,000 square feet, 825 7th Avenue for the new state-of-the-art schooling facility; and Fubotv, Inc. a new world content streaming platform coming off their successful IPO launch for 55,000 square feet in the base of 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Both of these leases represented expansions from their prior locations. 
We are currently negotiating paper on 300,000 square feet, of which 200,000 square feet is with new tenants. And in addition, we have a growing pipeline of 1.4 million square feet, which is up meaningfully from recent quarters. 
Last year, we completed the 2 largest leases in the year, Facebook and NYU. The current sweet spot for deal-making in the market is with small to midsized firms looking to relocate into new or redeveloped assets. Remember, all of our space is redeveloped or in the Penn District, which is under redevelopment. This dynamic matches up well with our current bake, where our largest available blocks are only 180,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street and 117,000 square feet at share at 85 10th Avenue. 
As a reminder, our office expirations in 2021 and 2022 are very modest, with less than 5% of our space rolling each year, and a portion of this in PENN1. Our leasing team is now in full stride in the Penn District with multiple presentations, tours and meetings each day with brokers and tenants across all industry types. Using our new Penn District Experience center to showcase PENN1, PENN2 and our grand plans for the Penn District really brings everything to life. The reception to our vision for the district and our best market differentiated project offerings has been nothing short of now. 
Turning now to Chicago and San Francisco. In Chicago, we are also seeing more activity at the market. During the first quarter, we completed 85,000 square feet of leases including a 45,000 square foot office renewal, along with 18 showroom transactions totaling 40,000 square feet, of which 15 were renewals. We currently have a 90,000 square foot renewal lease in negotiation. And a pipeline of 500,000 square feet showing real interest in the property. Importantly, we will be restarting the trade show business in October this year with the Neocon show, beginning to bring back that income stream. 
In San Francisco, 555 California continues to be in a league of its own. Coming off the heels of our recent large renewals with both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. In April, we executed a lease renewal with KKR and in the triple digits for its 50,000 square feet in the tower. Our occupancy here is 98% with minimal expirations until 2023. 
Turning to retail now. Retail leasing in New York City is beginning to come out of a period of inactivity to a phase of retailers who are succeeding and even pending are now looking for opportunities. All current leasing activity is very price driven. The tourists driven higher rent markets of Fifth Avenue and Times Square have seen the least activity as retailers remain on pause until there is visibility and when the 60-plus million tourists will return. 
During the quarter, we completed 11 retail leases for 46,000 square feet. These included 2 long-term renewals at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, including a lease with JPMorgan Chase for a flagship branch, and a 7-year extension with the luxury retailer todds at 650 Madison Avenue. Our leasing also included another 6 leases assigned at the Farley Concourse, where demand remains strong, and we are in negotiations with tenants to fill the balance of the concourse space. Overall, we are upbeat about the future of our markets, our leading position in them and our prospects for creating value. 
Turning to the capital markets now. First, let me congratulate Jan La Chapel on her promotion Executive Vice President, Head of Capital Markets. 
The real estate financing markets continue to improve with both the CMBS market-wide open and banks beginning to lend again a high quality office. Spreads in all-in coupons are at very attractive levels, as evidenced by our recent strong refinancings of One Park and 909 Third Avenue, both of which were at significantly reduced rates. 
The unsecured market for real estate companies also continues to be very strong, and it is likely that we may shift over time to a more balanced approach between unsecured and secured debt. 
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.94 billion, including $1.76 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end other than that, I don't think it would be premature to get into any details. But I'll give you a little bit of what our thinking is. And by the way, attracting stock is something that has been used very successfully by folks like John Malone at Liberty and [indiscernible] and Barry Diller and for example. And generally, what it's used is when you have a business inside of your core, which is different, and which has a different rate of growth and different characteristics. And so we feel that the Penn District mega project that we have is different than our core assets. And so we feel that investors would benefit enormously by being able to invest in the Penn District and its characteristics. By the way, we do remember it's a development company for better of worse and our core assets. 
So the differentiating aspects of the Penn District is at what we consider to be the epicenter of the New York. It's directly on top of the major transportation hub, which means all of the subways at all of the railroads, all of them come into that hub. And that's an extraordinary statement because you can get in and out of Penn station no matter where you are in the New York City region on one ride. The most important part of it is -- and by the way, it's enormous. When you look at the number of assets and the scale of the assets and the number of blocks that we accomplish is pretty much is enormous. The most interesting part of it, I think from my point of view, and Glen's point of view is it's a cluster of buildings that are interconnected generally underground. So what that means is that a tenant who has a 300,000 square foot required, and have written about this, who goes into a 500,000 square-foot building is locked in, there's no place to go. But a 300,000 square foot tenant in our 5 million growing to 10 million growing to 15 million square foot complex has enormous opportunities to grow should they want in the same building or in adjacent buildings. So I believe that a strategy, which involves a cluster of buildings in a campus, which also will allow for an enormous series of amenities that somebody who has even a giant million foot builder can't afford to do makes us totally unique. 
We're seeing very much the same thing down in Northern Virginia, where our Spinco, JBG Smith, has this enormous concentration of buildings and land, et cetera, in the Crystal City Complex that Vornado contributed to that company when we did the spin in 2015, we've now attracted Amazon HQ2 there, mainly because of the concentration of assets that we have. And obviously, because it's a great labor market. The same is true of our New York -- Penn District. So what we're trying to do and the objective is to take businesses which are different, meaning the Penn District is different than a corolis building on even Park Avenue. And allow investors to have the choice. 
So we're very excited about it. It's a very important work in process, and more details will be coming as we as we advance it and when we announce it. I think somebody said in their reports last night that it was not well received by investors, which is troublesome to me. Because that's totally contrary to my feelings about it and our company feelings about it. And so if that's the case, then we have some work to do to talk to our investors and make everybody understands exactly what we're thinking about. But we couldn't be more excited. And I think that's it for now."

It's obviously a candidate for a teardown and rebuild. But in teardown and rebuild is a combination, and we can grow the site 2, by the way, that speculated in the press. So we could grow in some more than a 200 million square foot building. If we wanted to just focus on our own time without growing it, which will be a million swap we're building. So that is an immense financial undertaking, which would require get record rents, which we have talked several tenants about. And we may do that, but the likelihood is we will not do that. The more likely outcome is that we will wrap up the existing 350 Park Avenue at a very favorable rent and sort of like POS on it for a cycle have and retain the option of doing a new build on it or continuing to rent the existing building over time.

The only thing that I'm uncomfortable about talking about is that the consensus feeling amongst almost everybody. So consensus is something to be concerned about. Normally, I'd like to be on the other side of that, but it is the consensus, and that is also what I believe. And I think it's happening. If you go to other places around the country, which have not been as shut down as New York. It's happening now. You go to Texas, et cetera, where they have different, but where they have been more lenient in the restrictions. 
You can't -- you go into a target store and the shelves are empty. You go into some of the luxury retailers across the country and the shelves are empty. The demand is amazing. They can't build enough houses, et cetera. So I think that's pretty clear. 
The Biden's policies, together with the fact that the majority leader of the Senate is from New York, there is a significant and fair, by the way, in terms of when you look at distribution of these programs across the nation. There is a significant amount of benefit -- financial benefit that's coming to New York in terms of the stimulus package. First, in terms of closing the budget deficits for the city state, which is a universal program across the country, but it's good that we're getting in, and other benefits to our population. So we think that the stimulus will be an enormous benefit to New York, and I think that's proving out. 
With respect to the mayor race, that's a different fish. The auditing about politics in New York is that more than 2/3 -- more than 75% of the registered voters are Democrat in the city. And so therefore, the mayor race is not the election, it's the primary, so almost invariably. Whoever wins the Democrat primary is elected mayor in the general election. There are -- is double-digit number of candidates. Interestingly, there's really no candidate, which has a defining lead. We also have ranked choice voting for the first time, so nobody really quite knows how that works. So the first -- the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates are certainly all in the race. 
I'm hopeful that the candidates will all believe in a couple of principles that I think we believe is. First, that the quality of life is if not the single biggest issue, the biggest issue, and that is safe streets clean Street, for example, the home of the situation has to be handled. And so quality of life issues are very important that they're #1 on my list. On my list, the second is that we need to be a growing city with growing -- with employment growing, which I think everybody subscribes to, which means we have to be a business-friendly city. And so every once in a while, we have plugged on that. The Amazon disaster a couple of years ago in Long Island city is probably the #1 example of that. So quality of life, safe cities, the homeless situation, being business-friendly are my -- the #1 and 2. We then have income in a quality ratio with the quality we have to be a fair city. And so those are the major issues, I think, in the campaign. And I believe that the 3 or 4 candidates who are -- look like they have the best chance of being elected are all well-qualified with respect to that. 
I think one of the very interesting things about elections is that this is a time when the political leadership or the political aspirates actually listen to the population. And I think that the message that I just said, and I think is the universal message that's going from the voters to the politicians. It may be -- some groups of voters may say, income into quality and ratio where the quality is more important. Others may say business-friendly and quality of life. But those 4 major points are the issues, I think, in our city at every other great city, probably in the world right at.  And I'm very hopeful that we will get a may or 1 of the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates that will be well-qualified in that regard."

We are, as they say, loaded up on New York, and we think we like our position. I am disappointed that there has not been in this period, unique opportunities to add value by buying distress, which is something that we have been able to do in past cycles. But that's not the way this has worked out. So this has kind of been a weird period. We've gone through a recession, a COVID-caused recession. It really didn't hurt our main businesses, in terms of our occupancies, but it did nick our income by $200 million because certain of our businesses were shut down like spinach and garages, et cetera. 
On the other hand, interest -- and the other benefit of that is interest rates are historically low, chronically low. It looks like they're going to be low forever, which is something I think we have to be a little bit thoughtful about before we subscribe to that. But there really hasn't been very much in terms of distress that we've been able to buy, although we've been looking very hard. So I'm disappointed in that, but what is, is. I do believe that the best opportunity that we have for capital in our business, by far and away, is investing in the Penn District, which I think if one has a 5- and even a 10-year view, is going to be one of the -- one of the great investments and one of the great developments out there.

There is a -- and by the way, this is a very difficult cycle because, in addition to everything else, we have the secular change from brick-and-mortar retailer to internet shopping, which is a secular change, which sort of makes this cycle much deeper. Nonetheless, it's the cycle. So there's lots of vacancies. 
The first thing that happens is that the vacancies are scooped up by a group of tenants who realize the value and who have business models that can operate and thrive with reasonable rents. When the vacancy starts to get to be absorbed, the rents rise. And during the whole process, the highest quality space demand -- commands the highest rents and the highest demand. So that's beginning to happen now. And as Haim said a few moments ago, the retailers that have thrived are beginning to recognize that this is the bottom and are beginning to recognize that they want to add and even in New York aggressively add at this price point, the unique, important scarce site. So an example the that is that we did a deal with Fendi on Madison Avenue 57th Street recently. We extended a lease with pods on Madison Avenue and 60th Street recently. And there's multiple other examples of that. So what's going to happen is, I wouldn't focus on the spot rent today, that's meaningless. That's the rent that is -- that rent will disappear in a year. And so what's happening is the smart players, the players who have a business model that works are beginning to absorb the good space and that will cause the market to shift. And in a year or 18 months or so, you'll see a totally different market. And in 3 years from now, you'll see a monumentally different market, which will be thriving with much higher rents."

So for example, gaming is an",661,"That's an unanswerable question. The reason I put that in there was, I think that our shareholders have a -- would like to know some of the things that are parking below the surface, even though they may not be that imminent. So for example, gaming is an interesting thing. There are -- everybody that follows New York knows that there are 3 gaming licenses that are yet to be issued in the New York, enabling legislation and that they are targeted for down state. And there's been a fair amount of news about that recently, where some people who are following not our company, but following the basic ebb and flow of stuff in New York knows about this. 
Now those 3 licenses are scheduled to be released in 2023, but there has been a great deal of speculation and press that, that may be accelerated earlier because of the budget deficits, et cetera. The urgency may be offset a little bit because the general governments close those deficits, but who knows. So we have probably the largest portfolio, and we have been receiving multiple incomings from the gaming industry operators who will be applying for those licenses and competing for those licenses. And so the inquiries that we have gotten have been for Manhattan properties. And it turns out that if consensus that our potential assets are probably the best. We have multiple assets, and they're probably the best suited for this kind of activity. 
So now, I mean, we have -- we realize that there is in the enabling legislation, which we've passed 4, 5 or 6 years ago, there's a prohibition against gaming in Manhattan. So that's sort of a disconnect. Why are the operators coming in, in multiple inquiries about our assets when there's a prohibition? So the market is sort of saying, well, maybe that prohibition doesn't make a lot of sense, et cetera. So when you think about it, there's going to be 3 licenses issued. It does make sense that one would be to the east of the Long Island region. One would be to the Westchester region, and then there is the third. Well, and as I wrote about this, fairly short was it doesn't make a lot of sense for that third license the issue in direct competition, the one on Long Island or one Westchester, but that reads Manhattan, which may be the gold that gos in terms of getting revenue for our school systems and what have you. So it's impossible to predict how this comes out. We have multiple assets that are of high interest to these folks. This is a complicated political process. And all I can say is we're dissatisfying incoming interest. And we'll see where that goes. But you can discount that to 0 in your spreadsheet. Although if it did happen, it would be financially interesting. We have no, no, no interest in being a gaming industry or being an operator or anything like that. We are a real estate vendor. That's what we do. 
With respect to the sound space business, it's exactly the same story. We are a real estate vendor. We are not going Hollywood. Although I think some of us would like to have a big part somewhere, whatever. And we are responding to incomings from an industry, which is a streaming industry, which is unbelievably hot. They have a quick deal of interest in being in Manhattan because that's where the talent is. So these are nascent ideas, which I put into the letter because I think our shareholders are entitled to know some of the things that are going on in the background. These will undoubtedly not become large parts of our business, but who knows. 
Just remember, I said, you can look at -- the appendix, it could be Hollywood, Hollywood East. It won't, for sure, but it's an interesting thing that sort of franchise about."

Now I agree with you that the folks in various governments. By the way, the price may come out of Washington in terms of taxation, may be a second runner here. But the point of it is, is that the loss of some very high orders who are at retirement age, by the way, is something that is happening. It's happening all around the country. It's more -- it's happening more aggressively in California, by the way. And California folks they flee to Texas, and New York folks in Florida. What I'm saying basically is the backbone of New York is not the 20 or 30 hedge funds -- trillion-airs or billion-airs who are going to Florida or wherever. The backbone of New York is the $300,000, $500,000, even $1 million earning management people in their prime in their 40s who are raising families, et cetera, whose jobs who are not the heads of their businesses and can live anywhere, whose jobs and future. It depends upon being in New York, where they can do 3x better than they can do anywhere else. As 
long as that -- as long as that holds, New York will be fine. And as we see it, people like JPMorgan Chase building, they do headquarters building, et cetera. The businesses that are -- I'm not talking about the entrepreneurs who can live anywhere. And there are a very small number of people, although they're very exponentially important. The mass of the talent that New York has pretty much is staying in New York, has to stay in New York wants to stay in New York, love to stay -- loves to live in New York, and has delivered New York because that's where these unique jobs are."

We are full speed ahead on the Penn District and are confident of its success. Farley as well along, we delivered half of Facebook 730,000 square feet on January 1, and we will deliver the second half on June 1, just 1 month from that. At PENN1, we will deliver the 34th Street lobby in July, the building's enormous amenity package in October and the 33rd Street lobby at year-end. And PENN2 and the Long Island Railroad concourse developments are now under full-scale construction. This transformation will take over a couple of years to complete.  
The decision to permanently close the Hotel Pennsylvania will allow us to get this site ready for development in less than 2 years from now, which is perfect timing for the next phase of our Penn District mega project. I believe that the Hotel Penn site will be the best development site in town. Notwithstanding that we will be delivering for tenants the most robust and unique amenitized offering in the city, with the aided convenience of being directly on top of New York's main transportation hub, our strategy here is to price PENN1 and PENN2 below our neighbors to the West under their price umbrella. Since we are coming off $60 rents, this will be an outstanding outcome. Over time, as we continue to remake the Penn District, I fully expect rents will aggressively rise to the premium that they deserve.  
Over the summer and into the early fall, we will be reopening and returning to normal. All of our tenants are telling us that they are anxious to bring their employees back to the office, and we are anxious to welcome them back. We remain strong in our belief that working from the office will be the preferred mode of work for companies and their employees post-pandemic. The kitchen table may be a place for some, but I continue to believe the urban office is the workplace of the future.  
As I have said, I believe we will come out of this difficult year in an economic boom, fueled by a tsunami of government stimulus, of which New York is a very major beneficiary. The financial sector is now booming. Tech is now booming. Health care is now booming. Retailers like Walmart, Target and Home Depot are now booming, and there is enormous pent-up demand from consumers eager to travel, meaning tourists returning to New York and spend on all manner of goods and services. This is beginning to happen all across the country.  Importantly, the major tech companies are telling us that they intend to continue growing their office footprints in New York's deep and diverse talent pool is unrivaled anywhere. As you can tell, we are very bullish on New York.  
Finally, a word about ESG. We filed our 2020 ESG report on Form 8-K in April -- on April 12. We continue to demonstrate our leadership here, and we're proud of the many awards and recognitions we have received. This is an important topic that we believe in.

The decrease this quarter is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 4 and in our financial supplement on Page 6 and was driven by the following items: $0.04 of our variable businesses, trade shows, signage, garages and BMS still being offline, $0.07 from tenant vacancies and bad debts, primarily the JCPenney and New York and Company lease rejections last year; $0.03 from Penn District space taken out of service; $0.03 from Macy's lease cancellation income in last year's first quarter, partially offset by $0.05 from G&A and interest savings. These items are not new news and are right in line with our statements over the past few quarters. Most of these are temporary, and the income will return over time.  
Furthermore, the first quarter results are consistent with the sequential fourth quarter run rate we discussed last quarter, adjusted for the accelerated vesting of equity awards, for retirement age executives in the first quarter.  
With respect to rent collections in the first quarter, overall rent collections were 96%, a continued improvement from the prior quarters. We collected 97% of office rents and 90% of retail rents. April collections ran at the same level.  
While the aggregate headline same-store cash NOI numbers for the first quarter are negative on their face, excluding the variable businesses, our core New York office business actually was positive 3.9%. Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was a positive 1.9%. The big takeaway here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company is continuing to hold on its own in this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. And while the retail same-store numbers are down, overall retail NOI is flat quarter-over-quarter, again, consistent with our recent guidance.  
Finally, we have planned to see us for significant growth as the pandemic recedes and the city returns to normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the previously announced overhead reduction program, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses. From the Farley Buildings fully coming online in 2022, followed by the delivery of PENN1 and PENN2, and reduced interest costs as we roll over our debt. One of the analysts even predicted the Vornado will have the highest growth rate in our sector over the next several years.  
Now turning to leasing markets. We are seeing improved conditions in the office leasing market with the pace of activity up nicely in the past 60 days. The phones are rinning, tour volume is up, proposals are coming in and leases are being signed with the flight to quality trend accelerating. According to the brokerage houses, leasing volume is certainly up versus 2020 numbers. The first quarter had the most activity of any since the fourth quarter of 2019, with most of the actions occurring in Midtown. At the same time, we are realistic and recognize that availability across all submarkets remains high. But an encouraging sign, sublease space has recently come down some. Almost 600,000 square feet of sublease space has been removed from the market by occupiers who plan to reoccupy the space. Moreover, a substantial portion of the sublease inventory is challenged space, either physically, by way of the over tenant having poor credit quality or turn constrained, roughly a 1/4 of the sublease space in the market today has less than 3 years of term.
During the first quarter, we completed 12 office leases totaling 208,000 square feet. The 2 largest leases of the quarter were both new to our portfolio. Young Adult Institute for 74,000 square feet at 825 7th Avenue for the new state-of-the-art schooling facility; and FuboTV Inc. a new world content streaming platform coming off their successful IPO launch for 55,000 square feet in the base of 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Both of these leases represented expansions from their prior locations.  We are currently negotiating paper on 300,000 square feet, of which 200,000 square feet is with new tenants. And in addition, we have a growing pipeline of 1.4 million square feet, which is up meaningfully from recent quarters. 
Last year, we completed the 2 largest leases in the year, Facebook and NYU. The current sweet spot for deal-making in the market is with small to midsized firms looking to relocate into new or redeveloped assets. Remember, all of our space is redeveloped, only the Penn District, which is under redevelopment. This dynamic matches up well with our current vacancy, where our largest available blocks are only 180,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street and 117,000 square feet at share at 85 Tenth Avenue.  
As a reminder, our office expirations in 2021 and 2022 are very modest, with less than 5% of our space rolling each year and a portion of this in PENN1. Our leasing team is now in full stride in the Penn District with multiple presentations, tours and meetings each day with brokers and tenants across all industry types. Using our new Penn District Experience center to showcase PENN1, PENN2 and our grand plans for the Penn District really brings everything to life. The reception to our vision for the district and our best market differentiated project offerings has been nothing short of phenomenon.  
Turning now to Chicago and San Francisco. In Chicago, we are also seeing more activity at the market. During the first quarter, we completed 85,000 square feet of leases including a 45,000 square foot office renewal, along with 18 showroom transactions totaling 40,000 square feet, of which 15 were renewals. We currently have a 90,000 square foot renewal lease in negotiation. And a pipeline of 500,000 square feet showing real interest in the property. Importantly, we will be restarting the trade show business in October this year with the NeoCon show, beginning to bring back that income stream.  
In San Francisco, 555 California continues to be in a league of its own coming off the heels of our recent large renewals with both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. In April, we executed a lease renewal with KKR in the triple digits for its 50,000 square feet in the tower. Our occupancy here is 98% with minimal expirations until 2023.  
Turning to retail now. Retail leasing in New York City is beginning to come out of a period of inactivity to a phase of retailers who are succeeding and even thriving are now looking for opportunities. All current leasing activity is very price driven. The tourists driven higher rent markets of Fifth Avenue and Times Square have seen the least activity as retailers remain on pause until there is greater visibility and when the 60-plus million tourists will return.  
During the quarter, we completed 11 retail leases for 46,000 square feet. These included 2 long-term renewals at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, including a lease with JPMorgan Chase for a flagship branch, and a 7-year extension with the luxury retailer Tods at 650 Madison Avenue.  Our leasing also included another 6 leases assigned at the Farley concourse, where demand remains strong, and we are in negotiations with tenants to fill the balance of the concourse space.  Overall, we are upbeat about the future of our markets, our leading position in them and our prospects for creating value.  
Turning to the capital markets now. First, let me congratulate Jan LaChapelle on her promotion to Executive Vice President, Head of Capital Markets. The real estate financing markets continue to improve with both the CMBS market-wide open and banks beginning to lend again a high quality office. Spreads in all-in coupons are at very attractive levels as evidenced by our recent strong refinancings of One Park and 909 Third Avenue, both of which were at significantly reduced rates. The unsecured market for real estate companies also continues to be very strong, and it is likely that we may shift over time to a more balanced approach between unsecured and secured debt.  
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.94 billion, including $1.76 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities.  
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than that, I don't think it would be premature t",666,"I really don't think it's appropriate to comment on this. We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than that, I don't think it would be premature to get into any details. But I'll give you a little bit of what our thinking is. And by the way, attracting stock is something that has been used very successfully by folks like John Malone at Liberty and his sidekick Greg Maffei and Barry Diller and -- for example. And generally, what it's used is when you have a business inside of your core, which is different, and which has a different rate of growth and different characteristics. 
And so we feel that the Penn District mega project that we have is different than our core assets. And so we feel that investors would benefit enormously by being able to invest in the Penn District and its characteristics. By the way, we do remember it's a development company for better or for worse and our core assets. 
So the differentiating aspects of the Penn District is at what we consider to be the epicenter of the new New York. It's directly on top of the major transportation hub, which means all of the subways at all of the railroads, all of them come into that hub. And that's an extraordinary statement because you can get in and out of Penn station no matter where you are in the New York City region on one ride. The most important part of it is -- and by the way, it's enormous. When you look at the number of assets and the scale of the assets and the number of blocks that we accomplish is pretty much enormous. 
The most interesting part of it, I think from my point of view, and Glen's point of view is it's a cluster of buildings that are interconnected generally underground. So what that means is that a tenant who has a 300,000 square foot required, and I have written about this, who goes into a 500,000 square-foot building is locked in, there's no place to go. But a 300,000 square foot tenant in our 5 million growing to 10 million growing to 15 million square foot complex has enormous opportunities to grow should they want in the same building or in adjacent buildings. So I believe that a strategy, which involves a cluster of buildings in a campus, which also will allow for an enormous series of amenities that somebody who has even a giant million foot building can't afford to do makes us totally unique. 
We're seeing very much the same thing down in Northern Virginia, where our SpinCo, JBG Smith, has this enormous concentration of buildings and land, et cetera, in the Crystal City Complex that Vornado contributed to that company when we did the spin in 2015. We've now attracted Amazon HQ2 there, mainly because of the concentration of assets that we have and obviously, because it's a great labor market. The same is true of our New York Penn District. So what we're trying to do and the objective is to take businesses which are different, meaning the Penn District is different than a core office building on even Park Avenue and allow investors to have the choice. 
So we're very excited about it. It's a very important work in process, and more details will be coming as we  advance it and when we announce it. I think somebody said in their reports last night that it was not well received by investors, which is troublesome to me. Because that's totally contrary to my feelings about it and our company feelings about it. And so if that's the case, then we have some work to do to talk to our investors and make everybody understand exactly what we're thinking about. But we couldn't be more excited. And I think that's it for now."

So I'm going to focus on two, what I perceived to be positive in your portfolio. Steve, in your news -- in your Chairman's letter, you outlined your Netflix binging and the fact that studios are now on your radar. It would seem with the JCPenney space at Manhattan Mall and the Penn Station, Penn District redevelopment, both of those assets have huge loading docks, huge amounts of potential space that can be carved out. And obviously, being in the city is incredibly convenient for studios versus people having to truck out to Queens or some of the outer boroughs. What are your thoughts on converting either those 2 assets or some of your other existing that have those sorts of attributes to studios?"

And so what's happened is, is that the streaming business and the entertainment business has become an unbelievably powerful, dynamically growing business and it's consolidating. And so the companies that are in that business are huge financial entities. And they all have a hankering and I mean a very strong desire to be in New York. Apparently, there is a significant, maybe even dominant concentration of talent in New York. And so it's really basically, they stay in 3 places: New York, Southern California and, I guess, in one of the European cities. 
But -- so the point being is that there is a tremendous amount of unserved demand. And so we're responding to incoming. And so we have assets that could service that demand. Now I could take a way too aggressive statement that says the Penn District could become Hollywood east. So I don't take that to the bank, by the way. But there's a great deal of interest in some of our assets that we are working on.  Nothing imminent. We're just responding to where we see pockets of unique demand in the marketplace."

It's obviously a candidate for a teardown and rebuild. But in teardown and rebuild is a combination, and we can grow the site too, by the way, as speculated in the press. So we could grow in something that's 200 million square foot building if we wanted to. Just focus on our own site without growing it, which will be a million square foot building. So that is an immense financial undertaking, which would require record rents, which we have talked several tenants about. And we may do that, but the likelihood is we will not do that. The more likely outcome is that we will rent up the existing 350 Park Avenue at a very favorable rent and sort of like post loan interest cycle  and retain the option of doing a new build on it or continuing to rent the existing building over time. 
So it's more likely that we will not do a teardown on that site and rent it out for one more cycle and focus our efforts on the Penn Station district. That's the more likely outcome. Although we couldn't be more delighted. By the way, if we decided that we wanted to sell that asset, with all of its optionality, in terms of a new build or whatever, we think we could get an extraordinary price for it.

The only thing that I'm uncomfortable about talking about is that the consensus feeling amongst almost everybody. So consensus is something to be concerned about. Normally, I'd like to be on the other side of that, but it is the consensus, and that is also what I believe. And I think it's happening. If you go to other places around the country, which have not been as shut down as New York. It's happening now. You go to Texas, et cetera, where they have different, where they have been more lenient in the restrictions. You can't -- you go into a Target store and the shelves are empty. You go into some of the luxury retailers across the country and the shelves are empty. The demand is amazing. They can't build enough houses, et cetera. So I think that's pretty clear. 
The Biden's policies, together with the fact that the majority leader of the Senate is from New York, there is a significant and fair, by the way, in terms of when you look at distribution of these programs across the nation. There is a significant amount of benefit -- financial benefit that's coming to New York in terms of the stimulus package. First, in terms of closing the budget deficits for the city and state, which is a universal program across the country, but it's good that we're getting in, and other benefits to our population. So we think that the stimulus will be an enormous benefit to New York, and I think that's proving out. 
With respect to the mayoral race, that's a different kind of a fish. The oddity about politics in New York is that more than 2/3 -- more than 75% of the registered voters are Democrat in the city. And so therefore, the mayor race is not the election, it's the primary, so almost invariably whoever wins the Democrat primary is elected mayor in the general election. There are -- double-digit number of candidates. And interestingly, there's really no candidate, which has a defining lead. We also have ranked choice voting for the first time, so nobody really quite knows how that works. So the first -- the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates are certainly all in the race. 
I'm hopeful that the candidates will all believe in a couple of principles that I think we believe in. First, that the quality of life is if not the single biggest issue, the biggest issue, and that is safe streets, clean streets. For example, the homeless situation has to be handled. And so quality of life issues are very important that they're #1 on my list. On my list, the second is that we need to be a growing city with growing -- with employment growing, which I think everybody subscribes to, which means we have to be a business-friendly city. And so every once in a while, we have plugged on that. The Amazon disaster a couple of years ago in Long Island city is probably the #1 example of that. So quality of life, safe cities, the homeless situation, being business-friendly are my -- the #1 and 2. We then have income inequality, racial inequality, we have to be a fair city. And so those are the major issues, I think, in the campaign. And I believe that the 3 or 4 candidates who are -- look like they have the best chance of being elected are all well-qualified with respect to that. 
I think one of the very interesting things about elections is that this is a time when the political leadership or the political aspirants actually listen to the population. And I think that the message that I just said, and I think is the universal message that's going from the voters to the politicians. It may be -- some groups of voters may say, income inequality and racial inequality is more important. Others may say business-friendly and quality of life. But those 4 major points are the issues, I think, in our city at every other great city, probably in the world right now.  And I'm very hopeful that we will get a mayor one of the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates that will be well-qualified in that regard."

We are, as they say, loaded up on New York, and we think we like our position. I am disappointed that there has not been in this period, unique opportunities to add value by buying distress, which is something that we have been able to do in past cycles. But that's not the way this has worked out. So this has kind of been a weird period. We've gone through a recession, a COVID-caused recession. It really didn't hurt our main businesses, in terms of our occupancies, but it did nick our income by $200 million because certain of our businesses were shut down like signage and garages, et cetera. 
On the other hand, interest -- and the other benefit of that is interest rates are historically low, chronically low. It looks like they're going to be low forever, which is something I think we have to be a little bit thoughtful about before we subscribe to that. But there really hasn't been very much in terms of distress that we've been able to buy, although we've been looking very hard. So I'm disappointed in that, but what is, is. I do believe that the best opportunity that we have for capital in our business, by far and away, is investing in the Penn District, which I think if one has a 5- and even a 10-year view, is going to be one of the great investments and one of the great developments in -- out there.

There is a -- and by the way, this is a very difficult cycle because, in addition to everything else, we have the secular change from brick-and-mortar retailer to internet shopping, which is a secular change, which sort of makes this cycle much deeper. Nonetheless, it's the cycle. So there's lots of vacancies. 
The first thing that happens is that the vacancies are scooped up by a group of tenants who realize the value and who have business models that can operate and thrive with reasonable rents. When the vacancy starts to get to be absorbed, the rents rise. And during the whole process, the highest quality space demand -- commands the highest rents and the highest demand. So that's beginning to happen now. 
And as Haim said a few moments ago, the retailers that have thrived are beginning to recognize that this is the bottom and are beginning to recognize that they want to add and even in New York aggressively add at this price point, the unique, important scarce site. So an example the that is that we did a deal with Fendi on Madison Avenue 57th Street recently. We extended a lease with Tods on Madison Avenue at 60th Street recently. And there's multiple other examples of that. So what's going to happen is, I wouldn't focus on the spot rent today, that's meaningless. That's the rent that is -- that rent will disappear in a year. And so what's happening is the smart players, the players who have a business model that works are beginning to absorb the good space and that will cause the market to shift. And in a year or 18 months or so, you'll see a totally different market. And in 3 years from now, you'll see a monumentally different market, which will be thriving with much higher rents."

In the last summer, if you remember, the Facebook lease, which covers 730,000 square feet in Moynihan and in Farley is totally unique space that we believe and I think they believe is unique across the country for where it is in the city of New York. And the scale of it being a low-rise with 150,000 square foot floor plate. So we anecdotally talk to their -- some of their occupiers, their engineers. They are very excited. They can't wait to get into the space. And other than that, we're not going to comment on the financial details."

So for example, gaming is an",669,"That's an unanswerable question. The reason I put that in there was, I think that our shareholders have a -- would like to know some of the things that are parking below the surface, even though they may not be that imminent. So for example, gaming is an interesting thing. There are -- everybody that follows New York knows that there are 3 gaming licenses that are yet to be issued in the New York, in the New York Enabling Legislation and that they are targeted for down state. And there's been a fair amount of news about that recently, where some people who are following not our company, but following the basic ebb and flow of stuff in New York knows about this. 
Now those 3 licenses are scheduled to be released in 2023, but there has been a great deal of speculation and press that, that may be accelerated earlier because of the budget deficits, et cetera. The urgency may be offset a little bit because the general governments close those deficits, but who knows. So we have probably the largest portfolio, and we have been receiving multiple incomings from the gaming industry operators who will be applying for those licenses and competing for those licenses. And so the inquiries that we have gotten have been for Manhattan properties. And it turns out that if consensus that our potential assets are probably the best. We have multiple assets, and they're probably the best suited for this kind of activity. 
So now, I mean, we have -- we realize that there is in the enabling legislation, which was passed 4, 5 or 6 years ago, there's a prohibition against gaming in Manhattan. So that's sort of a disconnect. Why are the operators coming in, in multiple inquiries about our assets when there's a prohibition? So the market is sort of saying, well, maybe that prohibition doesn't make a lot of sense, et cetera. So when you think about it, there's going to be 3 licenses issued. It does make sense that one would be to the east of the Long Island region. One would be to the Westchester region, and then there is the third. 
Well, and as I wrote about this, fairly short was it doesn't make a lot of sense for that third license to be issued in direct competition, the one on Long Island or one in Westchester, and that leaves Manhattan, which may be the golden goose in terms of getting revenue for our school systems and what have you. So it's impossible to predict how this comes out. We have multiple assets that are of high interest to these folks. This is a complicated political process. And all I can say is we're just satisfying incoming interest and we'll see where that goes. But you can discount that to 0 in your spreadsheet. Although if it did happen, it would be financially interesting. We have no, no, no interest in being in the gaming industry or being an operator or anything like that. We are a real estate vendor. That's what we do. 
With respect to the sound space business, it's exactly the same story. We are a real estate vendor. We are not going Hollywood. Although I think some of us would like to have a bit part somewhere, whatever. And we are responding to incomings from an industry, which is a streaming industry, which is unbelievably hot. They have a quick deal of interest in being in Manhattan because that's where the talent is. So these are nascent ideas, which I put into the letter because I think our shareholders are entitled to know some of the things that are going on in the background. These will undoubtedly not become large parts of our business, but who knows. 
Just remember, I said, you can look at -- the Penn District, it could be Hollywood, Hollywood East. It won't, for sure, but it's an interesting thing that sort of fantasize about."

Now I agree with you that the folks in various governments. By the way, the price may come out of Washington in terms of taxation, Albany maybe a second runner here. But the point of it is, is that the loss of some very high earners who are at retirement age, by the way, is something that is happening. It's happening all around the country. It's more -- it's happening more aggressively in California, by the way. And California folks they flee to Texas, and New York folks flee to Florida. 
What I'm saying basically is the backbone of New York is not the 20 or 30 hedge funds trillionaires or billionaires who are going to Florida or wherever. The backbone of New York is the $300,000, $500,000, even $1 million earning management people in their prime, in their 40s who are raising families, et cetera, whose jobs can -- who are not the heads of their businesses and can live anywhere, whose jobs and future depends upon being in New York, where they can do 3x better than they can do anywhere else. As 
long as that -- as long as that holds, New York will be fine. And as we see it, people like JPMorgan Chase building, their new headquarters building, et cetera. The businesses that are -- I'm not talking about the entrepreneurs who can live anywhere. And there are a very small number of people, although they're very exponentially important. The mass of the talent that New York has pretty much is staying in New York, has to stay in New York, wants to stay in New York, loves to stay -- loves to live in New York, and has to live in New York because that's where these unique jobs are."

We are full speed ahead on the Penn District and are confident of its success. Farley as well along, we delivered half of Facebook 730,000 square feet on January 1, and we will deliver the second half on June 1, just 1 month from that. At PENN1, we will deliver the 34th Street lobby in July, the building's enormous amenity package in October and the 33rd Street lobby at year-end. And PENN2 and the Long Island Railroad concourse developments are now under full-scale construction. This transformation will take over a couple of years to complete.  
The decision to permanently close the Hotel Pennsylvania will allow us to get this site ready for development in less than 2 years from now, which is perfect timing for the next phase of our Penn District mega project. I believe that the Hotel Penn site will be the best development site in town. Notwithstanding that we will be delivering for tenants the most robust and unique amenitized offering in the city, with the aided convenience of being directly on top of New York's main transportation hub, our strategy here is to price PENN1 and PENN2 below our neighbors to the West under their price umbrella. Since we are coming off $60 rents, this will be an outstanding outcome. Over time, as we continue to remake the Penn District, I fully expect rents will aggressively rise to the premium that they deserve.  
Over the summer and into the early fall, we will be reopening and returning to normal. All of our tenants are telling us that they are anxious to bring their employees back to the office, and we are anxious to welcome them back. We remain strong in our belief that working from the office will be the preferred mode of work for companies and their employees post-pandemic. The kitchen table may be a place for some, but I continue to believe the urban office is the workplace of the future.  
As I have said, I believe we will come out of this difficult year in an economic boom, fueled by a tsunami of government stimulus, of which New York is a very major beneficiary. The financial sector is now booming. Tech is now booming. Health care is now booming. Retailers like Walmart, Target and Home Depot are now booming, and there is enormous pent-up demand from consumers eager to travel, meaning tourists returning to New York and spend on all manner of goods and services. This is beginning to happen all across the country.  Importantly, the major tech companies are telling us that they intend to continue growing their office footprints in New York's deep and diverse talent pool is unrivaled anywhere. As you can tell, we are very bullish on New York.  
Finally, a word about ESG. We filed our 2020 ESG report on Form 8-K in April -- on April 12. We continue to demonstrate our leadership here, and we're proud of the many awards and recognitions we have received. This is an important topic that we believe in. Please do take a look at this important report.

I too hope you're all safe and healthy and look forward to seeing you again in person soon. Let me start with our first quarter financial results, and I'll end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets.  
First quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.65 per share compared to $0.77 for last year's first quarter. A decrease of $0.12, primarily due to the effects of the COVID shutdown. One change you will note is that the Hotel Pennsylvania results removed to noncomparable given our decision to permanently close the hotel. The decrease this quarter is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 4 and in our financial supplement on Page 6 and was driven by the following items: $0.04 of our variable businesses, trade shows, signage, garages and BMS still being offline, $0.07 from tenant vacancies and bad debts, primarily the JCPenney and New York and Company lease rejections last year; $0.03 from Penn District space taken out of service; $0.03 from Macy's lease cancellation income in last year's first quarter, partially offset by $0.05 from G&A and interest savings. These items are not new news and are right in line with our statements over the past few quarters. Most of these are temporary, and the income will return over time.  
Furthermore, the first quarter results are consistent with the sequential fourth quarter run rate we discussed last quarter, adjusted for the accelerated vesting of equity awards, for retirement age executives in the first quarter.  
With respect to rent collections in the first quarter, overall rent collections were 96%, a continued improvement from the prior quarters. We collected 97% of office rents and 90% of retail rents. April collections ran at the same level.  
While the aggregate headline same-store cash NOI numbers for the first quarter are negative on their face, excluding the variable businesses, our core New York office business actually was positive 3.9%. Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was a positive 1.9%. The big takeaway here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company is continuing to hold on its own in this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. And while the retail same-store numbers are down, overall retail NOI is flat quarter-over-quarter, again, consistent with our recent guidance.  
Finally, we have planned to see us for significant growth as the pandemic recedes and the city returns to normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the previously announced overhead reduction program, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses. From the Farley Buildings fully coming online in 2022, followed by the delivery of PENN1 and PENN2, and reduced interest costs as we roll over our debt. One of the analysts even predicted the Vornado will have the highest growth rate in our sector over the next several years.  
Now turning to leasing markets. We are seeing improved conditions in the office leasing market with the pace of activity up nicely in the past 60 days. The phones are rinning, tour volume is up, proposals are coming in and leases are being signed with the flight to quality trend accelerating. According to the brokerage houses, leasing volume is certainly up versus 2020 numbers. The first quarter had the most activity of any since the fourth quarter of 2019, with most of the actions occurring in Midtown. At the same time, we are realistic and recognize that availability across all submarkets remains high. But an encouraging sign, sublease space has recently come down some. Almost 600,000 square feet of sublease space has been removed from the market by occupiers who plan to reoccupy the space. Moreover, a substantial portion of the sublease inventory is challenged space, either physically, by way of the over tenant having poor credit quality or turn constrained, roughly a 1/4 of the sublease space in the market today has less than 3 years of term.
During the first quarter, we completed 12 office leases totaling 208,000 square feet. The 2 largest leases of the quarter were both new to our portfolio. Young Adult Institute for 74,000 square feet at 825 7th Avenue for the new state-of-the-art schooling facility; and FuboTV Inc. a new world content streaming platform coming off their successful IPO launch for 55,000 square feet in the base of 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Both of these leases represented expansions from their prior locations.  We are currently negotiating paper on 300,000 square feet, of which 200,000 square feet is with new tenants. And in addition, we have a growing pipeline of 1.4 million square feet, which is up meaningfully from recent quarters. 
Last year, we completed the 2 largest leases in the year, Facebook and NYU. The current sweet spot for deal-making in the market is with small to midsized firms looking to relocate into new or redeveloped assets. Remember, all of our space is redeveloped, only the Penn District, which is under redevelopment. This dynamic matches up well with our current vacancy, where our largest available blocks are only 180,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street and 117,000 square feet at share at 85 Tenth Avenue.  
As a reminder, our office expirations in 2021 and 2022 are very modest, with less than 5% of our space rolling each year and a portion of this in PENN1. Our leasing team is now in full stride in the Penn District with multiple presentations, tours and meetings each day with brokers and tenants across all industry types. Using our new Penn District Experience center to showcase PENN1, PENN2 and our grand plans for the Penn District really brings everything to life. The reception to our vision for the district and our best market differentiated project offerings has been nothing short of phenomenon.  
Turning now to Chicago and San Francisco. In Chicago, we are also seeing more activity at the market. During the first quarter, we completed 85,000 square feet of leases including a 45,000 square foot office renewal, along with 18 showroom transactions totaling 40,000 square feet, of which 15 were renewals. We currently have a 90,000 square foot renewal lease in negotiation. And a pipeline of 500,000 square feet showing real interest in the property. Importantly, we will be restarting the trade show business in October this year with the NeoCon show, beginning to bring back that income stream.  
In San Francisco, 555 California continues to be in a league of its own coming off the heels of our recent large renewals with both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. In April, we executed a lease renewal with KKR in the triple digits for its 50,000 square feet in the tower. Our occupancy here is 98% with minimal expirations until 2023.  
Turning to retail now. Retail leasing in New York City is beginning to come out of a period of inactivity to a phase of retailers who are succeeding and even thriving are now looking for opportunities. All current leasing activity is very price driven. The tourists driven higher rent markets of Fifth Avenue and Times Square have seen the least activity as retailers remain on pause until there is greater visibility and when the 60-plus million tourists will return.  
During the quarter, we completed 11 retail leases for 46,000 square feet. These included 2 long-term renewals at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, including a lease with JPMorgan Chase for a flagship branch, and a 7-year extension with the luxury retailer Tods at 650 Madison Avenue.  Our leasing also included another 6 leases assigned at the Farley concourse, where demand remains strong, and we are in negotiations with tenants to fill the balance of the concourse space.  Overall, we are upbeat about the future of our markets, our leading position in them and our prospects for creating value.  
Turning to the capital markets now. First, let me congratulate Jan LaChapelle on her promotion to Executive Vice President, Head of Capital Markets. The real estate financing markets continue to improve with both the CMBS market-wide open and banks beginning to lend again a high quality office. Spreads in all-in coupons are at very attractive levels as evidenced by our recent strong refinancings of One Park and 909 Third Avenue, both of which were at significantly reduced rates. The unsecured market for real estate companies also continues to be very strong, and it is likely that we may shift over time to a more balanced approach between unsecured and secured debt.  
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.94 billion, including $1.76 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities.  
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than that, I don't think it would be premature t",666,"I really don't think it's appropriate to comment on this. We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than that, I don't think it would be premature to get into any details. But I'll give you a little bit of what our thinking is. And by the way, attracting stock is something that has been used very successfully by folks like John Malone at Liberty and his sidekick Greg Maffei and Barry Diller and -- for example. And generally, what it's used is when you have a business inside of your core, which is different, and which has a different rate of growth and different characteristics. 
And so we feel that the Penn District mega project that we have is different than our core assets. And so we feel that investors would benefit enormously by being able to invest in the Penn District and its characteristics. By the way, we do remember it's a development company for better or for worse and our core assets. 
So the differentiating aspects of the Penn District is at what we consider to be the epicenter of the new New York. It's directly on top of the major transportation hub, which means all of the subways at all of the railroads, all of them come into that hub. And that's an extraordinary statement because you can get in and out of Penn station no matter where you are in the New York City region on one ride. The most important part of it is -- and by the way, it's enormous. When you look at the number of assets and the scale of the assets and the number of blocks that we accomplish is pretty much enormous. 
The most interesting part of it, I think from my point of view, and Glen's point of view is it's a cluster of buildings that are interconnected generally underground. So what that means is that a tenant who has a 300,000 square foot required, and I have written about this, who goes into a 500,000 square-foot building is locked in, there's no place to go. But a 300,000 square foot tenant in our 5 million growing to 10 million growing to 15 million square foot complex has enormous opportunities to grow should they want in the same building or in adjacent buildings. So I believe that a strategy, which involves a cluster of buildings in a campus, which also will allow for an enormous series of amenities that somebody who has even a giant million foot building can't afford to do makes us totally unique. 
We're seeing very much the same thing down in Northern Virginia, where our SpinCo, JBG Smith, has this enormous concentration of buildings and land, et cetera, in the Crystal City Complex that Vornado contributed to that company when we did the spin in 2015. We've now attracted Amazon HQ2 there, mainly because of the concentration of assets that we have and obviously, because it's a great labor market. The same is true of our New York Penn District. So what we're trying to do and the objective is to take businesses which are different, meaning the Penn District is different than a core office building on even Park Avenue and allow investors to have the choice. 
So we're very excited about it. It's a very important work in process, and more details will be coming as we  advance it and when we announce it. I think somebody said in their reports last night that it was not well received by investors, which is troublesome to me. Because that's totally contrary to my feelings about it and our company feelings about it. And so if that's the case, then we have some work to do to talk to our investors and make everybody understand exactly what we're thinking about. But we couldn't be more excited. And I think that's it for now."

Steve, in your news -- in your Chairman's letter, you outlined your Netflix binging and the fact that studios are now on your radar. It would seem with the JCPenney space at Manhattan Mall and the Penn Station, Penn District redevelopment, both of those assets have huge loading docks, huge amounts of potential space that can be carved out.

We all know the issues about the streetscape and the neighborhood and the desire to see that improve. When you look at Grand Central, that area is already there. East side access is clearly going to frighten away a huge chunk of long Island commuters, and you guys have 350 Park. It would seem that 350 is almost a better site than Hotel Penn, just given that the neighborhood is already there, and there are a lot more people being excited by the commuter hub and you have East side access coming in the next few years. So what are your thoughts on accelerating 350? And where does that fit in your pipeline as you guys or Glen market anchoring a Hotel Penn versus getting tenants anchor at 350?"

We have -- obviously, we have an enormous amount of respect for our 350 Park Avenue asset. It's a great asset. And it's kind of like bite size. It's a 500,000 square foot asset. It's obviously a candidate for a teardown and rebuild. But in teardown and rebuild is a combination, and we can grow the site too, by the way, as speculated in the press. So we could grow in something that's 200 million square foot building if we wanted to. Just focus on our own site without growing it, which will be a million square foot building. So that is an immense financial undertaking, which would require record rents, which we have talked several tenants about. And we may do that, but the likelihood is we will not do that. The more likely outcome is that we will rent up the existing 350 Park Avenue at a very favorable rent and sort of like post loan interest cycle  and retain the option of doing a new build on it or continuing to rent the existing building over time. 
So it's more likely that we will not do a teardown on that site and rent it out for one more cycle and focus our efforts on the Penn Station district. That's the more likely outcome. Although we couldn't be more delighted. By the way, if we decided that we wanted to sell that asset, with all of its optionality, in terms of a new build or whatever, we think we could get an extraordinary price for it.

The only thing that I'm uncomfortable about talking about is that the consensus feeling amongst almost everybody. So consensus is something to be concerned about. Normally, I'd like to be on the other side of that, but it is the consensus, and that is also what I believe. And I think it's happening. If you go to other places around the country, which have not been as shut down as New York. It's happening now. You go to Texas, et cetera, where they have different, where they have been more lenient in the restrictions. You can't -- you go into a Target store and the shelves are empty. You go into some of the luxury retailers across the country and the shelves are empty. The demand is amazing. They can't build enough houses, et cetera. So I think that's pretty clear. 
The Biden's policies, together with the fact that the majority leader of the Senate is from New York, there is a significant and fair, by the way, in terms of when you look at distribution of these programs across the nation. There is a significant amount of benefit -- financial benefit that's coming to New York in terms of the stimulus package. First, in terms of closing the budget deficits for the city and state, which is a universal program across the country, but it's good that we're getting in, and other benefits to our population. So we think that the stimulus will be an enormous benefit to New York, and I think that's proving out. 
With respect to the mayoral race, that's a different kind of a fish. The oddity about politics in New York is that more than 2/3 -- more than 75% of the registered voters are Democrat in the city. And so therefore, the mayor race is not the election, it's the primary, so almost invariably whoever wins the Democrat primary is elected mayor in the general election. There are -- double-digit number of candidates. And interestingly, there's really no candidate, which has a defining lead. We also have ranked choice voting for the first time, so nobody really quite knows how that works. So the first -- the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates are certainly all in the race. 
I'm hopeful that the candidates will all believe in a couple of principles that I think we believe in. First, that the quality of life is if not the single biggest issue, the biggest issue, and that is safe streets, clean streets. For example, the homeless situation has to be handled. And so quality of life issues are very important that they're #1 on my list. On my list, the second is that we need to be a growing city with growing -- with employment growing, which I think everybody subscribes to, which means we have to be a business-friendly city. And so every once in a while, we have plugged on that. The Amazon disaster a couple of years ago in Long Island city is probably the #1 example of that. So quality of life, safe cities, the homeless situation, being business-friendly are my -- the #1 and 2. We then have income inequality, racial inequality, we have to be a fair city. And so those are the major issues, I think, in the campaign. And I believe that the 3 or 4 candidates who are -- look like they have the best chance of being elected are all well-qualified with respect to that. 
I think one of the very interesting things about elections is that this is a time when the political leadership or the political aspirants actually listen to the population. And I think that the message that I just said, and I think is the universal message that's going from the voters to the politicians. It may be -- some groups of voters may say, income inequality and racial inequality is more important. Others may say business-friendly and quality of life. But those 4 major points are the issues, I think, in our city at every other great city, probably in the world right now.  And I'm very hopeful that we will get a mayor one of the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates that will be well-qualified in that regard."

We are, as they say, loaded up on New York, and we think we like our position. I am disappointed that there has not been in this period, unique opportunities to add value by buying distress, which is something that we have been able to do in past cycles. But that's not the way this has worked out. So this has kind of been a weird period. We've gone through a recession, a COVID-caused recession. It really didn't hurt our main businesses, in terms of our occupancies, but it did nick our income by $200 million because certain of our businesses were shut down like signage and garages, et cetera. 
On the other hand, interest -- and the other benefit of that is interest rates are historically low, chronically low. It looks like they're going to be low forever, which is something I think we have to be a little bit thoughtful about before we subscribe to that. But there really hasn't been very much in terms of distress that we've been able to buy, although we've been looking very hard. So I'm disappointed in that, but what is, is. I do believe that the best opportunity that we have for capital in our business, by far and away, is investing in the Penn District, which I think if one has a 5- and even a 10-year view, is going to be one of the great investments and one of the great developments in -- out there.

There is a -- and by the way, this is a very difficult cycle because, in addition to everything else, we have the secular change from brick-and-mortar retailer to internet shopping, which is a secular change, which sort of makes this cycle much deeper. Nonetheless, it's the cycle. So there's lots of vacancies. 
The first thing that happens is that the vacancies are scooped up by a group of tenants who realize the value and who have business models that can operate and thrive with reasonable rents. When the vacancy starts to get to be absorbed, the rents rise. And during the whole process, the highest quality space demand -- commands the highest rents and the highest demand. So that's beginning to happen now. 
And as Haim said a few moments ago, the retailers that have thrived are beginning to recognize that this is the bottom and are beginning to recognize that they want to add and even in New York aggressively add at this price point, the unique, important scarce site. So an example the that is that we did a deal with Fendi on Madison Avenue 57th Street recently. We extended a lease with Tods on Madison Avenue at 60th Street recently. And there's multiple other examples of that. So what's going to happen is, I wouldn't focus on the spot rent today, that's meaningless. That's the rent that is -- that rent will disappear in a year. And so what's happening is the smart players, the players who have a business model that works are beginning to absorb the good space and that will cause the market to shift. And in a year or 18 months or so, you'll see a totally different market. And in 3 years from now, you'll see a monumentally different market, which will be thriving with much higher rents."

The reason I put that in there was, I think that our shareholders have a -- would like to know some of the things that are parking below the surface, even though they may not be that imminent. So for example, gaming is an",669,"That's an unanswerable question. The reason I put that in there was, I think that our shareholders have a -- would like to know some of the things that are parking below the surface, even though they may not be that imminent. So for example, gaming is an interesting thing. There are -- everybody that follows New York knows that there are 3 gaming licenses that are yet to be issued in the New York, in the New York Enabling Legislation and that they are targeted for down state. And there's been a fair amount of news about that recently, where some people who are following not our company, but following the basic ebb and flow of stuff in New York knows about this. 
Now those 3 licenses are scheduled to be released in 2023, but there has been a great deal of speculation and press that, that may be accelerated earlier because of the budget deficits, et cetera. The urgency may be offset a little bit because the general governments close those deficits, but who knows. So we have probably the largest portfolio, and we have been receiving multiple incomings from the gaming industry operators who will be applying for those licenses and competing for those licenses. And so the inquiries that we have gotten have been for Manhattan properties. And it turns out that if consensus that our potential assets are probably the best. We have multiple assets, and they're probably the best suited for this kind of activity. 
So now, I mean, we have -- we realize that there is in the enabling legislation, which was passed 4, 5 or 6 years ago, there's a prohibition against gaming in Manhattan. So that's sort of a disconnect. Why are the operators coming in, in multiple inquiries about our assets when there's a prohibition? So the market is sort of saying, well, maybe that prohibition doesn't make a lot of sense, et cetera. So when you think about it, there's going to be 3 licenses issued. It does make sense that one would be to the east of the Long Island region. One would be to the Westchester region, and then there is the third. 
Well, and as I wrote about this, fairly short was it doesn't make a lot of sense for that third license to be issued in direct competition, the one on Long Island or one in Westchester, and that leaves Manhattan, which may be the golden goose in terms of getting revenue for our school systems and what have you. So it's impossible to predict how this comes out. We have multiple assets that are of high interest to these folks. This is a complicated political process. And all I can say is we're just satisfying incoming interest and we'll see where that goes. But you can discount that to 0 in your spreadsheet. Although if it did happen, it would be financially interesting. We have no, no, no interest in being in the gaming industry or being an operator or anything like that. We are a real estate vendor. That's what we do. 
With respect to the sound space business, it's exactly the same story. We are a real estate vendor. We are not going Hollywood. Although I think some of us would like to have a bit part somewhere, whatever. And we are responding to incomings from an industry, which is a streaming industry, which is unbelievably hot. They have a quick deal of interest in being in Manhattan because that's where the talent is. So these are nascent ideas, which I put into the letter because I think our shareholders are entitled to know some of the things that are going on in the background. These will undoubtedly not become large parts of our business, but who knows. 
Just remember, I said, you can look at -- the Penn District, it could be Hollywood, Hollywood East. It won't, for sure, but it's an interesting thing that sort of fantasize about."

Now I agree with you that the folks in various governments. By the way, the price may come out of Washington in terms of taxation, Albany maybe a second runner here. But the point of it is, is that the loss of some very high earners who are at retirement age, by the way, is something that is happening. It's happening all around the country. It's more -- it's happening more aggressively in California, by the way. And California folks they flee to Texas, and New York folks flee to Florida. 
What I'm saying basically is the backbone of New York is not the 20 or 30 hedge funds trillionaires or billionaires who are going to Florida or wherever. The backbone of New York is the $300,000, $500,000, even $1 million earning management people in their prime, in their 40s who are raising families, et cetera, whose jobs can -- who are not the heads of their businesses and can live anywhere, whose jobs and future depends upon being in New York, where they can do 3x better than they can do anywhere else. As 
long as that -- as long as that holds, New York will be fine. And as we see it, people like JPMorgan Chase building, their new headquarters building, et cetera. The businesses that are -- I'm not talking about the entrepreneurs who can live anywhere. And there are a very small number of people, although they're very exponentially important. The mass of the talent that New York has pretty much is staying in New York, has to stay in New York, wants to stay in New York, loves to stay -- loves to live in New York, and has to live in New York because that's where these unique jobs are."

We are full speed ahead on the Penn District and are confident of its success. Farley is well along, we delivered half of phase 1 of 730,000 square feet on January 1, and we will deliver the second half on June 1, just 1 month from that. At PENN1, we will deliver the 34th Street lobby in July, the building's enormous amenity package in October and the 33rd Street lobby at year-end. And PENN2 and the Long Island Railroad concourse developments are now under full-scale construction. This transformation will take over a couple of years to complete.  
The decision to permanently close the Hotel Pennsylvania will allow us to get this site ready for development in less than 2 years from now, which is perfect timing for the next phase of our Penn District mega project. I believe that the Hotel Penn site will be the best development site in town. Notwithstanding that we will be delivering for tenants the most robust and unique amenitized offering in the city, with the added convenience of being directly on top of New York's main transportation hub, our strategy here is to price PENN1 and PENN2 below our neighbors to the West under their price umbrella. Since we are coming off $60 rents, this will be an outstanding outcome. Over time, as we continue to remake the Penn District, I fully expect rents will aggressively rise to the premium that they deserve.  
Over the summer and into the early fall, we will be reopening and returning to normal. All of our tenants are telling us that they are anxious to bring their employees back to the office, and we are anxious to welcome them back. We remain strong in our belief that working from the office will be the preferred mode of work for companies and their employees post-pandemic. The kitchen table may be a place for some, but I continue to believe the urban office is the workplace of the future.  
As I have said, I believe we will come out of this difficult year in an economic boom, fueled by a tsunami of government stimulus, of which New York is a very major beneficiary. The financial sector is now booming. Tech is now booming. Health care is now booming. Retailers like Walmart, Target and Home Depot are now booming, and there is enormous pent-up demand from consumers eager to travel, meaning tourists returning to New York and spend on all manner of goods and services. This is beginning to happen all across the country.  Importantly, the major tech companies are telling us that they intend to continue growing their office footprints in New York, and that New York's deep and diverse talent pool is unrivaled anywhere. As you can tell, we are very bullish on New York.  
Finally, a word about ESG. We filed our 2020 ESG report on Form 8-K in April -- on April 12. We continue to demonstrate our leadership here, and we're proud of the many awards and recognitions we have received. This is an important topic that we believe in. Please do take a look at this important report.  
Now over to Michael for comment on our numbers and our businesses."

Let me start with our first quarter financial results, and I'll end with a few comments on the leasing and capital market",1467,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I too hope you're all safe and healthy and look forward to seeing you again in person soon. Let me start with our first quarter financial results, and I'll end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets.  
First quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.65 per share compared to $0.77 for last year's first quarter. A decrease of $0.12, primarily due to the effects of the COVID shutdown. One change you will note is that the Hotel Pennsylvania results were moved to noncomparable given our decision to permanently close the hotel. The decrease this quarter is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 4 and in our financial supplement on Page 6 and was driven by the following items: $0.04 of our variable businesses, trade shows, signage, garages and BMS still being offline, $0.07 from tenant vacancies and bad debts, primarily the JCPenney and New York and Company lease rejections last year; $0.03 from Penn District space taken out of service; $0.03 from Macy's lease cancellation income in last year's first quarter, partially offset by $0.05 from G&A and interest savings. These items are not new news and are right in line with our statements over the past few quarters. Most of these are temporary, and the income will return over time.  
Furthermore, the first quarter results are consistent with the sequential fourth quarter run rate we discussed last quarter, adjusted for the accelerated vesting of equity awards, for retirement age executives in the first quarter.  
With respect to rent collections in the first quarter, overall rent collections were 96%, a continued improvement from the prior quarters. We collected 97% of office rents and 90% of retail rents. April collections ran at the same level.  
While the aggregate headline same-store cash NOI numbers for the first quarter are negative on their face, excluding the variable businesses, our core New York office business actually was positive 3.9%. Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was a positive 1.9%. The big takeaway here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company, is continuing to hold on its own in this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. And while the retail same-store numbers are down, overall retail NOI is flat quarter-over-quarter, again, consistent with our recent guidance.  
Finally, we have planted the seeds for significant growth as the pandemic recedes and the city returns to normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the previously announced overhead reduction program, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses. From the Farley Buildings fully coming online in 2022, followed by the delivery of PENN1 and PENN2, and reduced interest costs as we roll over our debt. One of the analysts even predicted the Vornado will have the highest growth rate in our sector over the next several years.  
Now turning to leasing markets. We are seeing improved conditions in the office leasing market with the pace of activity up nicely in the past 60 days. The phones are ringing, tour volume is up, proposals are coming in and leases are being signed with the flight to quality trend accelerating. According to the brokerage houses, leasing volume is certainly up versus 2020 numbers. The first quarter had the most activity of any since the fourth quarter of 2019, with most of the actions occurring in Midtown. At the same time, we are realistic and recognize that availability across all submarkets remains high. But in an encouraging sign, sublease space has recently come down some. Almost 600,000 square feet of sublease space has been removed from the market by occupiers who plan to reoccupy the space. Moreover, a substantial portion of the sublease inventory is challenged space, either physically, by way of the older tenant having poor credit quality or turn constrained. Roughly a 1/4 of the sublease space in the market today has less than 3 years of term.
During the first quarter, we completed 12 office leases totaling 208,000 square feet. The 2 largest leases of the quarter were both new to our portfolio. Young Adult Institute for 74,000 square feet at 825 7th Avenue for the new state-of-the-art schooling facility; and FuboTV Inc. a new world content streaming platform coming off their successful IPO launch for 55,000 square feet in the base of 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Both of these leases represent expansions from their prior locations.  We are currently negotiating paper on 300,000 square feet, of which 200,000 square feet is with new tenants. And in addition, we have a growing pipeline of 1.4 million square feet, which is up meaningfully from recent quarters. 
Last year, we completed the 2 largest leases in the year, Facebook and NYU. The current sweet spot for deal-making in the market is with small to midsized firms looking to relocate into new or redeveloped assets. Remember, all of our space is redeveloped, only the Penn District, which is under redevelopment. This dynamic matches up well with our current vacancy, where our largest available blocks are only 180,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street and 117,000 square feet at share at 85 Tenth Avenue.  
As a reminder, our office expirations in 2021 and 2022 are very modest, with less than 5% of our space rolling each year and a portion of this in PENN1. Our leasing team is now in full stride in the Penn District with multiple presentations, tours and meetings each day with brokers and tenants across all industry types. Using our new Penn District Experience center to showcase PENN1, PENN2 and our grand plans for the Penn District really brings everything to life. The reception to our vision for the district and our best market differentiated project offerings has been nothing short of phenomenal.  
Turning now to Chicago and San Francisco. In Chicago, we are also seeing more activity at the market. During the first quarter, we completed 85,000 square feet of leases including a 45,000 square foot office renewal, along with 18 showroom transactions totaling 40,000 square feet, of which 15 were renewals. We currently have a 90,000 square foot renewal lease in negotiation, and a pipeline of 500,000 square feet showing real interest in the property. Importantly, we will be restarting the trade show business in October this year with the NeoCon show, beginning to bring back that income stream.  
In San Francisco, 555 California continues to be in a league of its own coming off the heels of our recent large renewals with both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. In April, we executed a lease renewal with KKR in the triple digits for its 50,000 square feet in the tower. Our occupancy here is 98% with minimal expirations until 2023.  
Turning to retail now. Retail leasing in New York City is beginning to come out of a period of inactivity to a phase of retailers who are succeeding and even thriving are now looking for opportunities. All current leasing activity is very price driven. The tourists driven higher rent markets of Fifth Avenue and Times Square have seen the least activity as retailers remain on pause until there is greater visibility and when the 60-plus million tourists will return.  
During the quarter, we completed 11 retail leases for 46,000 square feet. These included 2 long-term renewals at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, including a lease with JPMorgan Chase for a flagship branch, and a 7-year extension with the luxury retailer Tods at 650 Madison Avenue.  Our leasing also included another 6 leases assigned at the Farley concourse, where demand remains strong, and we are in negotiations with tenants to fill the balance of the concourse space.  Overall, we are upbeat about the future of our markets, our leading position in them and our prospects for creating value.  
Turning to the capital markets now. First, let me congratulate Jan LaChapelle on her promotion to Executive Vice President, Head of Capital Markets. The real estate financing markets continue to improve with both the CMBS market-wide open and banks beginning to lend again a high quality office. Spreads in all-in coupons are at very attractive levels as evidenced by our recent strong refinancings of One Park and 909 Third Avenue, both of which were at significantly reduced rates. The unsecured market for real estate companies also continues to be very strong, and it is likely that we may shift over time to a more balanced approach between unsecured and secured debt.  
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.94 billion, including $1.76 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities.  
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than that, I don't think -- it would be prematur",670,"I really don't think it's appropriate to comment on this. We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than that, I don't think -- it would be premature to get into any details. But I'll give you a little bit of what our thinking is. And by the way, tracking stock is something that has been used very successfully by folks like John Malone at Liberty and his sidekick Greg Maffei and Barry Diller and -- for example. And generally, what it's used is when you have a business inside of your core, which is different, and which has a different rate of growth and different characteristics. 
And so we feel that the Penn District mega project that we have is different than our core assets. And so we feel that investors would benefit enormously by being able to invest in the Penn District and its characteristics. By the way, we do remember it's a development company for better or for worse and our core assets. 
So the differentiating aspects of the Penn District is at what we consider to be the epicenter of the new New York. It's directly on top of the major transportation hub, which means all of the subways and all of the railroads, all of them come into that hub. And that's an extraordinary statement because you can get in and out of Penn station no matter where you are in the New York City region on one ride. The most important part of it is -- and by the way, it's enormous. When you look at the number of assets and the scale of the assets and the number of blocks that we accomplish is pretty much enormous. 
The most interesting part of it, I think from my point of view, and Glen's point of view is it's a cluster of buildings that are interconnected generally underground. So what that means is that a tenant who has a 300,000 square foot required, and I have written about this, who goes into a 500,000 square-foot building is locked in, there's no place to go. But a 300,000 square foot tenant in our 5 million growing to 10 million growing to 15 million square foot complex has enormous opportunities to grow should they want to in the same building or in adjacent buildings. So I believe that a strategy, which involves a cluster of buildings in a campus, which also will allow for an enormous series of amenities that somebody who has even a giant million foot building can't afford to do, makes us totally unique. 
We're seeing very much the same thing down in Northern Virginia, where our SpinCo, JBG Smith, has this enormous concentration of buildings and land, et cetera, in the Crystal City Complex that Vornado contributed to that company when we did the spin in 2015. We've now attracted Amazon HQ2 there, mainly because of the concentration of assets that we have and obviously, because it's a great labor market. The same is true of our New York Penn District. So what we're trying to do -- and the objective is to take businesses which are different, meaning the Penn District is different than a core office building on even Park Avenue -- and allow investors to have the choice. 
So we're very excited about it. It's a very important work in process, and more details will be coming as we advance it and when we announce it. I think somebody said in their reports last night that it was not well received by investors, which is troublesome to me. Because that's totally contrary to my feelings about it and our company feelings about it. And so if that's the case, then we have some work to do to talk to our investors and make everybody understand exactly what we're thinking about. But we couldn't be more excited. And I think that's it for now."

It would seem with the JCPenney space at Manhattan Mall and the Penn Station, Penn District redevelopment, both of those assets have huge loading docks, huge amounts of potential space that can be carved out.

We have -- obviously, we have an enormous amount of respect for our 350 Park Avenue asset. It's a great asset. And it's kind of like bite size. It's a 500,000 square foot asset. It's obviously a candidate for a teardown and rebuild. But a teardown and rebuild is a combination -- and we can grow the site too, by the way, as speculated in the press. So we could grow in something that's 200 million square foot building if we wanted to or just focus on our own site without growing it, which will be a million square foot building. So that is an immense financial undertaking, which would require record rents, which we have talked to several tenants about. And we may do that, but the likelihood is we will not do that. The more likely outcome is that we will rent up the existing 350 Park Avenue at a very favorable rent and sort of like postpone interest for a cycle  and retain the option of doing a new build on it or continuing to rent the existing building over time. 
So it's more likely that we will not do a teardown on that site and rent it out for one more cycle and focus our efforts on the Penn Station district. That's the more likely outcome. Although we couldn't be more delighted. By the way, if we decided that we wanted to sell that asset, with all of its optionality, in terms of a new build or whatever, we think we could get an extraordinary price for it. But that's not something that's high on our agenda right now."

There is a very, very large and very importantly, a diverse workforce and that's very important to these clients. So they have their fingers on the pulse of New York. They follow the real estate in New York as closely as we do. They all have very professional real estate organizations that we are in contact with frequently, almost daily.

By the way, their interest in New York is basically almost exclusively to the west side of New York. That's where their employees want to be, and that's where their culture says they want to be.

The only thing that I'm uncomfortable about talking about is that the consensus feeling amongst almost everybody. So consensus is something to be concerned about. Normally, I'd like to be on the other side of that, but it is the consensus, and that is also what I believe. And I think it's happening. If you go to other places around the country, which have not been as shut down as New York. It's happening now. You go to Texas, et cetera, where they have different, where they have been more lenient in the restrictions. You can't -- you go into a Target store and the shelves are empty. You go into some of the luxury retailers across the country and the shelves are empty. The demand is amazing. They can't build enough houses, et cetera. So I think that's pretty clear. 
The -- Biden's policies, together with the fact that the majority leader of the Senate is from New York, there is a significant and fair, by the way, in terms of when you look at distribution of these programs across the nation. There is a significant amount of benefit -- financial benefit that's coming to New York in terms of the stimulus package. First, in terms of closing the budget deficits for the city and state, which is a universal program across the country, but it's good that we're getting in, and other benefits to our population. So we think that the stimulus will be an enormous benefit to New York, and I think that's proving out. 
With respect to the mayoral race, that's a different kind of a fish. The oddity about politics in New York is that more than 2/3 -- more than 75% of the registered voters are Democrat in the city. And so therefore, the mayor race is not the election, it's the primary, so almost invariably whoever wins the Democrat primary is elected mayor in the general election. There are -- double-digit number of candidates. And interestingly, there's really no candidate, which has a defining lead. We also have ranked choice voting for the first time, so nobody really quite knows how that works. So the first -- the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates are certainly all in the race. 
I'm hopeful that the candidates will all believe in a couple of principles that I think we believe in. First, that the quality of life is if not the single biggest issue, the biggest issue, and that is safe streets, clean streets. For example, the homeless situation has to be handled. And so quality of life issues are very important that they're #1 on my list. On my list, the second is that we need to be a growing city with growing -- with employment growing, which I think everybody subscribes to, which means we have to be a business-friendly city. And so every once in a while, we have flubbed on that. The Amazon disaster a couple of years ago in Long Island city is probably the #1 example of that. So quality of life, safe cities, the homeless situation, being business-friendly are my -- the #1 and 2. We then have income inequality, racial inequality, we have to be a fair city. And so those are the major issues, I think, in the campaign. And I believe that the 3 or 4 candidates who are -- look like they have the best chance of being elected are all well-qualified with respect to that. 
I think one of the very interesting things about elections is that this is a time when the political leadership or the political aspirants actually listen to the population. And I think that the message that I just said, and I think is the universal message that's going from the voters to the politicians. It may be -- some groups of voters may say, income inequality and racial inequality is more important. Others may say business-friendly and quality of life. But those 4 major points are the issues, I think, in our city, and every other great city, probably in the world right now.  And I'm very hopeful that we will get a mayor one of the 2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates that will be well-qualified in that regard."

We are, as they say, loaded up on New York, and we think -- we like our position. I am disappointed that there has not been in this period, unique opportunities to add value by buying distress, which is something that we have been able to do in past cycles. But that's not the way this has worked out. So this has kind of been a weird period. We've gone through a recession, a COVID-caused recession. It really didn't hurt our main businesses, in terms of our occupancies, but it did nick our income by $200 million because certain of our businesses were shut down like signage and garages, et cetera. 
On the other hand, interest -- and the other benefit of that is interest rates are historically low, chronically low. It looks like they're going to be low forever, which is something I think we have to be a little bit thoughtful about before we subscribe to that. But there really hasn't been very much in terms of distress that we've been able to buy, although we've been looking very hard. So I'm disappointed in that, but what is, is. I do believe that the best opportunity that we have for capital in our business, by far and away, is investing in the Penn District, which I think if one has a 5- and even a 10-year view, is going to be one of the great investments and one of the great developments in -- out there.

There is a -- and by the way, this is a very difficult cycle because, in addition to everything else, we have the secular change from brick-and-mortar retailer to internet shopping, which is a secular change, which sort of makes this cycle much deeper. Nonetheless, it's the cycle. So there's lots of vacancies. 
The first thing that happens is that the vacancies are scooped up by a group of tenants who realize the value and who have business models that can operate and thrive with reasonable rents. When the vacancy starts to get to be absorbed, the rents rise. And during the whole process, the highest quality space demand -- commands the highest rents and the highest demand. So that's beginning to happen now. 
And as Haim said a few moments ago, the retailers that have thrived are beginning to recognize that this is the bottom and are beginning to recognize that they want to add and even in New York aggressively add at this price point, the unique, important scarce site. So an example of that is that we did a deal with Fendi on Madison Avenue 57th Street recently. We extended a lease with Tods on Madison Avenue at 60th Street recently. And there's multiple other examples of that. So what's going to happen is -- I wouldn't focus on the spot rent today, that's meaningless. That's the rent that is -- that rent will disappear in a year. And so what's happening is the smart players, the players who have a business model that works are beginning to absorb the good space and that will cause the market to shift. And in a year or 18 months or so, you'll see a totally different market. And in 3 years from now, you'll see a monumentally different market, which will be thriving with much higher rents."

So for example, gaming is an",669,"That's an unanswerable question. The reason I put that in there was, I think that our shareholders have a -- would like to know some of the things that are perking below the surface, even though they may not be that imminent. So for example, gaming is an interesting thing. There are -- everybody that follows New York knows that there are 3 gaming licenses that are yet to be issued in the New York, in the New York Enabling Legislation and that they are targeted for down state. And there's been a fair amount of news about that recently, where so people who are following not our company, but following the basic ebb and flow of stuff in New York knows about this. 
Now those 3 licenses are scheduled to be released in 2023, but there has been a great deal of speculation and press that, that may be accelerated earlier because of the budget deficits, et cetera. The urgency may be offset a little bit because the federal governments close those deficits, but who knows. So we have probably the largest portfolio, and we have been receiving multiple incomings from the gaming industry operators who will be applying for those licenses and competing for those licenses. And so the inquiries that we have gotten have been for Manhattan properties. And it turns out that at consensus that our potential assets are probably the best. We have multiple assets, and they're probably the best suited for this kind of activity. 
So now, I mean, we have -- we realize that there is in the enabling legislation, which was passed 4, 5 or 6 years ago, there's a prohibition against gaming in Manhattan. So that's sort of a disconnect. Why are the operators coming in, in multiple inquiries about our assets when there's a prohibition? So the market is sort of saying, well, maybe that prohibition doesn't make a lot of sense, et cetera. So when you think about it, there's going to be 3 licenses issued. It does make sense that one would be to the east of the Long Island region. One would be to the Westchester region, and then there is the third. 
Well, and as I wrote about this, fairly short was it doesn't make a lot of sense for that third license to be issued in direct competition, the one on Long Island or one in Westchester, and that leaves Manhattan, which may be the golden goose in terms of getting revenue for our school systems and what have you. So it's impossible to predict how this comes out. We have multiple assets that are of high interest to these folks. This is a complicated political process. And all I can say is we're just satisfying incoming interest and we'll see where that goes. But you can discount that to 0 in your spreadsheet. Although if it did happen, it would be financially interesting. We have no, no, no interest in being in the gaming industry or being an operator or anything like that. We are a real estate vendor. That's what we do. 
With respect to the sound space business, it's exactly the same story. We are a real estate vendor. We are not going Hollywood. Although I think some of us would like to have a bit part somewhere, whatever. And we are responding to incomings from an industry, which is a streaming industry, which is unbelievably hot. They have a great deal of interest in being in Manhattan because that's where the talent is. So these are nascent ideas, which I put into the letter because I think our shareholders are entitled to know some of the things that are going on in the background. These will undoubtedly not become large parts of our business, but who knows. 
Just remember, I said, you can look at -- the Penn District, it could be Hollywood, Hollywood East. It won't, for sure, but it's an interesting thing to sort of fantasize about."

And so the state government and the railroads are actively involved in multiple attempts to do that, which involves public money.

Now I agree with you that the folks in various governments -- by the way, the price may come out of Washington in terms of taxation, Albany maybe a second runner here. But the point of it is, is that the loss of some very high earners who are at retirement age, by the way, is something that is happening. It's happening all around the country. It's more -- it's happening more aggressively in California, by the way. And California folks they flee to Texas, and New York folks flee to Florida. 
What I'm saying basically is the backbone of New York is not the 20 or 30 hedge funds trillionaires or billionaires who are going to Florida or wherever. The backbone of New York is the $300,000, $500,000, even $1 million earning management people in their prime, in their 40s who are raising families, et cetera, whose jobs can -- who are not the heads of their businesses and can live anywhere, whose jobs and future depends upon being in New York, where they can do 3x better than they can do anywhere else. As 
long as that -- as long as that holds, New York will be fine. And as we see it, people like JPMorgan Chase building their new headquarters building, et cetera. The businesses that are -- I'm not talking about the entrepreneurs who can live anywhere. And they are a very small number of people, although they're very exponentially important. The mass of the talent that New York has pretty much is staying in New York, has to stay in New York, wants to stay in New York, loves to stay -- loves to live in New York, and has to live in New York because that's where these unique jobs are."

I hope everyone is healthy, continues to be vigilant and gets vaccinated. Let me say it again. Everybody, please get vaccinated. I'll start by sharing a few things that are happening on the ground, which I hope you all find interesting. The U.S. economy is resilient, it's growing. I might even say is booming, and so is New York.  Financial, tech and almost all industries are achieving record results. In New York, apartment occupancy, which had dropped to as low as 70% during COVID, is now rapidly climbing back with record numbers of new leases being signed each week at higher and higher rents. 
Condo sales, which had stalled during COVID, are now active, albeit at discounted pricing, except I'm proud to say that our 220 Central Park South where resales are at a premium. This apartment and condo demand is coming from folks who live and work in New York, and that's a very good sign. At 220 Central Park South, where we are basically sold out, resale pricing is up, and that's an understatement. A recent spectacular example, which is now public, is a 2-floor 12,000 square foot resale that traded at a record-breaking $13,000 per square foot, think about that. 
Our New York office division is now experiencing record incoming RFPs and requests for tours, including for many large and important occupiers who had been on the sidelines during COVID. Glen and his team are very busy. By the way, big tech is now very active looking for more space in the work to take advantage of New York's large, highly educated and diverse workforce. Here's an interesting fact, a Fortune 100 occupier household name who dropped out of the market during COVID has come back to market. They were originally looking for 300,000 square feet to house 2,800 employees. Post-COVID, after extensive study and space planning, they now need and are seeking 400,000 square feet, a 30% increase to house the same 2,800 employees. 
In both instances, their projected in-office occupancy is the same 60%. The fact that this occupier needs 30% more space post-COVID is contrary to all analyst expectations, but that is the fact. And we are hearing the same for many, although not all, but many of our tenants that they will need more space, not less post-COVID. One of our analysts and a friend recently noted that our company suffers from PENN fatigue, true. It took us over a decade to assemble our vast Penn District but as the same goes, this is our time. Here's where we stand. 
At Farley, we have delivered to Facebook all of their 730,000 square feet. Their tenant work is going full bore. The West side of Seventh Avenue, along the 3 blocks stretching from 31st Street to 34th Street, is now a massive construction site, where we are transforming the 4.4 million square foot PENN 1 and PENN 2 into the nucleus of our cutting-edge connected campus. The 34th Street PENN 1 lobby just opened, and our unrivaled 3-level amenity offering will be completed at year-end. 
Our full building PENN 2 transformation, including the bustle and reskinning, is 98% bought out on budget and off to a fair start. We couldn't be more excited. Our 14,000 square foot sales center the Seventh Floor of PENN 1 is now open to reviews from brokers and occupiers. It's busy. It is that -- the sales office is designed as a dealmaking conference and presentation center with multiple building models and videos that tell our story in a clear, persuasive and unique way. 
After working with Glen and Josh in the sales center, the market is understanding our ambitious plans to make the Penn District, the crown jewel of the west side of the new New York. By the way, every quarter and every year, the Westside is punching way above its weight, measured by high and growing leasing share -- market share of leases signed. 
the side of our confidence and the market's enthusiasm, even at this early date, we are raising our PENN asking rents. We will shortly begin demolition of the Hotel Pennsylvania to create the best development site in town. We expect demolition and shutdown costs to be about $150 million, which you should look at as land cost.  Our book basis in this property today is $203 million. And we are midstream in the process to make the unique high-growth Penn District a separate investable public security. 
Our best in the business team leaders in the Penn District are Glen Weiss Leasing, Barry Langer Development and Dave Construction. Michael will cover our operating results in a moment, but I can say that, overall, leasing and occupancy statistics in New York tell a misleading story. While overall availability is 18%, assets newly built or repositioned since 2000 have a much lower direct vacancy rate of 11%. Last quarter, 88% of new leasing activity in Midtown was a Class A product. It's clear that the market is voting for new and repositioned assets. As you would expect, Class A assets command higher pricing than Class B, in fact, 1/3 higher. Obviously, this is the place to be and you should know that substantially all of our assets are repositioned and in this competitive set. 
New York is coming back to life. Residential neighborhoods are bustling, less so the commercial where office utilization is now approximately 23%. Remember, it's August, the vacation month. The largest employers in Manhattan have mandated a return to work by Labor Day or shortly thereafter, some with full staff in office and others with a flexible program allowing some work from home. As I have said before, I do not believe that the office will be threatened by the kitchen table. And I do not believe that even 1 or 2 work from home days per week by some number of a tenant's employees will be a negative to us. 
unable to predict whether it will take a month or a quarter for office buildings to be back to full up and the Canyons to be teaming again. There is no magic date. All that matters is that it will happen soon enough. Last week, we announced that Wegmans, the premier grocer in the Northeast region, is opening its first store in Manhattan at our 770 Broadway replacing And you can bet that we will do several more Manhattan deals with The fact that Wegmans is coming is creating excitement with it at last count, 43 print and broadcast press articles celebrating the Here is an interesting factor. Wegmans expects that as much as 50% of its volume will be from in-home delivery from home delivery. We will be investing $13 million in TIs, leasing commissions and free rent in this long-term lease with a 65% GAAP mark-to-market increase over Kmart's
This quarter, we announced that we exercised a ROFO to acquire our partner's 45% interest in One Park Avenue in a transaction that values the building at $870 million. Based on the in-place floating rate loan, we project 18 million 9 cents per share first year accretion. Last summer, we brought 555 California Street to market for sale and are unable to achieve fair value we withdrew, understandable at the height of COVID with travel restrictions and so forth. 
At that time, we said we will refinance. And this past quarter, we did to the $201.2 million, netting us approximately $467 million at share. We can just carry on the new floating rate loan is almost exactly the same as the old much smaller fixed rate loan. So one might say the $460 million is free money. Ironically, I believe continuing to own this outstanding asset with this superb accretive financing is actually a better outcome. 
In the pricing cost is rising quickly. Over the past many decades, replacement costs with a dip here and there has risen relentlessly. And if past this is prolog, replacement costs will undoubtedly continue to rise as far as the I can see. Replacement cost has always been a key predictor of future value, a rising umbrella lifting all similar real estate values. And New York is the poster child of this phenomenon. 
Here is updated guidance for our retail business. For 2021, we guided cash NOI of $135 million. And now halfway through the year, we expect to do a little bit. For 2022, we guided cash NOI of $160 million, which we For 2023, we announced new cash NOI guidance of not less than $175 million. You should know that, as expected, Swatch exercised determination option for a portion of their space at St. Regis, which is effective March 2023 with a $9 million termination fee. 
The Swatch own Harry Winsenstole will remain under lease through its June 2031 expiry. The guidance above takes account of the Swatch termination. If I were a betting man, and I guess in some ways, I am, I would bet that we have already put in the bottom in New York that the worst of the best stuff is behind us and that New York will get better and better and so will New York real estate in space. In our case, occupancy rate, TIs and pricing have bottomed. Finally, we have a great talented leasing, development and operations team, all thanks to them. Thank you. Now to Michael."

I will start with our second quarter financial results and end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Second quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.69 per share compared to $0.56 for last y",1309,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our second quarter financial results and end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Second quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.69 per share compared to $0.56 for last year's second quarter, an increase of $0.13. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge for you in our earnings release on Page 5 and in our financial supplement on Page 7. 
The  increase was driven by the following items: $0.09 from tenant-related activities, including commencement of certain lease expansions and nonrecurring of straight-line rent write-offs impacting the prior period, primarily JCPenney and New York & Company; $0.02 from lower G&A resulting from our overhead reduction program; and $0.02 from interest expense savings and the start of improvement in our variable businesses, primarily from BMS Queen. 
Our second quarter comparable results are consistent with the fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the beginning of the year as is our overall expectation for the full year. Speaking of our variable businesses, we are beginning to see signs of recovery with a return to normalcy. BMS is nearing pre-pandemic levels. Signage is starting to pick up with healthy bookings in the second half of the year. Our garages are picking up as well and should be fully back in 2022. And finally, we have a number of trade shows scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Other than Hotel Penn's income, we expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses by year-end 2022 with the balance in 2023.  Company-wide same-store cash NOI for the second quarter increased by 0.5% over the prior year second quarter. Our core New York office business was up 3.2%. Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was up 2%. Consistent with prior quarters, our core office business, representing over 85% of the company, continues to hold its own, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. Our retail same-store cash NOI was down 6%, primarily due to JCPenney's lease rejection in July 2020. 
But excluding the impact of JCPenney's lease rejection, the same-store cash NOI for the remaining retail business was up 9.8%. Our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91.1%, down 2 percentage points from the first quarter. This was expected and driven by long expected move-out at 350 Park Avenue and 85 Tenth Avenue as well as 825 Seventh Avenue coming back into service. With the activity we have in our pipeline, this quarter should represent the bottom of our office occupancy, and it should improve quarter-by-quarter from year. Retail occupancy was up slightly to 77.3%. 
Now turning to the leasing markets. Since our last call, the pace of office leasing activity in New York City has picked up each successive month. The vaccination rates high, companies are now fully focused on their return to the office with many returning during the summer and a majority expected back soon after Labor Day. Predictably, the overall sentiment in New York continues to improve as company's return and the office market continues to heal. During the second quarter, leasing volume in Manhattan was its highest since the onset of the pandemic. And office tour activity has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels with more than 11 million square feet of active tenant requirements. 
Importantly, office-using employment in the city continues to strengthen. With more than 100,000 jobs now recovered, we are at 92% of the pre-pandemic peak. While leasing volume during the first half of 2021 was dominated by small to medium-sized transactions, driven by well-capitalized financial services and technology tenants, we are now seeing pent-up demand from larger occupiers across all industry types as many have formally entered the market. There are additional signals that the market continues to 
Tenants are now entering into leases for longer terms and asking rents and concessions have stabilized. And in fact, as Steve alluded to, we have recently increased our asking rents in our top-tier assets, reflecting the strong demand for best-in-class assets. During the second quarter, we signed 33 leases, totaling 322,000 square feet, with 2/3 coming from new companies joining our high-quality portfolio across the city. 
The average starting rent of these transactions was a strong $85 per square foot. The leasing highlight for the quarter was 100,000 square feet at PENN 1, further validating the market's resounding reception to our redevelopment of this property. The largest transaction was a new lease with Empire Health Choice for 72,000 square feet. Our main competition here was newly constructed buildings in both Downtown and Midtown. Our new dramatic lobbies in Plaza's best-in-class campus amenity program and premier access to transportation 
Looking towards the second half of 2021, our leasing pipeline has grown significantly since last quarter with more than 1 million square feet of leases in active negotiation, including 180,000 square feet of new leasing at 85 Tenth Avenue as well as an additional 1.6 million square feet in various stages of discussion. This includes discussions with several large users newly interested in PENN 2 after seeing our vision at the experience center. Our activity is a balanced combination of new and renewal deals with the majority of our activity with companies in the financial, technology and advertising sectors. 
Our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022, with only 976,000 square feet expiring in total, representing 7% of the portfolio, and 150,000 of this square footage is in PENN 1 and PENN 2. As we look toward our 2023 expirations of 1.9 million square feet, of which 350,000 is in PENN 1 and PENN 2, we are, of course, already in dialogue and trading paper with many of these companies and anticipate announcing important transactions by year-end. 
Now turning to theMART in Chicago, where the office market is also showing signs of life, and tenant demand is returning coming out of the pandemic. While short-term renewal leasing dominated the market during 2020, activity has picked up with almost 1 million square feet of new leasing completed during the second quarter, though concessions are unusually high. At theMART, we completed a 91,000 square foot long-term office renewal with 18 71. Chicago's premier technology incubator for entrepreneurs and have an additional 80,000 square feet of new deals in negotiation. 
Two weeks ago, we produced our first trade show at theMART since February 2020 pre-pandemic. The show in partnership with International Casual Furniture Association featured the largest manufacturers of outdoor furniture in the country. Attendance was 10% higher than the same show produced pre-pandemic 2019, and feedback from exhibitors and attendees was very positive. We have 8 upcoming trade shows calendar during the remainder of 2021, including NeoCon in October, the largest show in North America focused on commercial design. So we don't expect the tenants to reach 2019 levels this year. 
In San Francisco at 555, we are finalizing a couple of small, strong leases in our full other than the cube. Turning to the capital markets now. The financing markets are wide open and aggressive for high-quality office companies and buildings, and we are taking advantage of the low coupons. It bears repeating that in May, we upsized our 555 California Street loan from $533 million to $1.2 billion with no additional interest costs. We also reentered the unsecured debt market for the 2 tranche $750 million green bond offering at a blended yield of 2.77%. There was robust demand for our paper, underscoring investor support for our franchise and belief in New York City. We paid off the loan on theMART with the proceeds and added the remainder to our treasury. 
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $4.492 billion, including $2.317 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.175 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

Number one,  you have to remember that real estate cost for these tenants is one of the smallest line items in their P&L. So there are different management teams, different perspectives, okay? So we went through the WeWork experience, where the whole economics were driving the space per capita -- the square footage per capita down from what was 250 square feet per capita before. Now to as low as a super number like 60 okay? Well, that doesn't work. So a lot of this has to do with what the management's philosophy is as to how they're going to treat their employees. 
So number one, from a health point of view, that dictates more space per capita.  And in terms of real estate is a recruiting tool, especially in New York. So a lot of that has to do with the management's vision as to what they want the space to look like and feel like and what kind of experience they want their employees to have. So what I'm saying is just to take a road well, obviously, if 10 people out of 100 are going to work from home, they need 10% less space. That's not true. And so I think it's all over the lot, but what I'm saying is there's a feeling in the marketplace and in the analyst community that it's a certainty that COVID -- that work from home, which was lower square footage requirements by the tenant, that's not true.

Our strategy is that we have a unique, huge 6, 8, 10 block collection of assets of property that surrounds the most important transit hub in the city actually in the country. Our strategy is that we know from the -- we're developers.  We're not just owners with developers. Our strategy in creating assets and redeveloping our assets is that quality is something that the market is willing to pay for and appreciates. So if you look at 2 very prominent examples of what we have done as a business, the Bloomberg building, which we did -- which I did some years ago is extraordinary. It's 15 years into it, and it still is cutting age in terms of the user experience in that building. 
By the way, a lot of that has to do with Mike himself who as a very -- the interior designs are extraordinary. Go to 220 Central Block South where we have achieved something that nobody ever thought could possibly be achieved based upon the quality of the offering that we have given. If you go into the 2 Penn lobby, which just opened 2 weeks ago -- I'm sorry, the 1 Penn lobby, and it's only half opened, whatever you could begin to see what the environment that we're creating, which we think is unique, and we know because of brokers, tours and occupier stores already that the marketplace respects understands what we have done. So we think that, that has an enormous effect our ability to develop, our vision to develop on the value of the assets that we are creating. There's more. 
We also believe in multiple buildings and clusters of buildings so that we can offer the tenant uniqueness that you can't get by going into a single building. I've said this before, and I'd like to say it again. A 300,000-foot tenant and a 600,000-foot building is dead. If that tenant wants another 100,000 square feet, he's going to have to move out or move 5 blocks away. In our complex, which will eventually grow to 10 million, 12 million, maybe even 15 million feet, that 300,000 square foot tenant, Glen will always be able to provide that tenant with what he needs in our complex. So the cluster of buildings interconnected above and below ground is what creates the district, creates the uniqueness and we believe will command a premium in the marketplace."

So if the owner is a single owner or whatever, without the resources of the organization, the vision and the capital, the building is going to stay a crap building, and it will find its own market at much lower rents. And of course, that owner may or may not be able to provide TIs and may or may not be able to keep the building in good repair. So a lot of it depends upon the order and that. 
If the owner is a sophisticated firm and a large owner of multiple buildings, eventually, over time, the buildings will be teardown and there'll be new buildings or whatever or they will take the buildings and make them so that they are fit to be leased at decent rents below the Class A umbrella. So if you get a halfway decent building with a sophisticated capable owner with an organization and a capital base, there will always be a low discount rent market for those buildings. So that's a complicated thing, I don't know. But great locations and the great pieces of land underneath those B and C buildings will over time -- and I'm talking about 20 years be bought up by developers and teardowns. There will not be a huge number of those. There'll be 1 or 2 of those every couple of years."

I hope everyone is healthy, continues to be vigilant and gets vaccinated. Let me say it again. Everybody, please get vaccinated. 
I'll start by sharing a few things that are happening on the ground, which I hope you all find interesting. The U.S. economy is resilient, it's growing. I might even say is booming, and so is New York.  Financial, tech and almost all industries are achieving record results. In New York, apartment occupancy, which had dropped to as low as 70% during COVID, is now rapidly climbing back with record numbers of new leases being signed each week at higher and higher rents. 
Condo sales, which had stalled during COVID, are now active, albeit at discounted pricing, except I'm proud to say that our 220 Central Park South where resales are at a premium. This apartment and condo demand is coming from folks who live and work in New York, and that's a very good sign. 
At 220 Central Park South, where we are basically sold out, resale pricing is up, and that's an understatement. A recent spectacular example, which is now public, is a 2-floor 12,000 square foot resale that traded at a record-breaking $13,000 per square foot, think about that. 
Our New York office division is now experiencing record incoming RFPs and requests for tours, including from many large and important occupiers who had been on the sidelines during COVID. Glen and his team are very busy. By the way, Big Tech is now very active looking for more space in New York to take advantage of New York's large, highly educated and diverse workforce. 
Here's an interesting fact, a Fortune 100 occupier household name who dropped out of the market during COVID has come back to market. They were originally looking for 300,000 square feet to house 2,800 employees. Post-COVID, after extensive study and space planning, they now need and are seeking 400,000 square feet, a 30% increase to house the same 2,800 employees. 
In both instances, their projected in-office occupancy is the same 60%. The fact that this occupier needs 30% more space post-COVID is contrary to all analyst expectations, but that is the fact. And we are hearing the same from many, although not all, but many of our tenants that they will need more space, not less post-COVID. 
One of our analysts and a friend recently wrote that our company suffers from [ PENN ] fatigue, true. It took us over a decade to assemble our vast PENN District hoardings, but as the same goes, this is our time. Here's where we stand. At Farley, we have delivered to Facebook all of their 730,000 square feet. Their tenant work is going full bore. 
The West Side of Seventh Avenue, along the 3 blocks stretching from 31st Street to 34th Street, is now a massive construction site, where we are transforming the 4.4 million square foot PENN 1 and PENN 2 into the nucleus of our cutting-edge connected campus. The 34th Street PENN 1 lobby just opened, and our unrivaled 3-level amenity offering will be completed at year-end. 
Our full building PENN 2 transformation, including the bustle and reskinning, is 98% bought out on budget and off to a fair start. We couldn't be more excited. Our 14,000 square foot sales center the Seventh Floor of PENN 1 is now open to rate reviews from brokers and occupiers. It's busy. It is that -- the sales office is designed as a dealmaking conference and presentation center with multiple building models and videos that tell our story in a clear, persuasive and unique way. 
After working with Glen and Josh in the sales center, the market is understanding our ambitious plans to make the PENN District, the crown jewel of the west side of the new New York. By the way, every quarter and every year, the West side is punching way above its weight, measured by high and growing leasing share -- market share of leases signed. 
The aside of our confidence and the market's enthusiasm, even at this early date, we are raising our PENN asking rents. We will shortly begin demolition of the Hotel Pennsylvania to create the best development site in town. We expect demolition and shutdown costs to be about $150 million, which you should look at as land cost.  Our book basis in this property today is $203 million. And we are midstream in the process to make the unique high-growth PENN District a separate investable public security.
Our best in the business team leaders in the PENN District are Glen Weiss Leasing, Barry Langer Development and [ Dave Mandelbaum ] Construction. Michael will cover our operating results in a moment, but I can say that, overall, leasing and occupancy statistics in New York tell a misleading story. While overall availability is 18%, assets newly built or repositioned since 2000 have a much lower direct vacancy rate of 11%. 
Last quarter, 88% of new leasing activity in Midtown was a Class A product. It's clear that the market is voting for new and repositioned assets As you would expect, Class A assets command higher pricing than Class B, in fact, 1/3 higher. Obviously, this is the place to be and you should know that substantially all of our assets are repositioned and in this competitive set.  
New York is coming back to life. Residential neighborhoods are bustling, less so the commercial [ canyons ] where office utilization is now approximately 23%. Remember, it's August, the vacation month. The largest employers in Manhattan have mandated a return to work by Labor Day or shortly thereafter, some with full staff in office and others with a flexible program allowing some work from home.
As I have said before, I do not believe that the office will be threatened by the kitchen table. And I do not believe that even 1 or 2 work from home days per week by some number of a tenant's employees will be a negative to us.  
I, for one, I'm unable to predict whether it will take a month or a quarter for office buildings to be back to full up and the canyons to be teeming again. There is no magic date. All that matters is that it will happen soon enough. Last week, we announced that Wegmans, the premier grocer in the Northeast region, is opening its first store in Manhattan at our 770 Broadway replacing Kmart. And you can bet that we will do several more Manhattan deals with Wegmans. 
The fact that Wegmans is coming is creating excitement with it at last count, 43 print and broadcast press articles celebrating the announcement. Here is an interesting fact to it. Wegmans expects that as much as 50% of its volume will be from in-home delivery -- appropriately from to home delivery. We will be investing $13 million in TIs, leasing commissions and free rent in this long-term lease with a 65% GAAP mark-to-market increase over Kmart's rent.
This quarter, we announced that we exercised a ROFO to acquire our partner's 45% interest in One Park Avenue in a transaction that values the building at $870 million. Based on the in-place floating rate loan, we project $18 million, $0.09 cents per share first year accretion. 
Last summer, we brought 555 California Street to market for sale and are unable to achieve fair value, we withdrew, understandable at the height of COVID with travel restrictions and so forth.  
At that time, we said we will refinance and this past quarter, we did to the tune of [ $1.2 billion ] netting us approximately $467 million at share. We can just carry on the new floating rate loan is almost exactly the same as the old much smaller fixed rate loan. So one might say the $460 million is free money. Ironically, I believe, continuing to own this outstanding asset with this superb accretive financing is actually a better outcome. 
In New York replacement cost is rising quickly over the past many decades, replacement costs with a dip here and there has risen relentlessly. And if past this is pro-log, replacement costs will undoubtedly continue to rise as far as the eye can see. Replacement cost has always been a key predictor of future value a rising umbrella lifting all similar real estate values. 
And New York is the poster child of this phenomenon. Here is updated guidance for our retail business. For 2021, we guided cash NOI of $135 million. And now halfway through the year, we expect to do a little bit. For 2022, we guided cash NOI of $160 million, which we affirm. For 2023, we announced new cash NOI guidance of not less than $175 million. You should know that, as expected, Swatch exercised the termination option for a portion of their space at St. Regis, which is effective March 2023 with a $9 million termination fee.  
The Swatch owned Harry Winston store will remain under lease through its June 2031 expiry. The guidance above takes account of the Swatch termination. If I were a betting man, and I guess in some ways, I am, I would bet that we have already put in the bottom in New York that the worst of the best stuff is behind us and that New York will get better and better and so will New York real estate in space. In our case, occupancy rate, TIs and pricing have bottomed. 
Finally, we have a great talented leasing, development and operations team, all thanks to them. Thank you. Now to Michael."
312648,691323718,2360971,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our second quarter financial results and end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Second quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.69 per share compared to $0.56 for last y",1316,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our second quarter financial results and end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Second quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.69 per share compared to $0.56 for last year's second quarter, an increase of $0.13. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge for you in our earnings release on Page 5 and in our financial supplement on Page 7. 
The  increase was driven by the following items: $0.09 from tenant-related activities, including commencement of certain lease expansions and nonrecurrent or straight-line rent write-offs impacting the prior period, primarily JCPenney and New York & Company; $0.02 from lower G&A resulting from our overhead reduction program; and $0.02 from interest expense savings and the start of improvement in our variable businesses, primarily from BMS, [ claim ].
Our second quarter comparable results are consistent with the fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the beginning of the year as is our overall expectation for the full year. Speaking of our variable businesses, we are beginning to see signs of recovery with a return to normalcy. BMS is nearing pre-pandemic levels. Signage is starting to pick up with healthy bookings in the second half of the year. Our garages are picking up as well and should be fully back in 2022. And finally, we have a number of trade shows scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Other than Hotel Penn's income, we expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses by year-end 2022 with the balance in 2023.  Company-wide same-store cash NOI for the second quarter increased by 0.5% over the prior year second quarter. Our core New York office business was up 3.2%. Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was up 2%. Consistent with prior quarters, our core office business, representing over 85% of the company, continues to hold its own, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. 
Our retail same-store cash NOI was down 6%, primarily due to JCPenney's lease rejection in July 2020.  But excluding the impact of JCPenney's lease rejection, the same-store cash NOI for the remaining retail business was up 9.8%. Our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91.1%, down 2 percentage points from the first quarter. This was expected and driven by long expected move-out at 350 Park Avenue and 85 Tenth Avenue as well as 825 Seventh Avenue coming back into service. With the activity we have in our pipeline, this quarter should represent the bottom of our office occupancy, and it should improve quarter-by-quarter from here. Retail occupancy was up slightly to 77.3%. 
Now turning to the leasing markets. Since our last call, the pace of office leasing activity in New York City has picked up each successive month. With the vaccination rates high, companies are now fully focused on their return to the office with many returning during the summer and a majority expected back soon after Labor Day.  Predictably, the overall sentiment in New York continues to improve as company's return and the office market continues to heal. 
During the second quarter, leasing volume in Manhattan was its highest since the onset of the pandemic. And office tour activity has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels with more than 11 million square feet of active tenant requirements. 
Importantly, office-using employment in the city continues to strengthen. With more than 100,000 jobs now recovered, we're at 92% of the pre-pandemic peak. While leasing volume during the first half of 2021 was dominated by small to medium-sized transactions, driven by well-capitalized financial services and technology tenants, we are now seeing pent-up demand from larger occupiers across all industry types as many have formally entered the market. There are additional signals that the market continues to [ thaw ].
Tenants are now entering into leases for longer terms and asking rents in concessions have stabilized. And in fact, as Steve alluded to, we have recently increased our asking rents in our top-tier assets; reflecting the strong demand for best-in-class assets. During the second quarter, we signed 33 leases, totaling 322,000 square feet, with 2/3 coming from new companies joining our high-quality portfolio across the city. 
The average starting rent of these transactions was a strong $85 per square foot. The leasing highlight for the quarter was 100,000 square feet at PENN 1, further validating the market's resounding reception to our redevelopment of this property. The largest transaction was a new lease with Empire Healthchoice for 72,000 square feet. Our main competition here was newly constructed buildings in both Downtown and Midtown, our new dramatic lobbies in Plaza's best-in-class campus amenity program and premier access to transportation [indiscernible].
Looking towards the second half of 2021, our leasing pipeline has grown significantly since last quarter with more than 1 million square feet of leases in active negotiation, including 180,000 square feet of new leasing at 85 Tenth Avenue, as well as an additional 1.6 million square feet in various stages of discussion. This includes discussions with several large users newly interested in PENN 2 after seeing our vision at the Experience Center. Our activity is a balanced combination of new and renewal deals with the majority of our activity with companies in the financial, technology and advertising sectors. 
Our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022, with only 976,000 square feet expiring in total, representing 7% of the portfolio, and 150,000 of this square footage is in PENN 1 and PENN 2. As we look toward our 2023 expirations of 1.9 million square feet, of which 350,000 is in PENN 1 and PENN 2, we are, of course, already in dialogue and trading paper with many of these companies and anticipate announcing important transactions by year-end. 
Now turning to theMART in Chicago, where the office market is also showing signs of life, and tenant demand is returning coming out of the pandemic. While short-term renewal leasing dominated the market during 2020, activity has picked up with almost 1 million square feet of new leasing completed during the second quarter, though concessions are unusually high. 
At theMART, we completed a 91,000 square foot long-term office renewal with 1871. Chicago's premier technology incubator for entrepreneurs and have an additional 80,000 square feet of new deals in negotiation. 
Two weeks ago, we produced our first trade show at theMART since February 2020 pre-pandemic. This show in partnership with International Casual Furniture Association featured the largest manufacturers of outdoor furniture in the country. Attendance was 10% higher than the same show produced pre-pandemic 2019, and feedback from exhibitors and attendees was very positive. We have 8 upcoming trade shows calendared during the remainder of 2021, including NeoCon in October, the largest show in North America focused on commercial design, though we don't expect the tenants to reach 2019 levels this year. In San Francisco at 555, we are finalizing a couple of small, strong leases in our [ fall ] other than the cube. 
Turning to the capital markets now. The financing markets are wide open and aggressive for high-quality office companies and buildings, and we are taking advantage of the low all-in coupons. It bears repeating that in May, we upsized our 555 California Street loan from $533 million to $1.2 billion with no additional interest costs. 
We also reentered the unsecured debt market for the 2 tranche $750 million green bond offering at a blended yield of 2.77%. There was robust demand for our paper, underscoring investor support for our franchise and belief in New York City. We paid off the loan on theMART with the proceeds and added the remainder to our treasury. 
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $4.492 billion, including $2.317 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.175 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

At PENN 2, we have daily presentations at the Experience Center. We have RFPs in the door on certain blocks. We are feeling great about it.

I think your firm tends to have a little bit lower or smaller of a lease size in terms of leasing. Obviously, you have a number of bigger tenants, but an average lease size of smaller than 300.

Number one,  you have to remember that real estate cost for these tenants is one of the smallest line items in their P&L. So there are different management teams, different perspectives, okay? So we went through the WeWork experience, where the whole economics were driving the space per capita -- the square footage per capita down from what was 250 square feet per capita before, down to as low as a stupid number like 60 okay? Well, that doesn't work. So a lot of this has to do with what the management's philosophy is as to how they're going to treat their employees. 
So number one, from a health point of view, that dictates more space per capita.  And in terms of real estate is a recruiting tool, especially in New York. So a lot of that has to do with the management's vision as to what they want the space to look like and feel like and what kind of experience they want their employees to have. 
So what I'm saying is just to take a [ row ] well, obviously, if 10 people out of 100 are going to work from home, they need 10% less space, that's not true. And so I think it's all over the lot, but what I'm saying is there's a feeling in the marketplace and in the analyst community that it's a certainty that COVID -- that work from home, which was lower square footage requirements by the tenants, that's not true. Some yes, many no.

Right now, there's a very strange phenomenon, and that is folks who're out in the [ hampers ] getting full pay and enjoying it. That's not going to continue from more than another quarter or 2 or 3. 
So at some point, the people who pay the paychecks are going to insist that they're their gang, their team, their thinkers, their creators are back in the office where they can see them, touch and feel them and interact. 
Now there will always be some work from home or work from anywhere or whatever. There always has. Nobody works a 52-week full 5-day week in the office.

So if you think about it, if -- in the last 1.5 years or so, there was about 3 million square feet of big tech lease, something like that. So if you take a 200 square foot per  capita, what is that 4,500 employees. So the numbers are large. And the beauty of New York is it has the scale to satisfy their aspirations. So the answer is they're growing, they're hiring, and they're going to continue to do that."

Park Avenue is going to reclaim its role as the great boulevard of commerce in the world. 
So we have JPMorgan Chase tearing down a building and rebuilding it with a stupendous headquarters building, which we're familiar with because they're using Norman Foster. So we have -- and their plans have been published. We own the adjacent building to that, 280 Park Avenue, which we're very enthusiastic about. There are 2 other potential -- there's another brand new Foster building up at 55th Street. There's 2 more teardowns and rebuilds that are going to happen in Park Avenue. 
So Park Avenue is going to become what it always should be and that's a premier boulevard of commerce. So all of these parts in the city is not going to be segregated into 1 or 2 submarkets, all submarkets are going to do well. We believe that on a relative basis, the Midtown West market, the PENN District market will do on a relative basis better than the others and will grow faster than the others and we'll have higher demand than the others.

Our strategy is that we have a unique, huge 6, 8, 10 block collection of assets and property that surrounds the most important transit hub in the city actually in the country. Our strategy is that we know from the -- we're developers.  We're not just owners with developers. Our strategy in creating assets and redeveloping our assets is that quality is something that the market is willing to pay for and appreciates. So if you look at 2 very prominent examples of what we have done as a business, the Bloomberg building, which we did -- which I did some years ago is extraordinary. It's 15 years into it, and it still is cutting age in terms of the user experience in that building. 
By the way, a lot of that has to do with Mike himself who as a very -- the interior designs are extraordinary. Go to 220 Central Block South where we have achieved something that nobody ever thought could possibly be achieved based upon the quality of the offering that we have given. 
If you go into the 2 PENN lobby, which just opened 2 weeks ago -- I'm sorry, the 1 PENN lobby, and it's only half opened, whatever you could begin to see what the environment that we're creating, which we think is unique, and we know because of brokers, tourers and occupier stores already that the marketplace respects understands what we have done. So we think that, that has an enormous effect our ability to develop, our vision to develop on the value of the assets that we are creating. There's more. 
We also believe in multiple buildings and clusters of buildings so that we can offer the tenant a uniqueness that you can't get by going into a single building. I've said this before, and I'd like to say it again. A 300,000-foot tenant and a 600,000-foot building is dead, if that tenant wants another 100,000 square feet, he's going to have to move out or move 5 blocks away. In our complex, which will eventually grow to 10 million, 12 million, maybe even 15 million feet, that 300,000 square foot tenant, Glen will always be able to provide that tenant with what he needs in our complex. So the cluster of buildings interconnected above ground and below ground is what creates the district, creates the uniqueness and we believe will command a premium in the marketplace."

So if the owner is a single owner or whatever, without the resources of the organization, the vision and the capital, the building is going to stay a c*** building, and it will find its own market at much lower rents. And of course, that owner may or may not be able to provide TIs and may or may not be able to keep the building in good repair. So a lot of it depends upon the order and there's that. 
If the owner is a sophisticated firm and a large owner of multiple buildings, eventually, over time, the buildings will be teared down and there'll be new buildings or whatever or they will take the buildings and make them so that they are fit to be leased at decent rents below the Class A umbrella. 
So if you get a halfway decent building with a sophisticated capable owner with an organization and a capital base, there will always be a low discount rent market for those buildings. So that's a complicated thing, I don't know. But great locations and the great pieces of land underneath those B and C buildings will over time -- and I'm talking about 20 years be bought up by developers and will be teardowns. There will not be a huge number of those. There'll be 1 or 2 of those every couple of years."

New York City is recovering rapidly. The apartment market is a case in point. It suffered a vicious decline to 70% occupancy. Nothing like that, nothing even close to that has ever happened before. As renters gave up their apartments and the work-from-anywhere period to now having recovered to pre-covid occupancies at even higher than pre-COVID rents. This will go down as the most rapid [indiscernible] with pre-bounded history. 
Public transit utilization rates are picking up and public transportation is, of course, the lifeblood of the city. Restaurants and [indiscernible] venues are literally jam-packed and runway and other cultural venues have reopened. With travel restrictions coming off this month, international tourists will be returning. We can see increased automobile and pedestrian traffic everywhere. Vaccination rates among office workers are at high levels. I'm guessing around 90%. We're hearing unanimously that our tenants want their employees back in the office. [ Everything ] has been climbing. And this week, we are now at 43%. I must admit that our tenants and we are a little frustrated at how long the return to work process is taking, but there is no doubt that we're in office will win over work alone at the kitchen table. 
Key things we are hearing every day are health, wellness, culture, collaboration, purpose, productivity, socialization, all under the mantra of its time to get back to work. While the timing of complete return to the office as each company's hybrid plan are still unknowable, it is clear to me that the office is still and will be the center of work and of success. Importantly, our business is rebounding on a trajectory of recovery and return to growth. 
Michael will cover our operating results in a few moments. We had a very good quarter and feel good about the trend line for the future. Many companies throughout the economy are experiencing a significant post-COVID pickup in activity, and we are as well. Glen and his team are as busy as they have ever been with deals in all of our assets. Citywide, third quarter leasing volume reached its highest level since 2019. Our tenants to our activity and the volume of leasing proposals we are working on, particularly large proposal is robust as companies are thriving and clearly looking to grow, and this heightened activity demonstrates the importance of the office to their businesses. 
With [indiscernible] in New York, its infrastructure and scale and its deep talented and diverse workforce continue to give New York a dramatic competitive advantage. In particular, the tech sector continues to be voracious in their appetite for space in our submarkets. And New York has clearly emerged as the second largest and second most important tech hub in the country.  
Activities in the PENN District are full steam ahead, here's the latest. At Farley, we are targeting opening the [ prove hall ] on the Ninth Avenue entrance by year-end. Facebook's tenant work is proceeding with first employee occupancy scheduled for second quarter 2022. 
At the Moynihan Train Hall, we have completed 22 retail leases. We are gratified and validated that Starbucks reports that if Moynihan -- new Moynihan Train Hall store is trending #1 out of its 190 Manhattan locations. 
In Penn Station, our Long Island Railroad concourse construction is about 1/3 complete. We will now own both sides of this heavily traffic concourse. It will be a big win for us. The 34th Street, half of the Penn lobby is open and it is spectacular. Come take a look. Our unique 3-level world-class amenity offering will open shortly, and the other half of the PENN 1 lobby [ which fronts ] 33rd Street will complete -- will be completed end of first quarter 2022. 
At PENN 2, our full building transformation is well underway, on schedule and on budget, the job is largely bought out. The demolition of Hotel Penn will begin this month, creating the best development site in the city. Both office and retail tenant interest is high in the PENN District with multiple large office users now focused on PENN 2. 
Let me review again our PENN District financing plan. Capital required to complete Farley PENN 1 and PENN 2 is about $1 billion before TIs and that will be paid for entirely from our cash on balance sheet. 
Further, Farley, PENN 1 and PENN 2 are free and clear, unencumbered by any mortgage debt whatsoever. And most importantly, as these great assets come online, they will produce, say, $200 million of incremental additional annual earnings. 
The Manhattan retail market has bottomed. It will take some time for rents to start rising again, but leasing activity and tenant inquiries are certainly picking up as residents, office workers and tourists return to the city. New York is still a most favorite location for retailers  who are on top of their game. Of particular note is our recently announced deal with Wegmans, the premier grocer in our region at 770 Broadway, the Facebook building, replacing Kmart, and that's some big uptick. We also completed retail deals in this quarter with luxury, banks and food tenants. We have now completed the retail retenanting of 595 Madison Avenue, the fuller building with luxury tenants Fendi and Berluti, both LVMH brands and [ Bristol ] and Stefano Ricci.
 
As you know, we sold 3 Madison Avenue Street retail assets this quarter and are contracted to sell 2 SoHo street retail assets in the first quarter of 2022. We still believe in high street retail and believe demand, rents and activity have [ borrowed ]. I'm happy to go into detail and the whys and the wherefores of these sales in Q&A. 
We reaffirm the updated guidance of our retail business discussed in our last earnings call. For 2021, we still expect to do a little better than cash NOI of $135 million. For 2022, the guidance is cash NOI of $160 million. After 2023, we guided cash NOI of not less than $175 million 
Last year, the topic [ visual ] was rent collections. You should know that rent collections are now and have been for a while at essentially 100%. A collections on the limited number of rent deferrals that we granted during the crisis are also running at essentially 100%. The topic [ visual ] today is tenant-employee occupancy rates. 
Company-wide, this week, we are now at 43%, and that rate has been growing nicely since the summer. We are able to harvest lots of information about usage as employees may [indiscernible] and many other operating statistics from our building level technology. Our buildings population by -- Our building is populated by financial types, market makers and traders, enjoy occupancy in the [ 70 ]. Another factoid, the busiest day of each week is Wednesday. And another factoid, the number of unique individual employees who came to work in the month of October was 61%.
Finally, let me spend a minute on sustainability where we can continue to be the leader. Vornado was recently selected as a global sector leader for all office retail diversified [ respondent ] in the 2020 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, or GRESB -- or the GRESB survey. Our GRESB score of 94 was our highest total score to date. We also placed second out of 94 publicly listed real estate companies in the Americas who responded to GRESB, including most of our office peers. [indiscernible] and his team for their leadership. 
Thank you. Now to Michael."
312648,691323621,2421382,"Vornado Realty Trust, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vornado Realty Trust","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our third quarter financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. With the recovery in New York City occurring, as Steve described in his opening remark",1262,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our third quarter financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. With the recovery in New York City occurring, as Steve described in his opening remarks, so is our business and financial results. Third quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.71 per share compared to $0.61 for last year's third quarter, an increase of $0.10 or 16%. The increase would have been 26%, but for the once every 3-year mark real estate tax increase which is largely reimbursed by tenants next year, sort of a timing issue, if you will. 
We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release on Page 5 in our financial supplement on Page 7. The increase was driven by the following items: $0.10 from tenant-related activities, including $0.06 from the commencement of new leases and $0.04 from the nonrecurrence of straight-line rent and tenant receivable write-offs impacting the prior period. $0.04 from the continued improvement in our variable businesses, $0.02 from the acquisition of our partner's 45% interest in One Park Avenue in August and $0.02 from lower G&A resulting from our overhead reduction program last December. 
The total of these increases is partially offset by the following decreases: $0.06 from the already mentioned real estate tax expense accrual due to an increase in the triennial tax assessed value of the mark, which, as I said, will be largely billed back to tenants beginning in January 2022 and $0.02 from an increase in other miscellaneous expenses primarily related to our new preferred issuance, partially offset by interest expense savings. 
Our third quarter comparable results are ahead of the 2020 fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the beginning of the year and on our last earnings call, as is our expectation for this year's fourth quarter. We have several noncomparable items in the quarter as well, which totaled about $0.11 per share of income. 
With respect to our variable businesses, we are continuing to see a recovery as the city returns to normal. Signage is picking up nicely with healthy bookings continuing in the fourth quarter. BMS is now performing near pre-pandemic levels. Our garages should be fully back in 2022. And finally, a number of trade shows have successfully taken place, albeit with lower attendance, primarily due to travel restrictions. Other than Hotel Penn's income we still expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses next year with the full return in 2023. 
Company-wide same-store cash NOI for the third quarter increased by 2.8% over the prior year's third quarter and would have been 8.1%, but for the aforementioned additional real estate tax expense at the mark during the quarter. Our core New York Office business was up 7.6%. Our retail same-store cash NOI was up 14.2%, primarily due to the rent commencement of new leases at 595 Madison Avenue and 4 Union Square South and lower real estate taxes. 
Our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91.6%, up 50 basis points from the second quarter, which we believe represented the bottom for our office occupancy. We expect this figure to keep moving up from here based on the leases we have out for signature and in negotiation. Retail occupancy was consistent with the second quarter at 77.2%. 
Now turning to the leasing markets. New York leasing volume reached its highest volume since the onset of the pandemic with more than 7 million square feet leased during the quarter. Employment growth continues its upward trajectory asking rents and concessions have stabilized for high-quality buildings, even improving in some submarkets and sublease space has begun to be absorbed or removed. The theme of flight to quality has continued. Quality of the asset strength of the landlord and access to transportation, all continue the main focus for tenants coming out of the pandemic, and we are a major beneficiary given the quality of our portfolio and the capital we invested over the past 10 years to redevelop our assets. 
Notably, 65% of the deal volume in the city was new in expansion leases, led by 15 deals in excess of 50,000 square feet. The majority of leasing action is being driven by the tech and financial service industries, which accounted for 60% of all activity. We enjoyed a solid third quarter, signing 27 office leases totaling 757,000 square feet, with average starting rents of $77 per square foot and positive GAAP and cash mark-to-market of 4.2% and 1.4%, respectively. The highlight for the quarter, which also happened to be the largest lease done in the market, was an early lease renewal within our public group for 514,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street. This important transaction reaffirms IPG's commitment to the PENN District and resolves what was our largest 2023 expiration. Importantly, we also executed on a full floor expansion with Google at 85 10th Avenue, increasing their total footprint in the building to just under 300,000 square feet. 
Our buildings which cater to financial service users continue to thrive. During the quarter, deals we completed include 52,000 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, 37,000 square feet at 888 7th Avenue and 19,000 square feet at 650 Madison Avenue. We are busy across our portfolio with more to come. Our leasing pipeline is very strong. We have 1 million square feet of leases in negotiation with an additional 1.5 million square feet trading paper or in advanced discussions. 
Our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022, with only 936,000 square feet expiring in total, representing only 5% of the portfolio and 189,000 of the square feet is in PENN 1 and PENN 2. 2023 office expirations totaled 1.5 million square feet, of which 350,000 is in PENN 1 and PENN 2. This total is down significantly since last quarter due to the Interpublic Group lease renewal. 
Retail leasing activity in the third quarter included 10 leases, totaling 111,000 square feet, with average starting rents of $110 per square foot and positive GAAP and cash mark-to-market of 45.3% and 19.6%, respectively. The largest transaction for the quarter was the previously announced 82,500 square foot lease signed with Wegmans at 770 Broadway. 
In addition, we completed the lease-up of the retail to fuller building with a lease to Stefano Ricci, giving us 4 luxury retailers there with new long-term deals and reflecting the recovering market for the best locations. We also completed deals with Citibank at One Park and Capital One at 731 Lexington, reflecting return of the banks to the marketplace. 
Finally, a word on the capital markets. The investment sales market is picking up again with a couple of recent strong office sales in addition to several other assets now in the market. Investor interest in New York is clearly rebounding as they see the city has bottomed and find the relative value compelling. On the debt side, pricing in the financing markets is as tight as we've ever seen and we continue to be active in refinancing our debt to take advantage of the low rates. In September, we also took advantage of the tighter preferred market to refinance our $300 million, 5.7% perpetual preferred shares with 4.45% issuance of the same size, a very attractive rate for Forever money. Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $4.443 billion, including $2.268 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.175 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I mean, look there has to be accretion in anything that we would buy. Right now, the math is top saeter. So our stock fills in the marketplace, I don't know what it is, probably close to an 8% cap rate. Assets in our -- in the office buildings that we would even consider, all sell at sub-5. So you can't -- that math is top saeter. It makes no sense to buy an asset for 5%. 
And by the way, when you take the capital that's required for these asset services, that's a year-over-year, maybe the cash on cash is 4%, when our stock is selling for 7%. So anything that we would do there would be dilutive to shareholder will. And obviously, we're not going to do that. 
If we saw an empty building, by the way, that we could buy, where we thought we could create a great deal of value, we might do that. So generally speaking, it's very difficult to -- for us to transact and grow right now. 
And so -- but we do have -- on the other side of that, is we do have liquidity. We do have a very, very, very dry powder balance sheet, and we still have great opportunities to accretively spend that capital that's on our balance sheet in the PENN District. So that's our main focus right now. It was in the PENN District. So I'm just sort of doubling down with what Michael said."

I remain committed to the tracker. And let's understand what I remain committed to. I remain committed to allowing our investors to use our stable core business on the one hand and then the PENN District, which is our high-growth development segment of our business and to be able to invest in either of those individually or both of those. We are very, very, very strong believers that we will create enormous values in the PENN District. We will create a district that will command premium pricing, and we couldn't be more excited about it. So I remain committed to it, number one. Number two is we are well along with the paperwork and what have you that would be required to do it -- to the launch. 
We recognize what you said, and that is we are seeing a complete turnover in government and senior government officials. And we have pending matters with them. And so obviously, we're going to maybe slide a little bit as we -- as that goal plays out. We are very, very, very optimistic that the new government leaders at the city and state will be, let me say, how do I say this, will be constructive, will be business friendly, and I recognize that the PENN District is something that requires and demands their attention, and we believe we will get that. They're positive attention. 
The next thing is, I've read in -- amongst the analysts, some skepticism about the idea of separating the PENN District. I'm very surprised at that. There's sort of a -- I'm enthusiastic about this as I haven't been about any project in my career. So I'm having trouble understanding it. Also we have had conversations with multiple real estate investors as opposed to stock investors who share our judgment and my judgment about the potential of the PENN District. So -- but from the point of view of the analyst community, I am almost starting to believe that we are in a show-me mode. So what that means is that we have to knock off some more leasing to be able to service the values. So that's basically what's going on. We have no counterparty in the tracker. We have no timetable. It's going to slide a little bit, not too much, and we think it's going to be smashingly successful."

You have an economy where companies are doing very well in their in growth mode, and that's reflected in our pipeline.

There is in the stock that sit in my mind, the sentiment that nobody -- everybody is confused, uncertain and worried about work from home and how it will affect the CBD office business, okay? We acknowledge that. 
We believe 2 things. Number one, well, actually couple of thing. Number one, we believe in New York, we are seeing in the field that people are committed to New York, they are committed to stay in New York, they're committed to grow in New York. That's for the financial services industry, et cetera, the media industry, the entertainment industry and double and triple for the tech industry because the volume -- the scale of New York can't be replicated anywhere. 
I mean just -- if you just take 2 or 3 of the leading trillion dollar tech firms, the leases they've signed in the last 14, 15 months, they need 15,000 engineers to fill that space. You can't get that in Austin or Nashville or wherever, okay? So the scale of New York is winning the day plus the talent pool. So that's factoid number one. Factoid number 2 is the business leaders that we deal with every day, they understand where for all they're grappling with what their policies are going to be, what the hybrid solutions are going to be 3 days of the office, 4 days in the -- or whatever it is, they know that. They're rapidly as it out. Yet they continue to believe that they need office space, lots of it, in fact, higher quality office space to recruit their talent and retain their talent. So we're finding in the marketplace the economy between actually a very aggressive and robust demand for space from the big boys in each of the major industries and the uncertainty, the skepticism of work from home in the marketplace. So we're betting that our tenants know what they're doing. 
And we think that -- so we think that work from the office will win. It will be nipped around the edges by some hybrid thing, people work from home some number of days a week. But the people -- we talked to everybody, they want the people back in the office. That's the way to grow their businesses and they are really serious about it. So we think that, that's the answer. We are very, very pleased with the demand for space, notwithstanding the uncertainty that's in the securities market."

And fundamentally, we're just seeing more interest from retailers. By the way, that's all submarkets, right? 
The tourist-oriented submarkets, the Fifth Avenue and Times Square, obviously, you would expect to be the ones to come back to last because that's so dependent on tourism. And with that now opening up, retailers want to see it happen. But again, even there, we're seeing inquiry from tenants in both those submarkets. Rents are obviously down. That's inducing demand. And so there's discussions that are underway and an action that's occurring. So that's what gives us, I think, the confidence to make that statement. I think Steve was pretty clear. Activity has to happen before you start getting rental movement, and it's going to take, I think, a decent amount of activity before that happens. So I wouldn't expect rents to rise near term. But once we start getting some pace of transactions, I think that will be a shot in the arm for the market."

And we will buy the highest quality at very attractive prices, and there hasn't been that kind of availability or offering yet. I said -- let me give you a feeling for the 5 assets that we have either sold the contract, to sell what our thinking was, okay? Number one, those assets this year are losing, actually have a negative income of more than $3 million. I think we said in the press release that the occupancy was 30% and the vacancy, therefore, was 70%. That is accurate, of course, but there's one track probably that you have to consider. There is one tenant in those 5 properties that is basically a swing tenant who is rebuilding a store. 
And so if you take that out, and we know for sure that, that tenant is going to leave in a couple of years because it's a swing set. It's not a pop-up. It's a swing set. And so if you take that out, I think the occupancy is 11%. So if you take that into account -- and by the way, if you take the -- so that would make the -- when that goes away, the earnings are -- the negative earnings are greater than $3 million. The capital -- if you add the capital that would be required to lease up those 5 properties. And we have to lease up 90% of them. So it's almost a total lease-up job. You take the time and you take our underwriting as to how long it will take to climb up to a decent return. 
Our judgment was that for our business, it's a proper strategy to sell those assets. And so the proceeds where the assets are unencumbered, there's no debt on the assets, so that will bring in 100 -- I think it's $84 million, $85 million of new cash that we think we can put to better use. 
Now we are selling the measured [ revenue ] assets to a friend. And they are an extremely substantial offshore buyer who have a history of making very intelligent distressed buys. We know that. We respect it and we're friends. We laugh about it to each other. We expect that the buyer, the Madison Avenue properties will make money and have a very satisfactory investment, but it will be in our judgment over a 10-year hole. That time frame made us to be a seller rather than a holder of those assets. So we believe that the buyer will do well, and we think the seller lets us will do well. 
There's one last point. 25 years ago, Madison Avenue was an isolated Oasis in New York. There was one submarket that worked in terms of luxury high-end comp, et cetera, and that was the [ upper sign ]. Over the 25 -- and so obviously, the luxury brands all clustered in Madison Avenue. And Madison Avenue had effectively an oligopoly or a monopoly on luxury shopping in the city of New York because all the customers with -- we've been working business on that and all the tourists basically stayed in Upper East side logic. 
Over the years, that has been diluted enormously so that every submarket, whether it be in Chelsea Or Tribeca or let's fill in towards the upper West side, every submarket now is [ living ] with customers for one of these brands. So obviously, over the years, instead of having one store in Madison Avenue energy, they now have 5 stores. One of the [ meet ] parking, one of [ Chelsea one ] here and there. So Madison Avenue has been diluted enormously. It was that sociodemographic thinking that also led us to be a seller of those assets. And by the way, that thinking is totally different than Fifth Avenue or Times Square, which continue to be enormous attractions."

If you think about Alexanders, Alexander is an externally advised entity, right? The public owns 1/3.

But the reality is the development really just commenced in the last couple of years, right? And it's underway right now with Farley, PENN 1, PENN 2 and, obviously, a lot more behind that. So we've talked about the public owning a portion of it, not all of it, probably less than half of it. And so if you think about it, it's kind of like Alexander's in the sense of that public tracker is sort of an externally advised entity managed by Vornado, very similar to Alexander's. And in terms of the shareholders, that there's no -- the only shareholders that are going to be forced to sell this are some of the index funds. By the way, not all of them, not most of them, but some of them. 
Any investor that is an active investor that makes dedicated decisions about specific companies can continue on both pieces. By the way, they can stop up even more of the trackers. So we talk about this like those 4 sellers. There's no buyers. 
On the other side, we know for a fact there are investors that have tremendous belief in the PENN District, would like to just own the PENN District, like the higher risk, higher reward, believe in what's going on in that part of the city and what we're doing and prefer to own that directly and not with everything else. So there's going to be -- obviously, it will settle out when we distribute it. There'll be some net selling from some of the funds that you alluded to that have to sell. But we also think there is a group of investors that are not in Vornado that will stop up that demand. And our goal is for that to trade very well. And I think your Alexander's analogy come back.

She has an entire career of being supportive of business. She understands what's going on in New York. She understands the PENN District. And we believe that she will be a perfectly fine leader. And other than that, I can't get into it. I want to get back for a moment to Michael's very fine answer to your question about the tracker. There are trade-offs here. In order to create a separate legal entity, a spin-off, for example, which we have done twice before with JBT's [indiscernible] and Urban Edge. We would have to have a totally separate management team, totally separate board, totally separate everything. That's untenable. that's not a doable prospect, and it's untenable, and we can't do it. We need the same people with our leasing and development team, for example, okay? 
And also it would be very -- the additional overhead would be enormous. So the trade-off is that we can use the same team, the same board, the same governance, but we can get investors to be able to invest in whichever part of our company, they want them to or both, okay? So it's interesting, I expect that many investors will continue to hold both securities, which is actually the same thing as if we did nothing in terms of separating the tractor. But at the margin, there will be a new group, as Michael said, of investors who actually have an enormous level of enthusiasm for the west side of New York, for [ PENN ] coming into New York and for what we're doing in the Penn District. And at the margin, we think it will be a very successful investment."

New York City is recovering rapidly. The apartment market is a case in point. It suffered a vicious decline to 70% occupancy.
Nothing like that, nothing even close to that has ever happened before, as renters gave up their apartments in the work-from-anywhere period to now having recovered to pre-COVID occupancies at even higher than pre-COVID rents. This will go down as the most rapid V-shaped rebound in history.
Public transit utilization rates are picking up and public transportation is, of course, the lifeblood of the city. Restaurants and sporting venues are literally jam-packed and Broadway and other cultural venues have reopened. With travel restrictions coming off this month, international tourists will be returning. We can see increased automobile and pedestrian traffic everywhere.
Vaccination rates among office workers are at high levels. I'm guessing around 90%. We're hearing unanimously that our tenants want their employees back in the office. COVID-19 has been climbing. And this week, we are now at 43%. I must admit that our tenants and we are a little frustrated at how long the return-to-work process is taking, but there is no doubt that work in office will win over work alone at the kitchen table.
Key things we are hearing every day are health, wellness, culture, collaboration, purpose, productivity, socialization, all under the mantra of it's time to get back to work. While the timing of complete return to the office and each company's hybrid plan are still unknowable, it is clear to me that the office is still and will be the center of work and of success.
Importantly, our business is rebounding on a trajectory of recovery and return to growth. Michael will cover our operating results in a few moments. We had a very good quarter and feel good about the trend line for the future.
Many companies throughout the economy are experiencing a significant post-COVID pickup in activity, and we are as well. Glen and his team are as busy as they have ever been with deals in all of our assets. Citywide, third quarter leasing volume reached its highest level since 2019.
Our tenants tour activity and the volume of leasing proposals we are working on, particularly large proposal, is robust as companies are thriving and clearly looking to grow, and this heightened activity demonstrates the importance of the office to their businesses.
The dominance of New York, its infrastructure and scale and its deep talented and diverse workforce continue to give New York a dramatic competitive advantage. In particular, the tech sector continues to be voracious in their appetite for space in our submarkets. And New York has clearly emerged as the second largest and second most important tech hub in the country.
Our activities in the Penn District are full steam ahead, here's the latest. At Farley, we are targeting opening The Fuller hall on the Ninth Avenue entrance by year-end. Facebook's tenant work is proceeding with first employee occupancy scheduled for second quarter 2022.
At the Moynihan Train Hall, we have completed 22 retail leases. We are gratified and validated that Starbucks reports that its Moynihan -- its new Moynihan store is trending #1 out of its 190 Manhattan locations. In Penn Station, our Long Island Rail Road Concourse construction is about 1/3 complete. We will now own both sides of this heavily traffic concourse. It will be a big win for us. The 34th Street, half of the PENN1 lobby is open and it is spectacular. Come take a look.
Our unique 3-level world-class amenity offering will open shortly, and the other half of the PENN1 lobby which fronts our 33rd Street will be completed end of first quarter 2022. At PENN2, our full building transformation is well underway, on schedule and on budget, the job is largely bought out. The demolition of Hotel Penn will begin this month, creating the best development site in the city. Both office and retail tenant interest is high the Penn District with multiple large office users now focused on PENN2.
Let me review again our Penn District financing plan. Capital required to complete Farley PENN1 and PENN2 is about $1 billion before TIs and that will be paid for entirely from our cash on balance sheet. Further, Farley, PENN1 and PENN2 are free and clear, unencumbered by any mortgage debt whatsoever. And most importantly, as these great assets come online, they will produce, say, $200 million of incremental additional annual earnings.
The Manhattan retail market has bottomed. It will take some time for rents to start rising again, but leasing activity and tenant inquiries are certainly picking up as residents, office workers and tourists return to the city. New York is still a most favorite location for retailers who are on top of their game.
Of particular note is our recently announced deal with Wegmans, the premier grocer in our region at 770 Broadway, the Facebook building, replacing Kmart, and that's some big uptick. We also completed retail deals in this quarter with luxury, banks and food tenants. We have now completed the retail retenanting of 595 Madison Avenue, The Fuller Building, with luxury tenants Fendi and Berluti, both LVMH brands and [ Krystal ] and Stefano Ricci.
As you know, we sold 3 Madison Avenue street retail assets this quarter and are contracted to sell 2 SoHo street retail assets in the first quarter of 2022. We still believe in high street retail and believe demand, rents and activity have bottomed. I'm happy to go into detail and the whys and the wherefores of these sales in Q&A.
We reaffirm the updated guidance of our retail business discussed in our last earnings call. For 2021, we still expect to do a little better than cash NOI of $135 million. For 2022, the guidance is cash NOI of $160 million. After 2023, we guided cash NOI of not less than $175 million.
Last year, the topic du jour was rent collections. You should know that rent collections are now and have been for a while at essentially 100%. Collections on the limited number of rent deferrals that we granted during the crisis are also running at essentially 100%. The topic du jour today is tenant-employee occupancy rates.
Company-wide, this week, we are now at 43%, and that rate has been growing nicely since the summer. We are able to harvest lots of information about usage as employees wedge-in and many other operating statistics from our building level technology.
Our buildings population by -- our building is populated by financial types, market makers and traders, enjoy occupancy in the 70. Another factoid, the busiest day of each week is Wednesday. And another factoid, the number of unique individual employees who came to work in the month of October was 61%. 
Finally, let me spend a minute on sustainability where we can continue to be the leader. Vornado was recently selected as a global sector leader for all office retail diversified respondent in the 2020 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, or GRESB -- or the GRESB survey.
Our GRESB score of 94 was our highest total score to date. We also placed second out of 94 publicly listed real estate companies in the Americas who responded to GRESB, including most of our office peers. Kudos to Dan Egan and his team for their leadership. Thank you. Now to Michael."

I will start with our third quarter financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. With the recovery in New York City occurring, as Steve described in his opening remark",1259,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our third quarter financial results and then end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. With the recovery in New York City occurring, as Steve described in his opening remarks, so is our business and financial results.
Third quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.71 per share compared to $0.61 for last year's third quarter, an increase of $0.10 or 16%. The increase would have been 26%, but for the once every 3-year Mart real estate tax increase which is largely reimbursed by tenants next year, sort of a timing issue, if you will. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release on Page 5 and our financial supplement on Page 7.
The increase was driven by the following items: $0.10 from tenant-related activities, including $0.06 from the commencement of new leases and $0.04 from the nonrecurrence of straight-line rent and tenant receivable write-offs impacting the prior period. $0.04 from the continued improvement in our variable businesses, $0.02 from the acquisition of our partner's 45% interest in One Park Avenue in August and $0.02 from lower G&A resulting from our overhead reduction program last December.
The total of these increases is partially offset by the following decreases: $0.06 from the already mentioned real estate tax expense accrual due to an increase in the triennial tax assessed value of the Mart, which, as I said, will be largely billed back to tenants beginning of January 2022, and $0.02 from an increase in other miscellaneous expenses primarily related to our new preferred issuance, partially offset by interest expense savings.
Our third quarter comparable results are ahead of the 2020 fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the beginning of the year and on our last earnings call, as is our expectation for this year's fourth quarter. We have several noncomparable items in the quarter as well, which totaled about $0.11 per share of income.
With respect to our variable businesses, we are continuing to see a recovery as the city returns to normal. Signage is picking up nicely with healthy bookings continuing in the fourth quarter. BMS is now performing near pre-pandemic levels, our garages should be fully back in 2022.
And finally, a number of trade shows have successfully taken place, albeit with lower attendance, primarily due to travel restrictions. Other than Hotel Penn's income, we still expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses next year with the full return in 2023.
Company-wide same-store cash NOI for the third quarter increased by 2.8% over the prior year's third quarter and would have been 8.1%, but for the aforementioned additional real estate tax expense at the Mart during the quarter. Our core New York Office business was up 7.6%. Our retail same-store cash NOI was up 14.2%, primarily due to the rent commencement on new leases at 595 Madison Avenue and 4 Union Square South and lower real estate taxes.
Our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91.6%, up 50 basis points from the second quarter, which we believe represented the bottom for our office occupancy. We expect this figure to keep moving up from here based on leases we have out for signature and in negotiation. Retail occupancy was consistent with the second quarter at 77.2%.
Now turning to the leasing markets. New York leasing volume reached its highest volume since the onset of the pandemic with more than 7 million square feet leased during the quarter. Employment growth continues its upward trajectory. Asking rents and concessions have stabilized for high-quality buildings, even improving in some submarkets and sublease space has begun to be absorbed or removed. The theme of flight to quality has continued.
Quality of the asset, strength of the landlord and access to transportation, all continue to be main focus for tenants coming out of the pandemic, and we are a major beneficiary given the quality of our portfolio and the capital we invested over the past 10 years to redevelop our assets.
Notably, 65% of the deal volume in the city was new in expansion leases, led by 15 deals in excess of 50,000 square feet. The majority of leasing action is being driven by the tech and financial service industries, which accounted for 60% of all activity. We enjoyed a solid third quarter, signing 27 office leases totaling 757,000 square feet, with average starting rents of $77 per square foot and positive GAAP and cash mark-to-market of 4.2% and 1.4%, respectively.
The highlight for the quarter, which also happened to be the largest lease done in the market, was an early lease renewal with Interpublic Group for 514,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street. This important transaction reaffirms IPG's commitment to the Penn District and resolves what was our largest 2023 expiration. Importantly, we also executed on a full floor expansion with Google at 85 10th Avenue, increasing their total footprint in the building to just under 300,000 square feet.
Our buildings which cater to financial service users continue to thrive. During the quarter, deals we completed include 52,000 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, 37,000 square feet at 888 7th Avenue and 19,000 square feet at 650 Madison Avenue. We are busy across our portfolio with more to come. Our leasing pipeline is very strong. We have 1 million square feet of leases in negotiation with an additional 1.5 million square feet trading paper or in advanced discussions.
Our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022, with only 936,000 square feet expiring in total, representing only 5% of the portfolio and 189,000 of the square feet is in PENN1 and PENN2. 2023 office expirations totaled 1.5 million square feet, of which 350,000 is in PENN1 and PENN2. This total is down significantly since last quarter due to the Interpublic Group lease renewal.
Retail leasing activity in the third quarter included 10 leases, totaling 111,000 square feet, with average starting rents of $110 per square foot and positive GAAP and cash mark-to-market of 45.3% and 19.6%, respectively. The largest transaction for the quarter was the previously announced 82,500 square foot lease signed with Wegmans at 770 Broadway.
In addition, we completed the lease-up of the retail to Fuller Building with a lease to Stefano Ricci, giving us 4 luxury retailers there with new long-term deals and reflecting the recovering market for the best locations. We also completed deals with Citibank at One Park and Capital One at 731 Lexington, reflecting the return of the banks to the marketplace.
Finally, a word on the capital markets. The investment sales market is picking up again with a couple of recent strong office sales in addition to several other assets now in the market. Investor interest in New York is clearly rebounding as they see the city has bottomed and find the relative value compelling.
On the debt side, pricing in the financing markets is as tight as we've ever seen and we continue to be active in refinancing our debt to take advantage of the low rates. In September, we also took advantage of the tighter preferred market to refinance our $300 million, 5.7% perpetual preferred shares with a 4.45% issuance of the same size, a very attractive rate for Forever money.
Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $4.443 billion, including $2.268 billion of cash and restricted cash and $2.175 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

As you know, there's been very little that's transacted for probably the first 12 months of the pandemic. And frankly, with short-term rates at basically 0 and long-term rates quite low as well, there's been very little pressure on sellers. So you've seen very little transaction activity.
You're starting to see that pick up now with assets being brought out. And to date, the buyer universe, I would say, has generally been driven by players that use higher leverage, although we're still in the early days. So to the extent we see compelling opportunities, we would act on those. So far, the pricing has frankly not been compelling.
And as we compare both to what we're doing in Penn and prospectively what we can do in Penn, those continue to be more attractive than just buying another asset that we're going to stabilize at a 5% yield after spending a lot of money and capital to lease it up or just to buy it.
So we look -- we're going to continue to look. If we find something interesting, we would certainly act on it. We have the capital to do that. But to date, capital continues to price assets quite aggressively, notwithstanding the volume of activity that's still down."

So you can't -- that math is topsy-turvy. It makes no sense to buy an asset for 5%. And by the way, when you take the capital that's required for these asset services, that's year-over-year, maybe the cash on cash is 4%, when our stock is selling for 7%.
So anything that we would do there would be dilutive to shareholder will. And obviously, we're not going to do that.

So generally speaking, it's very difficult to -- for us to transact and grow right now.

So maybe just give us a little bit of an update where you are internally in terms of preparing all the financials and getting all of that done and also externally with a lot of new governmental partners coming in to new seats?

I remain committed to the tracker. And let's understand what I remain committed to. I remain committed to allowing our investors to use between our stable core business on the one hand, and then the Penn District, which is our high-growth development segment of our business and to be able to invest in either of those individually or both of those.
We are very, very, very strong believers that we will create enormous values in the Penn District. We will create a district that will command premium pricing, and we couldn't be more excited about it. So I remain committed to it, number one. 
Number two is we are well along with the paperwork and what have you that would be required to do it -- to launch. We recognize what you said, and that is we are seeing a complete turnover in government and senior government officials. And we have pending matters with them.
And so obviously, we're going to maybe slide a little bit as we -- as that goal plays out. We are very, very, very optimistic that the new government leaders at the city and state will be, let me say, how do I say this, will be constructive, will be business friendly, and I recognize that the Penn District is something that requires and demands their attention, and we believe we will get that. They're positive attention.
The next thing is, I've read in -- amongst the analysts, some skepticism about the idea of separating the Penn District. I'm very surprised at that. There's sort of a -- I'm as enthusiastic about this as I've ever been about any project in my career. So I'm having trouble understanding it. Also we have had conversations with multiple, multiple real estate investors as opposed to stock investors who share our judgment and my judgment about the potential of the Penn District.
So -- but from the point of view of the analyst community, I am almost starting to believe that we are in a show-me mode. So what that means is that we have to knock off some more leasing to be able to service the values. So that's basically what's going on. We have no counterparty in the tracker. We have no timetable, it's going to slide a little bit, not too much, and we think it's going to be smashingly successful."

We can go through the list of things you've called it, the big kahuna, a lot of other things. I think it is similar to the same business that you are in, even though I would concur with your phrasing that you have core assets in this big development opportunity. I think trackers have typically been used where it's a business that is different than the parent company and has other comps or other things in there in terms -- to highlight that value.
Your comments about the private market are much more akin to where I think investors sort of want to be able to highlight that value. But to your point, you don't want to give up a part of that project to a private, that's going to make all the money versus something that you believe should endure to Vornado shareholders?

But as we look at the pipeline, I mean, there is activity literally at every building all types of users. I mean, Steve commented on the voracious appetite of tech is stronger now than it was pre-COVID. And the financial types are booming. We're seeing heavy activity there. You have an economy where companies are doing very well, they are in growth mode, and that's reflected in our pipeline.
So I think the leasing market is sending a very strong signal that New York is going to be fine. New York is going to be one of the winners. Companies want to locate here. And I think you're going to see those stats continue to get posted over the next several quarters. Obviously, this quarter was a good start, but there's much more in the queue across our portfolio."

There is in the stock, the -- in my mind, the sentiment that nobody -- everybody is confused, uncertain and worried about work from home and how it will affect the CBD office business, okay? We acknowledge that.
We believe 2 things. Number one -- well, actually couple of thing. Number one, we believe in New York, we are seeing in the field that people are committed to New York, they are committed to stay in New York, they're committed to grow in New York. That's for the financial services industry, et cetera, the media industry, the entertainment industry and double and triple for the tech industry because the volume -- the scale of New York can't be replicated anywhere.
I mean just -- if you just take 2 or 3 of the leading trillion-dollar tech firms, the leases they've signed in the last 14, 15 months, they need 15,000 engineers to fill that space. You can't get that in Austin or Nashville or wherever, okay? So the scale of New York is winning the day, plus the talent pool. So that's factoid #1.
Factoid #2 is the business leaders that we deal with every day, they understand work for all, they're grappling with what their policies are going to be, what the hybrid solutions are going to be, 3 days in the office, 4 days in the -- whatever it is, they know that. They're grappling with it now. Yet they continue to believe that they need office space, lots of it, in fact, higher-quality office space to recruit their talent and retain their talent.
So we're finding in the marketplace the economy between actually a very aggressive and robust demand for space from the big boys in each of the major industries and the uncertainty, the skepticism of work from home in the marketplace. So we're betting that our tenants know what they're doing. And we think that -- so we think that work from the office will win. It will be nipped around the edges by some hybrid thing, people work from home some number of days a week.
But the people -- we talked to everybody, they want the people back in the office. That's the way to grow their businesses and they are really serious about it. So we think that, that's the answer. We are very, very pleased with the demand for space, notwithstanding the uncertainty that's in the securities market."

So our expectation is that we're going to put on a full set of trade shows next year. We're going to see a substantial recovery. I think just being realistic, we don't think trade shows come back fully in '22. It's probably '23 before that fully stabilizes. But in 2021, overall trade shows don't contribute a lot to our variable businesses as we currently project. And next year, we think the number will be several million dollars incremental.
I don't want to give you a number today, just because we need to spend a little time with our team refining that.

Obviously, there were a few people on the streets. Vacancy was high and not much was going on. Right now the transaction machine is working again, people are back out on the streets. 
You're seeing tourism pick up, albeit it's all been domestic so far. International tourism will kick off actually in the next week, which should be another shot in the arm for the city. And we don't expect to snap back to 60 million people immediately, but that's the trend line from the city being opening and the attendance that -- at sporting events and Broadway shows and other things is quite good and quite indicative of what we think is going to happen.
So retailers want to know there are shoppers out there. And there are clearly shoppers out there again. And we've talked about the flight to quality in the best locations, and that's continuing to occur. We've been a beneficiary of that at a place like a Fuller, for example. At a place like a 770, which is a prime spot for Wegmans to go to. And fundamentally, we're just seeing more interest from retailers. By the way, that's all submarkets, right?
The tourist-oriented submarkets, the Fifth Avenue and Times Square, obviously, you would expect to be the ones to come back the last because that's so dependent on tourism. And with that now opening up, retailers wanted to see it happen. But again, even there, we're seeing inquiry from tenants in both those submarkets. Rents are obviously down. That's inducing demand. And so there's discussions that are underway and an action that's occurring.
So that's what gives us, I think, the confidence to make that statement. I think Steve was pretty clear. Activity has to happen before you start getting rental movement, and it's going to take, I think, a decent amount of activity before that happens. So I wouldn't expect rents to rise near term.

The retailers, hotels, airlines, et cetera, or I mean the suffering was monumental. So the first reaction from the retailers was to go into a shell, stop everything and shed liability. So the market went stone cold for the better part of 2 years.
People are now understanding that there is life after it. People are succeeding, the better retailers are actually flying from the pent-up demand, and we are seeing a very, very robust pickup in interest and demand. We are not seeing an aggressive increase in pricing that people are willing to pay. So we're bottomed, we're in a recovery. We are budgeting and underwriting that the recovery will be slow paced."

We are certainly probably the most expert in retails around. And we will buy the highest quality at very attractive prices, and there hasn't been that kind of availability or offering yet. I said -- let me give you a feeling",650,"We certainly are open to buy. We are certainly probably the most expert in retails around. And we will buy the highest quality at very attractive prices, and there hasn't been that kind of availability or offering yet. I said -- let me give you a feeling for the 5 assets that we have either sold the contract, that's what our thinking was, okay?
Number one, those assets this year are losing, actually have a negative income of more than $3 million. I think we said in the press release that the occupancy was 30% and the vacancy, therefore, was 70%. That is accurate, of course, but there's one track that you have to consider. There is one tenant in those 5 properties that is basically a swing tenant who is rebuilding a store.
And so if you take that out, and we know for sure that, that tenant is going to leave in a couple of years because it's a swing set. It's not a pop-up. It's a swing tenant. And so if you take that out, I think the occupancy is 11%. So if you take that into account -- and by the way, if you take the -- so that would make the -- when that goes away, the earnings are -- the negative earnings are greater than $3 million.
The capital -- if you add the capital that would be required to lease up those 5 properties. And we have to lease up 90% of them. So it's almost a total lease-up job. You take the time and you take our underwriting as to how long it will take to climb up to a decent return.
Our judgment was that for our business, it's a proper strategy to sell those assets. And so the proceeds where the assets are unencumbered, there's no debt on the assets, so that will bring in 100 -- I think $84 million, $85 million of new cash that we think we can put to better use.
Now we are selling the Madison Avenue assets to a friend. And they are an extremely substantial offshore buyer who have a history of making very intelligent distressed buys. We know that, we respect it and we're friends. We laugh about it to each other.
We expect that the buyer of the Madison Avenue properties will make money and have a very satisfactory investment, but it will be in our judgment over a 10-year hole. That time frame made us to be a seller rather than a holder of those assets. So we believe that the buyer will do well, and we think the seller, that's us, will do well.
There's one last point. 25 years ago, Madison Avenue was an isolated oasis in New York. There was one submarket that worked in terms of luxury high income, et cetera, and that was the Upper East Side. Over the 25 -- and so obviously, the luxury brands all clustered in Madison Avenue. And Madison Avenue had effectively an oligopoly or a monopoly on luxury shopping in the city of New York because all the customers live within walking distance of that and all the tourists basically stay in Upper East Side largely.
Over the years, that has been diluted enormously so that every submarket, whether it be in Chelsea or Tribeca or West Village or the Upper West side, every submarket now is thriving with customers for one of these brands. So obviously, over the years, instead of having one store in Madison Avenue, they now have 5 stores. One in the meat market, one in Chelsea, one here and there.
So Madison Avenue has been diluted enormously. It was that sociodemographic thinking that also led us to be a seller of those assets. And by the way, that thinking is totally different than Fifth Avenue or Times Square, which continue to be enormous attractions."

If you think about Alexander's, Alexander's is an externally advised entity, right? The public owns 1/3. That stock has done -- when you look at it from the time that development really convinced substantially in that company has done extraordinarily well.
And so I think the corollary here is actually quite similar, right, where -- we're in the -- yes, we've been talking about it for a long time. But the reality is the development really just commenced in the last couple of years, right? And it's underway right now with Farley, PENN1, PENN2 and, obviously, a lot more behind that. 
So we've talked about the public owning a portion of it, not all of it, probably less than half of it. And so if you think about it, it's kind of like Alexander's in the sense of that public tracker is sort of an externally advised entity managed by Vornado, very similar to Alexander's.
And in terms of the shareholders, that there's no -- the only shareholders that are going to be forced to sell this are some of the index funds. By the way, not all of them, not most of them, but some of them. Any investor that is an active investor that makes dedicated decisions about specific companies can continue on both pieces. By the way, they can sop up even more of the trackers. So we talk about this like there's 4 sellers, there's no buyers.
On the other side, we know for a fact there are investors that have tremendous belief in the Penn District, would like to just own the Penn District, like the higher risk, higher reward, believe in what's going on in that part of the city and what we're doing and prefer to own that directly and not with everything else. So there's going to be -- obviously, it will settle out when we distribute it. There'll be some net selling from some of the funds that you alluded to that have to sell.
But we also think there is a group of investors that are not in Vornado that will sop up that demand. And our goal is for that to trade very well. And I think your Alexander's analogy come back, that is a very good analogy in terms of the trajectory of that company once the development commenced."

Other than that, I can't get into it.
I want to get back for a moment to Michael's very fine answer to your question about the tracker. There are trade-offs here. In order to create a separate legal entity, a spin-off, for example, which we have done twice before with JBG Smith and Urban Edge, we would have to have a totally separate management team, totally separate board, totally separate everything.
That's untenable. That's not a doable prospect, and it's untenable, and we can't do it. We need the same people with our leasing and development team, for example, okay? And also it would be very -- the additional overhead would be enormous. So the trade-off is that we can use the same team, the same Board, the same governance, but we can get investors to be able to invest in whichever part of our company they want to or both, okay?
So it's interesting, I expect that many investors will continue to hold both securities, which is actually the same thing as if we did nothing in terms of separating the tracker. But at the margin, there will be a new group, as Michael said, of investors who actually have an enormous level of enthusiasm for the west side of New York, for Penn coming into New York and for what we're doing in the Penn District.

And there may be other opportunities with Wegmans and the rest of our portfolio."
