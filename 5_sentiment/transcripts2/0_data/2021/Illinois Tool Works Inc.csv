The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. From my perspective, the highlights are that Q4 revenues got back to year ago levels despite Food Equipment being down 17%. And that operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 record for the company.
It was a pretty solid finish to a year that, needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021. While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built in home over the past 8 years through the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did.
Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we were focused the entire company and only 2 core imperatives: A, to protect the health safety and well-being of our people; and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence. And in my view, we executed extremely well on both.
Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in support of these 2 key pandemic priorities. Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring. And there's no question that we differentiated ourselves with many of our key customers. As a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts.
We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we thought through how we should manage the company through the pandemic. Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress tested the company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past 8 years, have resulted in a very strong and very company. And then as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down. That for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long term.
This conclusion led to 2 key decisions that we made regarding how we were going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis. First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last 8 years to reinforce our commitment to our people. First, by providing full compensation and benefit support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe, and by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprise-wide employment reduction mandates or programs at any point in 2020. These were not obvious or easy decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances, but we believe that they were the right decisions for our company. And I know that our people will remember them. These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3. 
Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our win and recovery agenda and mindset across the company when the recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy. What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic.
When the recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic, as across the company, we had to read and react to the realities of the near-term situation as we always do. But it does mean that we are committed to protecting key investments supporting the execution of our long-term strategy and that we have, from very early on, given our divisional leadership teams the mandate to continue to think long term, and to remain aggressive through the pandemic. For 2021, our recovery posture and mindset continues on and serves as the central thing driving the 2021 operating plans for everyone of our 83 divisions.
Before I turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q4 performance and our 2021 guidance, let me close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional performance and dedication in the face of the most challenging and unprecedented circumstances of the past year. The performance that they delivered in 2020 provides another proof point that ITW is a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, resilience and agility necessary to deliver consistent top-tier performance in any environment.
Like many of you, I'm sure, we are hopeful for a return to somewhere in the vicinity of normal at some point in 2021. And with that, getting back to giving our full attention to taking ITW all the way for the company's full potential. Between now and whenever that is, we will continue to leverage the full breadth of ITW's capabilities and competitive advantages to keep our people safe, continue to serve our customers with excellence and execute our long-term enterprise strategy.
Michael, over to you."

Please turn to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see solid recovery of progress in many of the end markets that we serve, as evidenced by our revenue being up sequentially 5% versus the third quarter. The increase is 8% when you adjust for equal number of days when historically, our revenue per day has increased by 1% from Q3 to Q4. Overall, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion; operating income of $883 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year; operating margin of 24.4%; free cash flow of $705 million and GAAP EPS of $2.02. After-tax return on invested capital improved to 32%. And as Scott mentioned, operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were fourth quarter records for the company.
Revenue in all major geographies improved sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, North America organic revenue declined 3%, international revenue grew 1%, Europe was down 2%. Similar to Q3, China was a bright spot with 11% growth.
As we've talked about before, the operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, also applies to a cost structure, which was on full display through our operating margin performance in Q4. We improved operating margin by 170 basis points to 25.4%, the second highest margin rate in a quarter in the history of the company. And like I said, grew operating income 7% to $883 million, the highest fourth quarter ever.
The biggest driver of our margin improvement remains our enterprise initiatives, as the ITW team executed on projects and activities that contributed 130 basis points in Q4. the impact was broad-based with all segments delivering enterprise initiative benefits in the range of 80 to 170 basis points.
GAAP EPS was $2.02, up 2%, but keep in mind that Q4 last year had $0.11 of onetime gains from divestitures. If you exclude those gains, EPS was up 7%, the same as operating income.
Working capital performance was excellent, and free cash flow of $705 million was solid with a conversion rate of 110% of net income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 22.1%, down slightly from last year.
In summary, a strong finish to a challenging year and very good momentum as we head into 2021.
Let's move to Slide 5 to review fourth quarter's recovery and response by segment. We updated this slide from our last earnings call with Q4 information. And you can see that our segments continue to respond effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenue and operating margin. I will just highlight a few things to illustrate the resilience and adaptability of our businesses.
You can see the rapid recovery in our end markets relative to the Q2 bottom down 27%. In Q4, 3 of our segments experienced demand levels that were higher than a year ago. The most pronounced recovery has been in automotive OEM, which has more than doubled since Q2 and grew 8% year-over-year in Q4 as did Construction products.
Polymers & Fluids grew 7%, while demand in 3 segments, test and measurement and electronics, welding and specialty products was only slightly lower year-over-year. As you would expect, Food Equipment continues to be impacted by the effect of the pandemic, although we are seeing some sequential improvement. Overall, you can see the benefit of having a high-quality, diversified portfolio and the fact that we're back to demand levels of a year ago, with total revenue essentially flat year-over-year despite one of our core segments being down organically by 19%.
On the right side of the page, you can see the operating flexibility that I just talked about and how it also applies to our cost structure and ultimately shows up in our operating margin performance. At the bottom, in Q2, we still delivered solid operating margins of 17.5%, and only 2 segments were below 20%.
In Q4, we're almost 800 basis points higher at 25.4% despite no volume growth year-over-year, and every segment is back above 22%, including Food Equipment, as 6 out of 7 segments achieved record fourth quarter operating margins.
Let's move on to Slide 6 for a closer look at individual segment performance, starting with automotive OEM. The team continued to execute exceptionally well from a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to customer demand levels that have more than doubled since Q2. In Q4, organic growth of 8% year-over-year was the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2017. While North America was flat in Q2, it was more than offset by strong demand in Europe, which grew 10% and in China, which grew 20%.
As expected, Food Equipment end markets remained challenged in Q4. Organic revenue was down 19%, a little better than the third quarter. And demand in Q4 was similar to Q3 when you look at it by geography and the end markets. North America was down 20%, International down 18%, equipment sales were down 20% and service was down 18%. Institutional demand was down about 30% with restaurants down a little bit more than that. And not surprisingly, the bright spot throughout the year continue to be retail with organic growth of 8%.
Moving to Slide 7 for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Q4 organic revenue declined 3% with Test & Measurement down 8% against a tough comparison of plus 6% in Q4 '19. Electronics was up 3%. And while demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, segment benefited from considerable strength in several end markets, including semiconductor, health care and clean room.
As you may have seen on January 19, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with -- to acquire MTS' Test & Simulation business. The Test & Simulation business is very complementary to our business, which we highlighted during our 2018 Investor Day, and some of you may have visited our facility outside of Boston. MTS' Test & Simulation business has similar organic growth potential, and there's substantial opportunity for margin improvement through the application of the ITW business model.
Pre-COVID revenues in fiscal year 2019 were $559 million with operating margin of 6%. We expect to get the business to generate ITW caliber operating margins by the end of year 5, and generate after tax ROIC in the high teens by the end of year 10.
As you saw in the announcement, we expect the acquisition to close in the middle of 2021 and we're very much looking forward to welcoming the MTS' Test & Simulation team to the ITW family.
Moving on, please turn to Slide 8, in welding, with meaningful pickup in demand as organic revenue improved from being down 10% year-over-year in Q3, totally being down 2% in Q4. Our commercial business, which primarily serves smaller businesses and individual users and accounts for 35% of the revenue in this segment remained strong and grew 12% year-over-year. Our Industrial business showed signs of strong recovery from being down 23% in Q3 to down only 5% in Q4 as customer activity and equipment orders gained strength. Overall, Organic revenue for equipment was flat versus prior year and much improved versus a 10% decline in the third quarter. 
Polymers & Fluids delivered strong organic growth of 7% with fluids up 16% with continued strong demand in end markets related to health care and hygiene. The Automotive Aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales with organic growth of 5% and  Polymers grew 4% with solid demand for MRO and automotive applications.
Moving to Slide 9. Construction continued to benefit from strong demand in the home center channel and delivered organic growth of 8% in Q4. Growth was strong across all geographies, with North America up 10% double-digit growth in the Residential Renovation market, offset by commercial construction, which represents only about 15% of North America revenue, down 11%. Europe grew 9% and Australia and New Zealand grew 5% due to strong retail sales. 
Specialty Organic revenue was down 3% this quarter, North America down 2% and International revenue down 4%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid but was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses.
So that concludes the segment commentary, and let's move on to the full year 2020 summary results on Slide 10. And in the face of unprecedented challenges that included 10 customer shutdowns across wide swaths of our end markets during the year, organic revenue was down 10%. Still, we delivered operating income of $2.9 billion, and highly resilient operating margin of 22.9%, only down 120 basis points year-over-year, despite no major cost takeout initiatives on mandates and with a strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives. After-tax ROIC was 26.2% and free cash flow was $2.6 billion.
Throughout the pandemic, one of our priorities was to maintain our financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality. And as you can see, we did just that in 2020. ITW's balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity. We did not have a need to issue any debt of commercial paper in 2020. And we ended the year with total debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 2.5x, which was only slightly above our 2.25x target. At year-end, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
With 2020 behind us, let's move to Slide 11 for a discussion of our guidance for 2021. So starting with the caveat that we continue to operate in a fairly uncertain economic environment, we have based our guidance, as we always do, on the current levels of demand in our businesses. Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level.
Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and adds 2 percentage points to revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%.
At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint. We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year midpoint.
Enterprise initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021 as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year.
We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment, embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals. Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income. 
I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021. Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses. Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third priority are selective, high-quality acquisitions that supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential.
I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only. After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021.
In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders, and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021. We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%.
Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year. And instead, focus our time, and efforts on the recovery in 2021. While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given their expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022.
Let's turn to Slide 12 and the forecast for organic growth by segment. With the caveat again that the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment. And based on the current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021. At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%.
To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built over the past 8 years through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any environment.
Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year. And our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.
With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you."

And we're, as we sit here today, the low end is food equipment at 22, and the high end is welding at 29. very different range from when we started the strategy 8 years ago. And I think the fact that we have businesses delivering margins in the high 20s just gives us further confidence in the long-term goals that we've laid out for the company.
So the big driver in '21 remains enterprise initiatives. Those are broad-based in every segment. We'll make progress on 80/20 in strategic sourcing. And certainly, we expect also a meaningful contribution from volume leverage as we go through the year here. But I wouldn't single any segment out as having more margin improvement potential than others. I think we expect all of our segments to continue to make progress towards their full potential."

It is possible though that we may see some production slowdown here in Q1 at some of our customers. Whether that will impact the demand -- their demand for our products, I think, remains to be seen. We view this right now as more of a timing issue. And so certainly, this could put a little bit of pressure on the Auto business here in the first quarter. But as we sit here today, we would have assumed that we're going to catch that up in Q2 or the second half of the year.
In terms of the quarterly cadence for the Auto business, I think you saw the strong performance here in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Like I said, we've not seen anything to suggest that demand is slowing down when we're looking at the January results. So we expect given how we've planned the business to be off to a pretty good start with positive organic growth and margin improvement in the first quarter, that typically -- sequentially that builds as we go through the year. Q2 will be, as Scott said, the biggest quarter and the second half, the comps start to get a little bit more challenging. The build numbers are a little bit different. But that's probably as much as I can give you on the Automotive business and kind of the -- how this might play out by quarter."

But we're not going to just lower our standards because we happen to be sitting on some cash right now. I think that's the best way I can characterize it.
MTS is a compelling ad. It has it has characteristics that are very similar to the Instron business that we bought back in 2005, entry margins are roughly the same. I think it were a couple of points higher, similar end market characteristics. It's a terrific fit. It wouldn't matter what time -- what year -- where we were in the cycle or what time of year it was, we have another MTS like opportunity, we will take full advantage, do our best to take full advantage. And that's the best way I can I think it."

As Scott said, if the right opportunity comes along, we're going to be certainly looking closely at things. So I wouldn't read anything into the buybacks coming back. We are in the fortunate position where when I talked about the 4 priorities from a capital allocation standpoint, for us, it's not A, B, C or D. It's really we can do all of the above.

The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. From my perspective, the highlights are that Q4 revenues got back to year ago levels despite Food Equipment being down 17%. And that operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 records for the company.
It was a pretty solid finish to a year that, needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021. While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built and honed over the past 8 years through the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did.
Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we were focused the entire company on only 2 core imperatives: A, to protect the health safety and well-being of our people; and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence. And in my view, we executed extremely well on both.
Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in the support of these 2 key pandemic priorities. Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring. And there's no question that we differentiated ourselves with many of our key customers. As a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts.
We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we thought through how we should manage the company through the pandemic. Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress tested the company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past 8 years have resulted in a very strong and very resilient company. And then as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down. That for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long term.
This conclusion led to 2 key decisions that we made regarding how we were going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis. First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last 8 years to reinforce our commitment to our people. First, by providing full compensation and benefit support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe, and by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprise-wide employment reduction mandates or programs at any point in 2020. These were not obvious or easy decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances, but we believe that they were the right decisions for our company. And I know that our people will remember them. These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3.
Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our win and recovery agenda and mindset across the company when the recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy. What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic.
When the recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic, as across the company, we had to read and react to the realities of the near-term situation as we always do. But it does mean that we are committed to protecting key investments supporting the execution of our long-term strategy and that we have, from very early on, given our divisional leadership teams the mandate to continue to think long term and to remain aggressive through the pandemic. For 2021, our Win the Recovery posture and mindset continues on and serves as the central thing driving the 2021 operating plans for every one of our 83 divisions.
Before I turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q4 performance and our 2021 guidance, let me close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional performance and dedication in the face of the most challenging and unprecedented circumstances of the past year. The performance that they delivered in 2020 provides another proof point that ITW is a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, resilience and agility necessary to deliver consistent top-tier performance in any environment.
Like many of you, I'm sure, we are hopeful for a return to somewhere in the vicinity of normal at some point in 2021. And with that, getting back to giving our full attention to taking ITW all the way for the company's full potential. Between now and whenever that is, we will continue to leverage the full breadth of ITW's capabilities and competitive advantages to keep our people safe, continue to serve our customers with excellence and execute our long-term enterprise strategy.
Michael, over to you."

Please turn to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see solid recovery of progress in many of the end markets that we serve, as evidenced by our revenue being up sequentially 5% versus the third quarter. The increase is 8% when you adjust for equal number of days when historically, our revenue per day has increased by 1% from Q3 to Q4.
Overall, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion; operating income of $883 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year; operating margin of 24.4%; free cash flow of $705 million and GAAP EPS of $2.02. After-tax return on invested capital improved to 32%. And as Scott mentioned, operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were fourth quarter records for the company.
Revenue in all major geographies improved sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, North America organic revenue declined 3%, international revenue grew 1%, Europe was down 2%. Similar to Q3, China was a bright spot with 11% growth.
As we've talked about before, the operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, also applies to a cost structure, which was on full display through our operating margin performance in Q4. We improved operating margin by 170 basis points to 25.4%, the second highest margin rate in a quarter in the history of the company. And like I said, grew operating income 7% to $883 million, the highest fourth quarter ever.
The biggest driver of our margin improvement remains our enterprise initiatives, as the ITW team executed on projects and activities that contributed 130 basis points in Q4. The impact was broad-based with all segments delivering enterprise initiative benefits in the range of 80 to 170 basis points.
GAAP EPS was $2.02, up 2%, but keep in mind that Q4 last year had $0.11 of onetime gains from divestitures. If you exclude those gains, EPS was up 7%, the same as operating income.
Working capital performance was excellent, and free cash flow of $705 million was solid with a conversion rate of 110% of net income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 22.1%, down slightly from last year.
In summary, a strong finish to a challenging year and very good momentum as we head into 2021.
Let's move to Slide 5 to review fourth quarter's recovery and response by segment. We updated this slide from our last earnings call with Q4 information. And you can see that our segments continue to respond effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenue and operating margin. I will just highlight a few things to illustrate the resilience and adaptability of our businesses.
You can see the rapid recovery in our end markets relative to the Q2 bottom of down 27%. In Q4, 3 of our segments experienced demand levels that were higher than a year ago. The most pronounced recovery has been in Automotive OEM, which has more than doubled since Q2 and grew 8% year-over-year in Q4 as did Construction Products.
Polymers & Fluids grew 7%, while demand in 3 segments, Test & Measurement and Electronics, Welding and Specialty Products was only slightly lower year-over-year. As you would expect, Food Equipment continues to be impacted by the effect of the pandemic, although we are seeing some sequential improvement. Overall, you can see the benefit of having a high-quality, diversified portfolio and the fact that we're back to demand levels of a year ago, with total revenue essentially flat year-over-year despite one of our core segments being down organically by 19%.
On the right side of the page, you can see the operating flexibility that I just talked about and how it also applies to our cost structure and ultimately shows up in our operating margin performance. At the bottom, in Q2, we still delivered solid operating margins of 17.5%, and only 2 segments were below 20%.
In Q4, we're almost 800 basis points higher at 25.4% despite no volume growth year-over-year, and every segment is back above 22%, including Food Equipment, as 6 out of 7 segments achieved record fourth quarter operating margins.
Let's move on to Slide 6 for a closer look at individual segment performance, starting with Automotive OEM. The team has continued to execute exceptionally well from a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to customer demand levels that have more than doubled since Q2. In Q4, organic growth of 8% year-over-year was the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2017. While North America was flat in Q2, it was more than offset by strong demand in Europe, which grew 10% and China, which grew 20%.
As expected, Food Equipment end markets remained challenged in Q4. Organic revenue was down 19%, a little better than the third quarter. And demand in Q4 was similar to Q3 when you look at it by geography and the end markets. North America was down 20%, international down 18%, equipment sales were down 20% and service was down 18%. Institutional demand was down about 30% with restaurants down a little bit more than that. And not surprisingly, the bright spot throughout the year continue to be retail with organic growth of 8%.
Moving to Slide 7 for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Q4 organic revenue declined 3%, with Test & Measurement down 8% against a tough comparison of plus 6% in Q4 '19. Electronics was up 3%. And while demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, the segment benefited from considerable strength in several end markets, including semiconductor, health care and clean room.
As you may have seen on January 19, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Amphenol to acquire MTS' Test & Simulation business. The Test & Simulation business is very complementary to our Instron business, which we highlighted during our 2018 Investor Day, and some of you may have visited our facility outside of Boston. MTS' Test & Simulation business has similar organic growth potential, and there's substantial opportunity for margin improvement through the application of the ITW business model.
Pre-COVID revenues in fiscal year 2019 were $559 million with operating margin of 6%. We expect to get the business to generate ITW caliber operating margins by the end of year 5, and generate after tax ROIC in the high teens by the end of year 10.
As you saw in the announcement, we expect the acquisition to close in the middle of 2021 and we're very much looking forward to welcoming the MTS' Test & Simulation team to the ITW family.
Moving on, please turn to Slide 8, in Welding, where we saw a meaningful pickup in demand as organic revenue improved from being down 10% year-over-year in Q3 to only being down 2% in Q4. Our commercial business, which primarily serves smaller businesses and individual users and accounts for 35% of the revenue in this segment remained strong and grew 12% year-over-year.
Our Industrial business showed signs of strong recovery from being down 23% in Q3 to down only 5% in Q4 as customer activity and equipment orders gained strength. Overall, organic revenue for equipment was flat versus prior year and much improved versus a 10% decline in the third quarter.
Polymers & Fluids delivered strong organic growth of 7%, with Fluids up 16% with continued strong demand in end markets related to health care and hygiene. The Automotive Aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales with organic growth of 5% and Polymers grew 4% with solid demand for MRO and automotive applications.
Moving to Slide 9. Construction continued to benefit from strong demand in the home center channel and delivered organic growth of 8% in Q4. Growth was strong across all geographies, with North America up 10% double-digit growth in the residential renovation market, offset by commercial construction, which represents only about 15% of North America revenue, down 11%. Europe grew 9% and Australia and New Zealand grew 5% due to strong retail sales.
Specialty Organic revenue was down 3% this quarter, with North America down 2% and international revenue down 4%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid but was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses.
So that concludes the segment commentary, and let's move on to the full year 2020 summary results on Slide 10. And in the face of unprecedented challenges that included temporary customer shutdowns across wide swaths of our end markets during the year, organic revenue was down 10%. Still, we delivered operating income of $2.9 billion, and highly resilient operating margin of 22.9%, only down 120 basis points year-over-year, despite no major cost takeout initiatives on mandates and with a strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives. After-tax ROIC was 26.2% and free cash flow was $2.6 billion.
Throughout the pandemic, one of our priorities was to maintain our financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality. And as you can see, we did just that in 2020. ITW's balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity. We did not have a need to issue any debt or commercial paper in 2020. And we ended the year with total debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 2.5x, which was only slightly above our 2.25x target. At year-end, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
With 2020 behind us, let's move to Slide 11 for a discussion of our guidance for 2021. So starting with the caveat that we continue to operate in a fairly uncertain economic environment, we have based our guidance, as we always do, on the current levels of demand in our businesses. Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level.
Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and adds 2 percentage points to revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%.
At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint. We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint.
Enterprise initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021 as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year.
We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment and embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals. Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income.
I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021. Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses. Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third priority are selective, high-quality acquisitions that supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential.
I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only. After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021.
In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders, and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021. We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%.
Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year. And instead, focus our time, and efforts on the recovery in 2021. While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given our expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022.
Let's turn to Slide 12 and the forecast for organic growth by segment. With the caveat again that the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment. And based on the current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021. At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%.
To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built over the past 8 years through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any environment.
Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year. And our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.
With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you."

And I think there remains ample room to continue on that path for a number of years. We also have some performance goals out there.
You're right. It's been a couple of years. But I think 2 years ago was when we updated those goals, and we remain absolutely on track and committed to delivering on those goals. And as we get closer to that, we'll figure out what the next step is -- steps are."

And we're, as we sit here today, the low end is Food Equipment at 22%, and the high end is Welding at 29%.  Very different range from when we started the strategy 8 years ago. And I think the fact that we have businesses delivering margins in the high 20s just gives us further confidence in the long-term goals that we've laid out for the company.
So the big driver in '21 remains Enterprise Initiatives. Those are broad-based in every segment. We'll make progress on 80/20 on Strategic Sourcing. And certainly, we expect also a meaningful contribution from volume leverage as we go through the year here. But I wouldn't single any segment out as having more margin improvement potential than others. I think we expect all of our segments to continue to make progress towards their full potential."

So just on the -- there's a lot of talk about the shortage of semiconductor in the Automotive OEM space. What I can tell you is, and this is true across all of our businesses, we've not seen a slowdown in demand and strong momentum going into the year certainly carried through January. It is possible though that we may see some production slowdown here in Q1 at some of our customers. Whether that will impact the demand -- their demand for our products, I think, remains to be seen. We view this right now as more of a timing issue. And so certainly, this could put a little bit of pressure on the Auto business here in the first quarter. But as we sit here today, we would have assumed that we're going to catch that up in Q2 or the second half of the year.
In terms of the quarterly cadence for the Auto business, I think you saw the strong performance here in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Like I said, we've not seen anything to suggest that demand is slowing down when we're looking at the January results. So we expect given how we've planned the business to be off to a pretty good start with positive organic growth and margin improvement in the first quarter, that typically -- sequentially that builds as we go through the year. Q2 will be, as Scott said, the biggest quarter and the second half, the comps start to get a little bit more challenging. The build numbers are a little bit different. But that's probably as much as I can give you on the Automotive business and kind of the -- how this might play out by quarter."

I don't know that there's anything else that I would say would really stand out.

The -- our interest in adding quality assets to ITW that fit our strategy and then meet the criteria that I talked about that was, in my response to another question, that doesn't go up and down. That is always there. We have plenty of capacity, whether we have cash on hand or whether we have -- we need to use the balance sheet. That's just a timing issue. We generate so much cash. We have the ability to improve these assets we buy, we generate great returns. It's just a matter of the -- we're also very disciplined. So we find -- we come across an opportunity that we think fits. It's not a situational. What -- is it the right time or not. It's -- we have ample capacity to do it. But we're not going to just lower our standards because we happen to be sitting on some cash right now. I think that's the best way I can characterize it.
MTS is a compelling add. It has characteristics that are very similar to the Instron business that we bought back in 2005, entry margins are roughly the same. I think it were a couple of points higher, similar end market characteristics. It's a terrific fit. It wouldn't matter what time -- what year -- where we were in the cycle or what time of year it was, we have another MTS like opportunity, we will take full advantage, do our best to take full advantage of it. And that's the best way I can I think say it."

So I wouldn't read anything into the buybacks coming back.

Good morning, everyone. In Q1, we saw continued improvement in both the breadth and pace of the recovery, with 6 of our 7 segments delivering strong growth in the quarter, with revenue increases at the segment level ranging from 6% to 13%, and that's with 1 less shipping day in Q1 of this year versus last year. 
At the enterprise level, organic growth was plus 6% in Q1 or plus 8% on an equal days basis, and that was despite the fact that our Food Equipment segment was still down 10% in the quarter. 
The fundamental strength of our 80/20 front-to-back business system and the skill and dedication of our people around the world, combined with the Win the Recovery actions that we initiated over the course of the past year allowed us to meet our customers' increasing needs while at the same time delivering strong profitability leverage, as evidenced by our 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental margins and 120 basis points of margin benefits from our enterprise initiatives in the quarter. 
Despite rising raw material costs and a tight supply chain environment, we maintained our world-class service levels to our customers while also establishing several all-time Q1 performance records for the company, including earnings per share of $2.11, operating income of $905 million at an operating margin of 25.5%. 
Based on our first quarter results and our normal practice of projecting current demand rates through the balance of the year, we are adjusting our 2021 guidance. For the full year, we now expect organic growth of 10% to 12%, operating margin in the range of 25% to 26% and EPS of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, which at the $8.40 midpoint represents 27% earnings growth versus last year. 
At the midpoint of our revised guidance, 2021 full year revenues would be up 1% versus 2019 and EPS would be up 9%. 
Now stating the obvious, there's still a lot of ground to cover between now and the end of the year, and the near-term environment is certainly not without its challenges. That being said, I have no doubt that we are well positioned to respond to whatever comes our way as we move through the remainder of the year and to continue to deliver differentiated performance in 2021 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael?"
280561,710697559,2265026,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world resp",2291,"All right. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. 
The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world responded to our customers' increasing needs, as they always do, and delivered revenue growth of 10%. 
Organic growth of 6% was the highest organic growth rate for ITW in almost 10 years. And as Scott mentioned, Q1 had 1 less day this year. And on an equal days basis, organic revenue grew 8%. Organic growth was positive across all major geographies, with China leading the way with 62%, North America was up 4% and Europe grew 1%. 
Relative to Q4, the new trend that emerged in Q1 was a meaningful pickup in demand in our CapEx-driven equipment businesses, Test & Measurement and Electronics, which grew 11%; and Welding, which grew 6%. 
GAAP EPS of $2.11 was up 19% and an all-time EPS record for continuing operations. 
Operating leverage was a real highlight this quarter with incremental margins of 45% as operating income grew 19% year-over-year. 
Operating margins improved to 25.5% in the quarter, an increase of almost 200 basis points as a result of volume leverage and a continued strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives, partially offset by the margin impact of price cost. Excluding the third quarter of 2017, which had the benefit of a onetime legal settlement, operating margin of 25.5% was our highest quarterly margin performance ever. 
As you know, supply chains around the world are under significant pressure, and ITW's operating teams certainly had to deal with their fair share of supply challenges and disruptions in the quarter. By leveraging our produce where we sell supply chain strategy, our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back business system and supported by the fact that we were fully staffed for this uptick in demand due to our window recovery initiative, we were able to maintain our normal service levels to our customers. And once again, our ability to deal with the impact of some pretty meaningful supply chain challenges and disruptions and still take care of our customers, with strong levels of profitability, speaks to the quality of the execution at ITW. 
In the quarter, we experienced raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And across the company, our operating teams have already initiated pricing plans and actions that will offset all incurred as well as known but not yet incurred raw material cost increases on a dollar per dollar basis, as per our usual process. As a result, price cost is expected to be EPS-neutral for the year. 
As you know, given our high-margin profile, offsetting cost increases with price on a dollar per dollar basis causes some modest dilution of our operating margin percentage and our incremental margin percentage in the near term. In Q1, for example, our operating margin was impacted 60 basis points due to price costs. And our incremental margin would actually have been 52%, not 45%, if it wasn't for this impact from price costs. 
For the balance of the year and embedded in our guidance are all known raw material increases and the corresponding pricing actions that have either already been implemented or will be. Again, EPS-neutral for the full year. 
At this early stage in the recovery, our 25.5% operating margins are already exceeding our pre-COVID operating margins. 4 of the 7 segments delivered operating margin of around 28% or better in Q1, with 1 segment, Welding, above 30% in a quarter for the first time ever. I think it says a lot of our operating teams, that when faced with the challenges of the global pandemic, they stayed focused on our long-term enterprise strategy and continue to make progress towards our long-term margin performance goal of 28% plus. 
After-tax return on capital was a record 32.1%. And free cash flow was solid at $541 million with a conversion of 81% of net income, in line with typical seasonality for Q1. We continue to expect 100% plus conversion for the full year. 
As planned, we repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter, and the effective tax rate was 22.4%, slightly below prior year. 
So in summary, the first quarter was solid for ITW with broad-based organic growth of 6%, strong profitability leverage, 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental profitability and record operating margin and EPS performance. 
So please turn to Slide 4 for the segment performance. And the information on the left side of the page summarizes the organic revenue growth rate versus prior year by segment for Q1 this year compared to Q4 last year. And it illustrates the broad-based demand recovery that we're seeing in our businesses. And obviously, there's a positive impact as the easier comparisons begin on a year-over-year basis. 
With the exception of Automotive OEM, every segment had a higher organic growth rate in Q1 than they did in Q4, and 6 of our 7 segments delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, with double-digit growth in Construction Products, and Test & Measurement and Electronics, which were also the most improved segments in this sequential view, going down -- going from down 3% in Q4 to up 11% in Q1. Welding improved 8 percentage points, growing 6% in Q1, providing further evidence that the industrial CapEx recovery is beginning to take hold as visibility and confidence is coming back. 
At the enterprise level, ITW's organic growth rate went from down 1% in Q4 to up 6%. And I would just highlight that this is 6% organic growth with one of our segments, Food Equipment, while on its way to recovery is still down 10% year-over-year. 
As we go through the segment slides, you'll see that this robust organic growth, combined with strong enterprise initiative impact, contributed to some pretty strong operating margin performance in our segments. 
So let's go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with our Automotive OEM. And the demand recovery in the fourth quarter continued this quarter with organic growth of 8% and total revenue growth of 13%. North America revenue was down 2% as customers continue to adjust their production schedules in response to the well-publicized shortage of certain components, including semiconductor chips. We estimate this impacted our Q1 sales by about $25 million, and it is likely to continue to impact our revenues to the tune of about $50 million in Q2 and and another $50 million in the second half of the year. As you can appreciate, the situation is obviously pretty fluid, but as we sit here today, that is our best estimate, and that is also what we embedded in our updated guidance. 
Looking past the near-term supply chain issues affecting the auto industry, we're pretty optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects as consumer demand remains strong and dealer inventories are very low by historical standards. 
By region, North America being down in Q1 was more than offset by Europe, which was up 4%, and China up 58%. And finally, the team delivered solid operating margin performance of 24.1%, an improvement of 320 basis points. 
Please turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment. So revenue was down 7%, with organic revenue down 10%, but like I said, much improved versus Q4. And there are solid signs that demand is beginning to recover, as evidenced by orders picking up and a backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. 
Overall, North America was down 6%, with equipment down only 1% as compared to a 22% decline in Q4. Institutional, which represents about 35% of our North American equipment business was down 7%, with healthcare about flat and education is still down about 10%. Restaurants, which represents 25% of our equipment business, was down in the mid-teens, with full-service restaurants down about 30%, but fast casual up low single digits. Retail, which is now 25% of the business, was up more than 20% as a result of strong demand and new product rollouts. 
International was down 15% and is really a tale of 2 regions. As you would expect, Europe was down 22% due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific was up 44%, with China up 99%. 
Overall equipment sales were down 4% and service down 19%. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered revenue growth of 14% with 11% organic growth. Test & Measurement was up 7% with continued strength in semiconductors and healthcare end markets now supplemented by strengthening demand in the capital equipment businesses as evidenced by the Instron business growing 12%. 
The electronics business grew 16%, with strong demand for [ team room ] technology products, automotive applications and consumer electronics. 
Operating margin of 28.4% was up 330 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong sequential improvement in Welding as the segment delivered organic growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in almost 3 years. The commercial business, which serves smaller businesses and individual users, usually leads the way in a recovery, and Q1 was their third quarter in a row with double-digit growth, up 17% this quarter. The industrial business continued its sequential improvement trend and was down only 1% with customer CapEx spend picking up and backlogs building. Overall, equipment sales were up 10% and consumables were flat versus prior year. 
North America was up 7%. And international growth of 4% was primarily driven by recovery in China and some early signs of demand picking up in oil and gas. 
Solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives contributed to a record margin performance of 30.3%, which, as I said, marked the first time an ITW segment delivered operating margins above 30%. 
Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 9%, with polymers up 16%, driven by strength in MRO applications particularly for heavy industries. 
The automotive aftermarket business continued to benefit from strong retail sales with organic growth of 9%. While fluids, which has a larger presence in Europe was down 1%. 
Operating margin benefited from solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives to deliver margins of 25.7%. 
Moving to Slide 7. Construction was the fastest-growing segment this quarter with organic growth of 13%. North America was up 12%, with continued strong demand in residential renovation and in the home center channel. Commercial construction, which is only about 15% of our U.S. sales, was up 3%. European sales grew 19% with double-digit growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand grew 7%, with strength in both residential and commercial markets. 
Operating margin of 27.6% was an improvement of 420 basis points. 
Specialty revenues were up 10% with organic revenue of 7% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 6%; Europe, up 5%; and Asia Pacific was up 24%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid at 6%. 
So please turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. And per our usual process, and with the caveat that we're only 1 quarter into the new year and a significant number of uncertainties and challenges are still in front of us, we are raising our guidance on all key performance metrics, including organic growth, operating margin and EPS. 
In doing so, we've obviously factored in our solid Q1 results. And per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand exit in Q1, into the future and addressing them for typical seasonality. And as discussed, we've made an allowance for the estimated impact of semiconductor chip shortages on our Auto OEM customers. 
The outcome of that exercise is an organic growth forecast of 10% to 12% at the enterprise level. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 7% to 10%. 
Foreign currency at today's exchange rates adds 2 percentage points to revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 12% to 14%. 
As you saw, we're off to a strong start on operating leverage and enterprise initiatives, and we are raising our operating margin guidance by 100 basis points to a new range of 25% to 26%, which incorporates all known raw material cost increases and the corresponding pricing actions. 
Relative to 2020, our 2021 operating margins of 25% to 26% are 250 basis points higher at the midpoint and they are almost 150 basis points higher than our pre-COVID 2019 operating margins of 24.1% as we continue to make progress towards our long-term performance goal of 28% plus, as I mentioned earlier. 
Our incremental margins for the full year are expected to be above our typical 35% to 40% range. 
Finally, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.60 and or 8% to a new range of $8.20 to $8.60. The new midpoint of $8.40 represents an earnings growth rate of 27% versus prior year and a 9% increase relative to pre-COVID  2019 EPS of $7.74. 
A few final housekeeping items to wrap it up, with no changes to: one, the forecast for free cash flow; two, our plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our own shares; and three, our expected tax rate of 23% to 24%. 
As per usual process, our guidance is for the core business only and excludes the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business. The process to close the acquisition by midyear remains on track. And once the acquisition closes, we'll provide an update. As we've said before, we do not expect a material financial impact to earnings in 2021. 
So in summary, a quarter of quality execution in a challenging environment, and as a result, we're off to a solid start to the year. So with that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you."

Obviously, the organic growth that you saw in the quarter was fairly strong. I'm just trying to understand how much of it is sort of just end markets recovering versus sort of structural market share gains that ITW has been able to achieve? I guess that's my first question. If you can help us on that. 
And then my second question, the incrementals that you're putting up, the 45%, and then 52% if we adjust for price cost. This is above your targeted range with supply chain -- sorry, with [ COVID costs ] and inefficiencies and things like that, I'm just wondering if we should rethink, at some point, your targeted incrementals?"

So I think on the first one, it's a little too early to tell. I mean I think we certainly feel very good about how we are positioned with our Win the Recovery strategy and the fact that we stayed invested, giving us the ability to capture market share as we've talked about. So I think it's a little too early to tell how much of that growth in Q1 is really market versus market share gains. 
And I'll just add to that, we've also seen an uptick from the contribution of our customer-back innovation efforts. And so again, that's a result of being able to stay invested in those. 
And then I'd point to our supply chain and our ability to maintain our service levels, where maybe others are struggling a little bit more. So I think anecdotally, there are certainly lots of evidence, if you were to ask our divisions, and our segments that we're picking up share. And again, we're going after sustainable, high-quality, profitable market share gains, not opportunistic. And so we feel really good about the start to the year on account of those things. 
I think on the incrementals, I agree with you, that was a real bright spot, significantly above our normal range of 35% to 40%. At these early stages in the recovery, we expect to be able to maintain the incrementals above the typical range. So 40% plus is what we're planning for and also embedded in our guidance, as you saw today. If you do the math, that's where you end up. 
I think it's a little premature to update kind of the long-term incremental margin expectations. I think we're comfortable with kind of long term in the 35% to 40% range. We're certainly making a lot of improvement to the cost structure of the company. But let's revisit that at a later stage in terms of what we think the long-term incrementals might be on a go-forward basis. For now, if you think kind of beyond this year, I would still stick to the kind of the 35% to 40%."

All of it's basically standard, new team. But that's I think a great example of where I think acquisitions supplement our core growth focus, which is really owning great businesses that deliver great value to their customers and that we can grow organically. And MTS certainly adds and supplements our capabilities in terms of the Test & Measurement space and our ability to do so. 
I'm not going to comment on your specific reference or any other deals that others have announced recently, but I would say that we -- our appetite for additional MTS-light deals remains certainly strong. I think you're -- I can't remember exactly the term used, Jeff, but I think the phrase opportunistic is the right way to think about it. It's a combination of, ultimately, what we're interested in doing, what fits with the availability of assets that fit that profile. And that includes both their strategic attributes, the attributes that they offer in terms of our ability to improve their inherent financial performance and all at a value that we think makes sense for us and our shareholders and in terms of return on not just the capital, but the time, effort and energy that we're going to expend. 
So that's sort of the generic strategic narrative around it. My personal view is I absolutely think, on average, 1 to 3 MTS kinds of deals a year seems to be a reasonable -- something that absolutely is achievable. We're not going to try to sort of force a deal every year on that. So some years are going to be 0 because the circumstances are not going to present -- the circumstances that we're looking for are not going to present themselves. But I think there's lots of room for other similar kinds of deals to be additive to what we're doing in a relatively consistent way over, let's say, the 5-year period. I think I'll stop there."

And I would also say that it's absolutely fair that we are having to work a lot harder in terms of securing our own sources of supply than we would under normal circumstances. So we have, for a number of reasons, I think, been able to counter punch our way through a much more challenging supply environment in the first quarter and through the second quarter, I think we're going to be able to do the same, broadly speaking, partly because we source local, that's -- we know our suppliers. We source where we produce. And I think partly because of our -- the fact that we stayed invested. We hang on to our people, so we're not having to add people back to support this -- this uptick in demand. But it's -- I don't want to -- no one should take from that, that it's been smooth and easy the whole way through. So we're in the [ tube ] with everybody else and certainly having to work harder than normal to sustain our ability to supply. But I think so far, I feel like we've been able to, as I said, counter punch our way through it pretty well. 
And I would also say beyond the automotive space, there are certainly some pockets where we have some other -- some of our customers being impacted by some of their own supply chain issues.

So that's the one where, in the near term, we're seeing the most significant pressure on margins from a price cost standpoint. 
And the other 6 segments, I think there's, given the differentiated nature of our -- the products and services that we provide, we have a long history of being able to offset any cost increases with price. There's typically a little bit of a lag. I will tell you, we learned some things when we went through this in 2018. We are -- we're definitely much more, say, focused and on top of things earlier on. And our divisions are taking the actions that are required to kind of stay ahead of things this time around. 
So while there's certainly some pressure here, you saw 60 basis points of margin percentage impact and 7 percentage points of incremental margin impact. The overall goal here is to offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and we're confident that we'll be able to do that for the year and in total, even with the pressure and the difficulty in automotive."

I'd point to MTS as being -- it's not quite $0.5 billion in annual revenue. So it's not a small business by any stretch. 
I'd tell you a couple of things. One is that we have never been more prepared from the standpoint of discipline around integration, our -- the quality of practice around our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, the depth of talent. This is all a result of the last 9 years of work on this. So all of that certainly is just additive to, I think, our ability to -- if we find the right opportunity to do a really good job with it. So it's not an issue of -- size doesn't scare us. I think sometimes what does happen is the larger the size, there tends to be it's a time to sort of a pure play. This is the part of the business. We want it all. The bigger the asset, the more sort of nonstrategic, nondesirable stuff you have to deal with sometimes. But that's also just sort of part of the tactics.

I'm trying to think about how to sort of tackle that one, John. It's -- maybe the place to start is, inherent in our system is -- we always talk about the fact that we produce today what our customers bought yesterday. So inherent in that -- what makes that work is the fact that we are always carrying surplus capacity, so -- on the order of magnitude of 15% to 20% over what current demand is. Because that demand comes in -- it's an average on a daily basis. So the only way we can produce today what our customers bought yesterday, as that number moves up and down, is to make sure that we have ample extra capacity to flex. So that sort of helps us as things accelerate, we do have a cushion to lean on. We also have -- our supplier base is connected into that system in a way that they're also carrying that kind of ability to flex. Now it works really well. It doesn't work perfectly, certainly with -- we have our sort of rubs and issues along the way, and I'm sure we will. But there are things that we can overcome and work our way through.

And so those are businesses that are more driven by investment in CapEx. And I think as the visibility to the recovery and the confidence in the recovery takes hold, our customers are placing orders for larger equipment. And we saw a little bit of that also in Specialty Products, on the packaging equipment side. And it's really a broad-based trend. So I don't really have the breakdown for you on a global basis, but really across the board, we saw really nice pickup in demand for the CapEx-driven products and those 3 businesses in particular.

My personal view, Ann, is that's maybe not even such a bad thing in terms of extending the duration of the recovery and sort of managing the pace a little bit in the short run. So even with these auto, auto is a real extreme example of that, not so much on labor, but from semiconductor chips. Michael talked about the fact that consumer demand for autos is strong. Dealer inventories are at, I think, around the world, historic lows. So the fact that all of that is not trying to be satisfied in 2 quarters and it actually gets spread out, and so I just use that same analogy in places like Food Equipment, as I don't think it's necessarily a terrible thing that there are some limitations, either labor or other things, as we move through the recovery in some of our sectors. It doesn't mean demand isn't going to grow. It's just -- it's not going to be this feeding frenzy of satisfying in a relatively short period of time. I don't know exactly how it's all going to play out, but I don't think some of those limitations in the near term are necessarily bad things for the long haul, if that makes sense."

I think on price cost, I mean, what we're talking about right now is this pretty significant increase in raw material costs and offsetting those dollar-for-dollar with price. And in the near term, as I said, that puts pressure on margins. I think once you get past the surge in raw material costs and those start to kind of stabilize or maybe even come down a little bit as expected, frankly, for some of these commodities in the back half of the year, you're holding on to the price and you're going to end up in a favorable position again from a price cost standpoint. That's kind of how this has played out historically. 
And historically, that's what's been embedded in that 35% to 40% incremental margin rate that we've been able to put up. I think once we go through -- there is kind of the planning for 2022, I'll give you a better feel for the ability to maintain incremental margins either above the historical range or in the historical range. But as we sit here today, like I said earlier, I would -- for modeling purposes, I would stick to the 35% to 40% for now. And we'll give you an update as we go through the year here. But clearly, this year and in Q1 and in the near term, really strong incremental margin performance. I don't know if I said this, but we're above the range of 35% to 40%, so 40% plus, and that's with price/cost for the full year.

I mean, we're clearly -- as the top line grows 10%, you're going to see, at least in the near term, a corresponding increase in inventory levels, which is part of what Scott talked about as demand grows, inventory levels are going to grow. The same thing with receivables. The fact that receivables are growing is actually -- as you know, it's a good thing. I think what we keep an eye on is the working capital metrics around inventory months on hand are all trending in the right direction. 
I'll just point out that if you look at our -- you can see you're looking at from the outside, but when we look at our our receivable aging and our bad debt, we are below pre-COVID levels in a meaningful way. So I think the teams really did an excellent job managing working capital overall, including receivables last year. 
And I think we talked about in the last call, working capital headwinds, somewhere around $125 million was in the plan for this year. The growth is a little bit stronger, so it might be a little bit more than that, but it's not going to change. We still are confident we'll get to 100% plus conversion rate. But the goal here really is -- we generate plenty of cash. The goal here is to grow the company. It would make no sense for us to try to hold back on inventory levels at this point. 
So on CapEx, as you know, last year, some of the capacity expansions were deferred. A lot of those are coming back now. CapEx will be somewhere around 2% of sales, which is where it has been historically. That is not a set number. That's an outcome of how we allocate capital. So if you pencil in somewhere around  $300 million, that's directionally, that's probably where we'll end up. That's up. I think last year, we did $236 million or something like that. So we're definitely expanding. And you saw the CapEx number moved up a little bit here in the first quarter. And that's really as these capacity expansions are -- we're adding equipment, we're adding injection molding machines in auto and other places to support our customers as demand recovers."

And then in auto, just with the -- some of these supply chain issues and the allowance we made in our guidance, they're probably towards the low end of the range that we gave back in January. I think the range back then was 14 to 18. And we're probably at the low end of that. 
Auto builds are still projected to be up 12% for the year. So we'll see. That's the one area where there's quite a bit of uncertainty particularly. And I'll just maybe reiterate this, be a little cautious around the second quarter here and not get too excited.

Good morning, everyone. In Q1, we saw continued improvement in both the breadth and pace of the recovery with 6 of our 7 segments delivering strong growth in the quarter with revenue increases at the segment level, ranging from 6% to 13%, and that's with 1 less shipping day in Q1 of this year versus last year. At the enterprise level, organic growth was plus 6% in Q1 or plus 8% on an equal days' basis, and that was despite the fact that our Food Equipment segment was still down 10% in the quarter.
The fundamental strength of our 80/20 front-to-back business system and the skill and dedication of our people around the world, combined with the Win the Recovery actions that we initiated over the course of the past year, allowed us to meet our customers' increasing needs while at the same time delivering strong profitability leverage, as evidenced by our 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental margins and 120 basis points of margin benefits from our enterprise initiatives in the quarter. 
Despite rising raw material costs and a tight supply chain environment, we maintained our world-class service levels to our customers while also establishing several all-time Q1 performance records for the company, including earnings per share of $2.11, operating income of $905 million and an operating margin of 25.5%.
Based on our first quarter results and our normal practice of projecting current demand rates through the balance of the year, we are adjusting our 2021 guidance. For the full year, we now expect organic growth of 10% to 12%, operating margin in the range of 25% to 26% and EPS of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, which at the $8.40 midpoint represents 27% earnings growth versus last year. At the midpoint of our revised guidance, 2021 full year revenues would be up 1% versus 2019, and EPS would be up 9%. 
Now stating the obvious, there's still a lot of ground to cover between now and the end of the year, and the near-term environment is certainly not without its challenges. That being said, I have no doubt that we are well positioned to respond to whatever comes our way as we move through the remainder of the year and to continue to deliver differentiated performance in 2021 and beyond.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael?"
280561,710697559,2265605,"Illinois Tool Works Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Illinois Tool Works Inc.","Executives","All right. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world respon",2282,"All right. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world responded to our customers' increasing needs, as they always do, and delivered revenue growth of 10%. Organic growth of 6% was the highest organic growth rate for ITW in almost 10 years. And as Scott mentioned, Q1 had 1 less day this year. And on an equal days' basis, organic revenue grew 8%. Organic growth was positive across all major geographies with China leading the way with 62%, North America was up 4% and Europe grew 1%.
Relative to Q4, the new trend that emerged in Q1 was a meaningful pickup in demand in our CapEx-driven equipment businesses: Test & Measurement and Electronics, which grew 11%; and Welding, which grew 6%.
GAAP EPS of $2.11 was up 19% and an all-time EPS record for continuing operations.
Operating leverage was a real highlight this quarter with incremental margins of 45% as operating income grew 19% year-over-year.
Operating margins improved to 25.5% in the quarter, an increase of almost 200 basis points as a result of volume leverage and a continued strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives, partially offset by the margin impact of price/cost. Excluding the third quarter of 2017, which had the benefit of a onetime legal settlement, operating margin of 25.5% was our highest quarterly margin performance ever.
As you know, supply chains around the world are under significant pressure, and ITW's operating teams certainly had to deal with their fair share of supply challenges and disruptions in the quarter. By leveraging our produce where we sell supply chain strategy, our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back business system and supported by the fact that we were fully staffed for this uptick in demand due to our Win the Recovery initiative, we were able to maintain our normal service levels to our customers. And once again, our ability to deal with the impact of some pretty meaningful supply chain challenges and disruptions and still take care of our customers with strong levels of profitability speaks to the quality of the execution at ITW.
In the quarter, we experienced raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And across the company, our operating teams have already initiated pricing plans and actions that will offset all incurred, as well as known but not yet incurred, raw material cost increases on a dollar per dollar basis, as per our usual process. As a result, price/cost is expected to be EPS-neutral for the year.
As you know, given our high-margin profile, offsetting cost increases with price on a dollar per dollar basis causes some modest dilution of our operating margin percentage and our incremental margin percentage in the near term. In Q1, for example, our operating margin was impacted 60 basis points due to price/costs. And our incremental margin would actually have been 52%, not 45%, if it wasn't for this impact from price/costs. For the balance of the year and embedded in our guidance are all known raw material increases and the corresponding pricing actions that have either already been implemented or will be, again EPS-neutral for the full year. 
At this early stage in the recovery, our 25.5% operating margins are already exceeding our pre-COVID operating margins. 4 of 7 segments delivered operating margin of around 28% or better in Q1 with 1 segment, Welding, above 30% in a quarter for the first time ever. I think it says a lot of our operating teams that when faced with the challenges of a global pandemic, they stayed focused on our long-term enterprise strategy and continued to make progress towards our long-term margin performance goal of 28% plus.
After-tax return on capital was a record 32.1%, and free cash flow was solid at $541 million with a conversion of 81% of net income, in line with typical seasonality for Q1. We continue to expect 100% plus conversion for the full year.
As planned, we repurchased $250 million of our shares this quarter. And the effective tax rate was 22.4%, slightly below prior year. 
So in summary, the first quarter was solid for ITW with broad-based organic growth of 6%, strong profitability leverage, 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental profitability and record operating margin and EPS performance.
So please turn to Slide 4 for the segment performance. And the information on the left side of the page summarizes the organic revenue growth rate versus prior year by segment for Q1 this year compared to Q4 last year, and it illustrates the broad-based demand recovery that we're seeing in our businesses. And obviously, there's a positive impact as the easier comparisons begin on a year-over-year basis.
With the exception of Automotive OEM, every segment had a higher organic growth rate in Q1 than they did in Q4, and 6 of our 7 segments delivered strong organic growth in the quarter with double-digit growth in Construction Products and Test & Measurement and Electronics, which were also the most improved segments in this sequential view, going down -- going from down 3% in Q4 to up 11% in Q1. Welding improved 8 percentage points, growing 6% in Q1, providing further evidence that the industrial CapEx recovery is beginning to take hold as visibility and confidence is coming back.
At the enterprise level, ITW's organic growth rate went from down 1% in Q4 to up 6%. And I would just highlight that this 6% organic growth with one of our segments, Food Equipment, while on its way to recovery, is still down 10% year-over-year.
As we go through the segment slides, you'll see that this robust organic growth, combined with strong enterprise initiative impact, contributed to some pretty strong operating margin performance in our segments.
So let's go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with Automotive OEM. And the demand recovery in the fourth quarter continued this quarter with organic growth of 8% and total revenue growth of 13%. North America revenue was down 2% as customers continued to adjust their production schedules in response to the well-publicized shortage of certain components, including semiconductor chips. We estimate this impacted our Q1 sales by about $25 million, and it is likely to continue to impact our revenues to the tune of about $50 million in Q2 and another $50 million in the second half of the year. As you can appreciate, the situation is obviously pretty fluid. 
But as we sit here today, that is our best estimate, and that is also what we embedded in our updated guidance. Looking past the near-term supply chain issues affecting the auto industry, we're pretty optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects as consumer demand remains strong and dealer inventories are very low by historical standards. By region, North America being down in Q1 was more than offset by Europe, which was up 4%; and China, up 58%. And finally, the team delivered solid operating margin performance of 24.1%, an improvement of 320 basis points.
Please turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment. So revenue was down 7% with organic revenue down 10%, but like I said, much improved versus Q4. And there are solid signs that demand is beginning to recover, as evidenced by orders picking up and a backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. Overall, North America was down 6%, with equipment down only 1% as compared to a 22% decline in Q4. Institutional, which represents about 35% of our North American equipment business, was down 7% with health care about flat and education still down about 10%. Restaurants, which represents 25% of our equipment business, was down in the mid-teens with full-service restaurants down about 30% but fast casual up low single digits. Retail, which is now 25% of the business, was up more than 20% as a result of strong demand and new product rollouts. International was down 15% and is really a tale of 2 regions. As you would expect, Europe was down 22% due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific was up 44% with China up 99%. Overall equipment sales were down 4% and service down 19%. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered revenue growth of 14% with 11% organic growth. Test & Measurement was up 7% with continued strength in semiconductors and health care end markets now supplemented by strengthening demand in the capital equipment businesses as evidenced by the Instron business growing 12%. The electronics business grew 16%, with strong demand for clean room technology products, automotive applications and consumer electronics. Operating margin of 28.4% was up 330 basis points.
Moving to Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we saw strong sequential improvement in Welding as the segment delivered organic growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in almost 3 years. The commercial business, which serves smaller businesses and individual users, usually leads the way in a recovery, and Q1 was their third quarter in a row with double-digit growth, up 17% this quarter. The industrial business continued its sequential improvement trend and was down only 1% with customer CapEx spend picking up and backlogs building. Overall, equipment sales were up 10%, and consumables were flat versus prior year. North America was up 7%, and international growth of 4% was primarily driven by recovery in China and some early signs of demand picking up in oil and gas, solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives contributed to a record margin performance of 30.3%, which, as I said, marked the first time an ITW segment delivered operating margins above 30%.
Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 9% with polymers up 16%, driven by strength in MRO applications, particularly for heavy industries. 
The automotive aftermarket business continued to benefit from strong retail sales with organic growth of 9%. While fluids, which has a larger presence in Europe, was down 1%. Operating margin benefited from solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives to deliver margins of 25.7%. 
Moving to Slide 7. Construction was the fastest-growing segment this quarter with organic growth of 13%. North America was up 12% with continued strong demand in residential renovation and in the home center channel. Commercial construction, which is only about 15% of our U.S. sales, was up 3%. European sales grew 19% with double-digit growth in U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand grew 7% with strength in both residential and commercial markets. Operating margin of 27.6% was an improvement of 420 basis points.
Specialty revenues were up 10% with organic revenue of 7% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 6%; Europe, up 5%; and Asia Pacific was up 24%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid at 6%. 
So please turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. And per our usual process and with the caveat that we're only 1 quarter into the new year and a significant number of uncertainties and challenges are still in front of us, we are raising our guidance on all key performance metrics, including organic growth, operating margin and EPS. In doing so, we've obviously factored in our solid Q1 results. And per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand exit in Q1 into the future and addressing them for typical seasonality. And as discussed, we've made an allowance for the estimated impact of semiconductor chip shortages on our auto OEM customers. The outcome of that exercise is an organic growth forecast of 10% to 12% at the enterprise level. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 7% to 10%. Foreign currency at today's exchange rates adds 2 percentage points to revenue for a total revenue growth forecast of 12% to 14%.
As you saw, we're off to a strong start on operating leverage and enterprise initiatives, and we are raising our operating margin guidance by 100 basis points to a new range of 25% to 26%, which incorporates all known raw material cost increases and the corresponding pricing actions.
Relative to 2020, our 2021 operating margins of 25% to 26% are 250 basis points higher at the midpoint, and they are almost 150 basis points higher than our pre-COVID 2019 operating margins of 24.1% as we continue to make progress towards our long-term performance goal of 28% plus, as I mentioned earlier. Our incremental margins for the full year are expected to be above our typical 35% to 40% range.
Finally, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.60 or 8% to a new range of $8.20 to $8.60. The new midpoint of $8.40 represents an earnings growth rate of 27% versus prior year and a 9% increase relative to pre-COVID 2019 EPS of $7.74.
A few final housekeeping items to wrap it up with no changes to, one, the forecast for free cash flow; two, our plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our own shares; and three, our expected tax rate of 23% to 24%. As per usual process, our guidance is for the core business only and excludes the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business. The process to close the acquisition by midyear remains on track. And once the acquisition closes, we'll provide an update. And as we've said before, we do not expect a material financial impact to earnings in 2021.
So in summary, a quarter of quality execution in a challenging environment, and as a result, we're off to a solid start to the year.
So with that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you."

Obviously, the organic growth that you saw in the quarter was fairly strong. I'm just trying to understand how much of it is sort of just end markets recovering versus sort of structural market share gains that ITW has been able to achieve. I guess that's my first question, if you can help us on that. 
And then my second question, the incrementals that you're putting up, the 45% and then 52%, if we adjust for price/cost. This is above your targeted range with supply chain -- sorry, with COVID just causing inefficiencies and things like that. I'm just wondering if we should rethink, at some point, your targeted incrementals."

So I think on the first one, it's a little too early to tell. I mean I think we certainly feel very good about how we are positioned with our Win the Recovery strategy and the fact that we stayed invested, giving us the ability to capture market share, as we've talked about. So I think it's a little too early to tell how much of that growth in Q1 is really market versus market share gains. And I'll just add to that, we've also seen an uptick from the contribution of our customer-back innovation efforts. And so again, that's a result of being able to stay invested in those. 
And then I'd point to our supply chain and our ability to maintain our service levels, where maybe others are struggling a little bit more. So I think anecdotally, there are certainly lots of evidence, if you were to ask our divisions and our segments that we're picking up share. And again, we're going after sustainable, high-quality, profitable market share gains, not opportunistic. And so we feel really good about the start to the year on account of those things. 
I think on the incrementals, I agree with you. That was a real bright spot, significantly above our normal range of 35% to 40%. At these early stages in the recovery, we expect to be able to maintain the incrementals above the typical range. So 40% plus is what we're planning for and also embedded in our guidance, as you saw today. If you do the math, that's where you end up. 
I think it's a little premature to update kind of the long-term incremental margin expectations. I think we're comfortable with kind of long term in the 35% to 40% range. We're certainly making a lot of improvement to the cost structure of the company, but let's revisit that at a later stage in terms of what we think the long-term incrementals might be on a go-forward basis. For now, if you think kind of beyond this year, I would still stick to the kind of the 35% to 40%."

All of it's basically standard, new team. But that's, I think, a great example of where I think acquisitions supplement our core growth focus, which is really owning great businesses that deliver great value to their customers and that we can grow organically. And MTS certainly adds and supplements our capabilities in terms of the test and measurement space and our ability to do so. 
I'm not going to comment on your specific reference or any other deals that others have announced recently, but I would say that we -- our appetite for additional MTS-light deals remains certainly strong. I think you're -- I can't remember exactly the term I used, Jeff, but I think the phrase opportunistic is the right way to think about it. It's a combination of, ultimately, what we're interested in doing, what fits with the availability of assets that fit that profile. And that includes both their strategic attributes, the attributes that they offer in terms of our ability to improve their inherent financial performance and all at a value that we think makes sense for us and our shareholders and in terms of return on not just the capital, but the time, effort and energy that we're going to expend. 
So that's sort of the generic strategic narrative around it. My personal view is I absolutely think, on average, 1 to 3 MTS kinds of deals a year seems to be a reasonable -- something that absolutely is achievable. We're not going to try to sort of force a deal every year on that. So some years are going to be 0 because the circumstances are not going to present -- the circumstances that we're looking for are not going to present themselves. But I think there's lots of room for other similar kinds of deals to be additive to what we're doing in a relatively consistent way over, let's say, the 5-year period. I think I'll stop there."

I would say, for sure, in the second quarter, there are broader issues than just automotive at play. And I would also say that it's absolutely fair that we are having to work a lot harder in terms of securing our own sources of supply than we would under normal circumstances. So we have, for a number of reasons, I think, been able to counterpunch our way through a much more challenging supply environment in the first quarter. 
And through the second quarter, I think we're going to be able to do the same, broadly speaking, partly because we source local -- that's -- we know our suppliers. We source where we produce and I think partly because of our -- the fact that we stayed invested. We hang on to our people, so we're not having to add people back to support this uptick in demand. But it's -- I don't want to -- no one should take from that, that it's been smooth and easy the whole way through. So we're in the soup with everybody else and certainly having to work harder than normal to sustain our ability to supply. But I think so far, I feel like we've been able to, as I said, counterpunch our way through it pretty well. 
And I would also say beyond the automotive space, there are certainly some pockets where we have some other -- some of our customers being impacted by some of their own supply chain issues. Plastics remain tight, a number of areas. I don't think anything is sort of concentrated and significant as in auto, but it's certainly a scramble right now on a lot of levels, no question."

I mean I think the one obvious one, Scott, is the auto business, where just given the nature of the business and how the contracts are structured, getting price takes a little longer and requires a funnel of new products that are coming in at more attractive margins.

And the other 6 segments, I think there's -- given the differentiated nature of our -- the products and services that we provide, we have a long history of being able to offset any cost increases with price. There's typically a little bit of a lag. I will tell you we learned some things. When we went through this in 2018, we are -- we're definitely much more, I'd say, focused and on top of things earlier on. And our divisions are taking the actions that are required to kind of stay ahead of things this time around. 
So while there's certainly some pressure here, you saw 60 basis points of margin percentage impact and 7 percentage points of incremental margin impact. The overall goal here is to offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and we're confident that we'll be able to do that for the year and in total, even with the pressure and the difficulty in automotive."

I don't think size is a barrier at all or a limitation or something that would scare us away. I'd point to MTS as being -- it's not quite $0.5 billion in annual revenue, so it's not a small business by any stretch. I'd tell you a couple of things. One is that we have never been more prepared from the standpoint of discipline around integration. Our -- the quality of practice around our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, the depth of talent, this is all a result of the last 9 years of work on this. So all of that certainly is just additive to, I think, our ability to -- if we find the right opportunity to do a really good job with it. So it's not an issue of -- size doesn't scare us. 
I think sometimes what does happen is the larger the size, there tends to be -- it's a sign to sort of a pure play -- this is the part of the business. We want it all. The bigger the asset, the more sort of nonstrategic, non-desirable stuff you have to deal with sometimes. But that's also just sort of part of the tactics. But again, I don't think it's big or small that is the driving benefit to us as much as does it really fit with what we're good at, does it fit an area of the market we think has long-term above-market organic growth prospects, et cetera. And whether it's large or relatively small, and by that, I mean division size, those would be equally attractive options to us."

I'm trying to think about how to sort of tackle that one, John. It's -- maybe the place to start is, inherent in our system is -- we always talk about the fact that we produce today what our customers bought yesterday. So inherent in that -- what makes that work is the fact that we are always carrying surplus capacity. So -- on the order of magnitude of 15% to 20% over what current demand is because that demand comes in -- it's an average on a daily basis. So the only way we can produce today what our customers bought yesterday as that number moves up and down is to make sure that we have ample extra capacity to flex. So that sort of helps us. 
As things accelerate, we do have a cushion to lean on. We also have -- our supplier base is connected into that system in a way that they're also carrying that kind of ability to flex. Now it works really well. It doesn't work perfectly, certainly with -- we have our sort of rubs and issues along the way, and I'm sure we will. But they are things that we can overcome and work our way through. But maybe that's the best answer.

And so those are businesses that are more driven by investment in CapEx. And I think as the visibility to the recovery and the confidence in the recovery takes hold, our customers are placing orders for larger equipment. And we saw a little bit of that also in Specialty Products, on the packaging equipment side. And it's really a broad-based trend. So I don't really have the breakdown for you on a global basis. But really across the board, we saw really nice pickup in demand for the CapEx-driven products and those 3 businesses in particular.

My personal view, Ann, is that's maybe not even such a bad thing in terms of extending the duration of the recovery and sort of managing the pace a little bit in the short run. So even with these auto, auto is a real extreme example of that, not so much on labor, but from semiconductor chips. 
Michael talked about the fact that consumer demand for autos is strong. Dealer inventories are at, I think, around the world, historic lows. So the fact that all of that is not trying to be satisfied in 2 quarters and it actually gets spread out, and so I just use that same analogy in places like Food Equipment, as I don't think it's necessarily a terrible thing that there are some limitations, either labor or other things, as we move through the recovery in some of our sectors. 
It doesn't mean demand isn't going to grow. It's just -- it's not going to be this feeding frenzy of satisfying in a relatively short period of time. And so I don't know exactly how it's all going to play out, but I don't think some of those limitations in the near term are necessarily bad things for the long haul, if that makes sense."

If I look at your business, it seems to me that this vertical, this segment is really the one that's probably been transformed the most by COVID in terms of sort of the end customers having to operate differently, having to think about doing business differently. And I'm sort of wondering where that leads you strategically longer term, right? Because the industry is consolidating. You obviously have an important market position and really good product. How do you think about the next 5 years from an innovation standpoint, from ability to gain share, more and importantly, you sort of stepping up to the plate and consolidating the industry as well because there are a lot of smaller players that are still out there."

And so whether the industry consolidates or not, ultimately, we compete based on our ability to deliver superior value to the customers that we choose to target in those industries. And so that's essentially all I'll say is our -- our businesses are very well positioned in this space. We expect that they will continue to grow at an accelerated rate with best-in-class margins and returns in that industry. And absolutely, to your point, we will have to continue to evolve and innovate as our customers evolve and innovate based on COVID or anything else in terms of what happens in that industry.

I think on price/cost, I mean, what we're talking about right now is this pretty significant increase in raw material costs and offsetting those dollar-for-dollar with price. And in the near term, as I said, that puts pressure on margins. I think once you get past the surge in raw material costs and those start to kind of stabilize or maybe even come down a little bit as expected, frankly, for some of these commodities in the back half of the year, you're holding on to the price, and you're going to end up in a favorable position again from a price/cost standpoint. That's kind of how this has played out historically.
And historically, that's what's been embedded in that 35% to 40% incremental margin rate that we've been able to put up. I think once we go through kind of the planning for 2022, I'll give you a better feel for the ability to maintain incremental margins, either above the historical range or in the historical range. But as we sit here today, like I said earlier, I would -- for modeling purposes, I would stick to the 35% to 40% for now, and we'll give you an update as we go through the year here. 
But clearly, this year and in Q1 and in the near term, really strong incremental margin performance. I don't know if I said this, but we're above the range of 35% to 40%, so 40% plus, and that's with price/cost for the full year. Headwinds are somewhere around 4 to 5 percentage points to the incremental margin. So really strong performance here as the recovery takes hold."

So from a strategic standpoint, these are still businesses that we are -- that are not a great fit for ITW, that are a much better fit, frankly, with other people, we think.

I mean we're clearly -- as the top line grows 10%, you're going to see, at least in the near term, a corresponding increase in inventory levels, which is part of what Scott talked about. As demand grows, inventory levels are going to grow. The same thing with receivables. The fact that receivables are growing is actually -- as you know, it's a good thing. I think what we keep an eye on is the working capital metrics around inventory months on hand are all trending in the right direction. 
I'll just point out that if you look at our -- you can't see it looking in from the outside. But when we look at our receivable aging and our bad debt, we are below pre-COVID levels in a meaningful way. So I think the teams really did an excellent job managing working capital overall, including receivables last year. 
And I think we talked about in the last call, working capital headwinds, somewhere around $125 million was in the plan for this year. The growth is a little bit stronger, so it might be a little bit more than that, but it's not going to change. We still are confident we'll get to 100% plus conversion rate, but the goal here really is -- we generate plenty of cash. The goal here is to grow the company. It would make no sense for us to try to hold back on inventory levels at this point. 
So on CapEx, as you know, last year, some of the capacity expansions were deferred. A lot of those are coming back now. CapEx will be somewhere around 2% of sales, which is where it has been historically. That is not a set number. That's an outcome of how we allocate capital. So if you pencil in somewhere around $300 million that -- directionally, that's probably where we'll end up. That's up. I think last year, we did $236 million or something like that. So we're definitely expanding. And you saw the CapEx number moved up a little bit here in the first quarter, and that's really as these capacity expansions are -- we're adding equipment. We're adding injection molding machines in auto and other places to support our customers as the -- as demand recovers. So..."

That's the one area where there's quite a bit of uncertainty particularly. And I'll just maybe reiterate this, be a little cautious around the second quarter here and not get too excited.

In the second quarter, we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results.

In the second quarter, we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results. Revenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%, and we saw double-digit growth in every segment and geography. Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the onetime tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter. 
In this strong demand environment and in the face of very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long-held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach and the benefits of staying fully staffed and invested through our winter recovery positioning, to continue providing world-class service levels to our customers while also continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. 
We're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remained pretty much strong across the board. And during the second quarter, we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses. 
While there's no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years at ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers. We've worked hard over the last 9 years to position ITW to deliver differentiated performance in any environment, and I have no doubt that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level as we move through the balance of the year and beyond. 
Now for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across our 7 segments. The 2 segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter, with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%. By geography, North America was up 36% and international was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.  GAAP EPS of $2.45 was up 143% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there. Excluding this item, EPS of $2.10 grew 108%. It was a Q2 record and was 10% higher than in Q2 of 2019. 
Operating income increased 99% and incremental margin was 40% at the enterprise level. Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives. Year-to-date, our teams have delivered robust margin expansion, with incremental margins for our 7 segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price/cost impact. 
Speaking of price/cost, price/cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points. While the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year, consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In Q2, we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result, net price/cost impact reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter. We continue to expect price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the year, and I'll come back and provide more color on the price/cost environment a little later in my remarks. 
In the quarter, after-tax return on invested capital was a record at 30.8%. Free cash flow was $477 million with a conversion of 72% of net income when adjusted for the onetime tax benefit I mentioned earlier. And that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth. We continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year. We repurchased $250 million of our shares this quarter as planned. And finally, our tax rate in the quarter was 10.1% due to the onetime tax benefit. Excluding this item, our Q2 tax rate was 23%. 
Now moving to Slide 4 for an update on price/cost. We continue to experience raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals and now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost 5 percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began. And just for some perspective, this is roughly 2x what we experienced in the 2018 inflation tariff cycle. 
We learned a lot from that experience. And as a result, the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions are well ahead of where we were in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the full year, with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Price/cost will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage, however, in the near term, as we saw in Q2, and that impact will likely be modestly higher in Q3 versus Q2 before it starts to go the other way. For the full year, we expect price/cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.
That being said, margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative effect of price/cost on margin percentage and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year. And beyond the near-term price/cost impact, we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for some comments on our segment performance in Q2. Chris?"

Starting on Slide 5, the table on the left provides some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses with a look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2. As you would expect, the pace of recovery in our",875,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, the table on the left provides some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses with a look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2. As you would expect, the pace of recovery in our Auto OEM segment has been dampened by the well-publicized shortage of semiconductor chips despite very strong underlying demand. And for that reason, we added a row to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex Auto. 
Our Q2 revenue ex Auto increased 8% versus Q1. This year, Q2 had 1 more shipping day than Q1, so on an equal days basis, our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth ex Auto is 6%, which is 2x of our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonality of plus 3%. In addition, we added more than $200 million of backlog in Q2. Both of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in Q2 across our portfolio. 
So let's go to a little more detail for each segment, starting with Automotive OEM. Demand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84% organic growth. This, of course, was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May. North America was up 102%, Europe was up 106% and China up 20%. We estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter. 
Operating margin of 18.8% was up 26.6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Price/cost was a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the longer cycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment. Given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in Automotive to be approximately 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year. To be clear, this is not lost revenue but simply delayed into next year. Furthermore, the slower-than-expected growth in Auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for Food Equipment. In Food Equipment, organic revenue rebounded 46%, with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. North America was up 39% with equipment up 42% and service up 33%. Institutional revenue was up more than 30%, with health care and education growth in the low to mid-30s and [ lodging ] up in the mid-20s. Restaurants were up about 60% with the largest year-over-year increases in full service and QSR. Retail grew in the mid-teens in continued solid demand and new product rollouts. 
International recovery was also robust at 58%, with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%. Equipment sales were strong, up 66% with service growth of 39%, which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in Europe. Operating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%. Test & Measurement was up 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer CapEx spend and continued strength in semicon. Electronics grew 38%, continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in electronic assembly. Operating margin of 28.1% was 240 basis points -- was up 240 basis points and a Q2 record. 
Moving to Slide 7. Welding growth was also strong in Q2 at 33%. Equipment revenue was up 38% and consumables growth of 25% was the first time in positive territory since 2019. Our Industrial business grew 52% on increased CapEx spending by our customers, and the commercial business remains solid, up 26%, following 17% growth in the first quarter. North America was up 38% and international growth was 13%, primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas. 
Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 28%, led by our automotive aftermarket business of 33% on robust retail sales. Polymers was up 34% with continued momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries. Fluids was up 8% with North America growth in the mid-teens and European sales up low single digits. Operating margin was an all-time record 27.3% with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partly offset by price/cost. 
Moving to Slide 8. Construction organic growth of 28% reflected double-digit growth and recovery in all 3 regions. North America was up 20%, with 16% growth in residential renovation and with 26% growth in commercial construction. Europe grew 61% with strong recovery versus easy comps in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand organic growth was 13%, with continued strength in residential and commercial. Operating margin in the segment of 27.6% was up 390 basis points and was a Q2 record. 
Specialty organic revenue was up 17% with North America up 15%, Europe up 24% and Asia Pacific up 14%. Our flexible packaging business was up mid-single digits against a tougher comp than the rest of this segment. The majority of our businesses were up double digits, led by appliance up more than 50%. Consumable sales were up 19% and equipment sales up 12%. And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott."

Let's move on to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance.

Let's move on to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus 3%. This is an increase in organic growth of 1 percentage point at the midpoint versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of Q1, driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases. 
While demand momentum accelerated in Q2 versus Q1, as we noted earlier in our presentation, we are admittedly being conservative in not projecting that forward in our guidance at this point in time, given the significant supply chain disruptions that continue to challenge many of our customers in Auto and otherwise. 
We are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the onetime tax benefit realized in the second quarter. The midpoint of $8.75 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019. Factoring out the onetime Q2 tax item, the midpoint of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019. 
With regard to margin percentage, as discussed earlier, the incremental cost increases that we saw in Q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we projected as of the end of Q1. And we are adjusting our margin percentage guidance accordingly to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year-over-year and an all-time record for the company. And again, we expect 0 EPS impact from price/cost for the full year. 
We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income, factoring out the impact of the onetime noncash tax benefit we recorded in Q2. Through the first half, we have repurchased $500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional $500 million in the second half. Finally, we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for a full year tax rate of around 20%. 
Lastly, today's guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to close later this year. And once that acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update. And with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Karen."

I'll give you some overall color and then certainly let Chris give you some segment-level -- business-level specifics if some things come to mind for him on this. I would say in terms of overall color, as we talk to our businesses around the world, there's no question that it is a daily battle that -- to maintain supply position necessarily to service our customers. I would absolutely contend that we are doing better than most for a couple of reasons. One is the fact that we have long had localized supply relationships with local manufacturing facilities serving our customers locally. 
We have -- and then the other factor is what we talked about in our remarks, the fact that we kept all our people through the pandemic. We have not had to scramble to bring people back. So normally, our supply chain and our manufacturing operations function in a very simple automated way. It's definitely taking a lot more, let's call it, boot force for now. But I think we're not hearing any big issues from the standpoint of our own ability to supply our customers. It doesn't mean that there's not an occasional $2 bracket that shows up late in the -- there's a couple of well machines that can't go. I'm just making that up, but that's -- I'm sure that's the case. 
But ultimately, given the service levels that we're monitoring as a standard part of our operating practices, I would say that I'm very comfortable saying that we're working a lot harder than we normally have to but ultimately performing pretty well. I would say that the supply chain area beyond Auto is much more of an issue for us on the demand side than the supply side. And I'd point to a couple of things. But we are seeing a lot of sort of timing changes in terms of orders and requirements, not because we can't deliver something but because another supplier can't deliver something to a customer. 
And I'd also point to the $200 million of backlog. We've talked about this before. We ship basically today what our customers ordered yesterday, and so we operate with very little backlog. And the fact that we built a couple of hundred million dollars of backlog, I can't analyze every dollar of it, but my contention would be that, that's a lot more due to sort of customer delays than it is our own ability to supply.

Obviously, we talked about where it's going in a different way. But certainly, in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement and Electronics and Welding are certainly growing faster than we expected earlier in the year, so we see nice acceleration there. We have no reason to believe that it's not sustainable based on our conversations with our customers, the order patterns and so on. 
And obviously, as we walked and talked about the fact we've been very busy here in terms of this win recovery initiative over the last 12 months. And is it still kind of early to quantify this? We're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned. And we -- as you know, we very intentionally remain fully staffed to serve our customers, protect investments in people and initiatives a customer-back innovation and sales excellence. And we certainly a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that would say that, that is turning into real share gains. 
And if I just maybe highlight some sort of examples in like Food Equipment, where high levels of product availability, maintaining service level excellence, as Scott talked about, and being able to respond and supply where a competitor could not is enabling several share gain and incremental wins from competition in large chains, both in foodservice and food retail. 
Another example might be in Polymers & Fluids, automotive aftermarket. Staying invested here, we're able to sustain sales and our sales and innovation focus, coupled with high service levels means we grew, as I mentioned in the commentary, automotive aftermarket grew by 33% in the quarter. And this is well above customer point sales growth, indicating that we are getting share in a meaningful way. And even on residential construction in our roofing businesses -- business which is up 45% in the quarter, again, we see very clearly we're gaining share there on competition who have certainly been supply chain and operationally constrained, extending delivery times and so on, and we continue to maintain differentiated service levels. 
So again, somewhat anecdotal, somewhat early in the winter recovery strategy but certainly ample evidence that we seem to be gaining share. And these are just a small selection of illustrative examples of the type of products that we're making across our 7 segments."

So if this is impacting the back half of the year primarily, then at least presumably, you have a couple of points of growth just from pricing in the back half. If I look at the implied guidance, right, at the high end, we're talking about growing something like 7% organically. A couple of points of that is, is there incremental price? 
And I mean look, Scott, you were talking earlier saying, ""Hey, I'm trying to take a conservative approach here."" But at least to me, when I'm adjusting out for this pricing element and I think about the comparisons that are still fairly easy relative to the prior year, it just strikes me that you really are being conservative here in terms of how you're thinking about your business progression on a fixed price, call it, core basis. So just to kind of clarify this, is it that there is some lack of clarity as to where maybe demand is going to be because of what's happening with the supply chain? Or is it that you're having some second thoughts with regards to how you're going to be able to convert revenue, given your -- some of the disruptions that you're having to deal with?"

Bigger risk for us, by far, is customer supply chain and what that does to their demand patterns from here on out. It is, as I said before, it's about as volatile of a situation as I've seen in my career at ITW. And so I don't -- I'm not trying to be mysterious about it. I think until we see that start to stabilize, it's just really hard to be comfortable sort of raising -- I know we're serving the demand we have today really well and the sort of run rate from the standpoint that our customers are able to sustain. I think we're comfortable continue to -- that our ability to do that will continue on for the back half. 
There is a lot more orders and a lot more demand than -- that's, again, why we built backlog that's -- there's not a demand question. If we had our customers had sort of unimpaired supply chains right now, we'd probably had 10 more points in the second quarter. I'm this -- it's not a fact, that's just my opinion but just looking at the backlog. And so I think demand is certainly much stronger right now. Given the pace of the recovery, it's just a matter of, from the standpoint of all the supply chain issues and risks for our customers, they're a pace of being able to what they're ultimately going to be from us. As I said, it's just hard to justify going up with a lot of confidence from here, but it's more their supply side than their demand side, if that makes sense."

Generally speaking, months on hand runs roughly 2.5 months. DSO, I can't remember off the top of my head, but whatever the average is, 60-ish maybe. So that's where working capital is going to go. Sales go up, months on hand is not going to go up but the dollars invested, if [ today's ] to stay at that month, going to go up, same with receivables in terms of DSO. 
So it's not a -- it's something that happens automatically. We don't have to sort of force that to happen. But if sales go up, inventory is going to go up, like the months on hand is a function of that's how 80/20 works. There's some elements of it that give us -- we want X amount of inventory to be able to provide the ability to react and respond to our customers that order today, ship tomorrow kind of system. 
So I think that's the best guide I can give you on working capital is just model that through and whether that's cash flow. It's not going to be -- when you're jumping up as much as we did in Q2 versus Q1, it's going to obviously require some incremental working capital.

But in terms of the end markets, I mean, basically with food, we're back to about -- by the end of this year, we expected back over 90% of the 2019 number so faster than we thought. And in terms of end markets, we're seeing nice pickup in institutional, restaurants going back. We mentioned restaurants being up 60%. 
In terms of stuff that's coming back a little slower, I would say service. If we point to service in Europe, as an example, obviously with the significant lockdowns, we're still dealing with over there, probably coming back a little slower there.

In the second quarter, we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results. Revenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%, and we saw double-digit growth in every segment and geography. Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the onetime tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.  
In this strong demand environment and in the face of very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long-held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits of staying fully staffed and invested through our winter recovery positioning, to continue providing world-class service levels to our customers while also continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.  
We're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remained pretty much strong across the board. And during the second quarter, we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses.  
While there's no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years at ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers. We've worked hard over the last 9 years to position ITW to deliver differentiated performance in any environment, and I have no doubt that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level as we move through the balance of the year and beyond.  
Now for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across our 7 segments. The 2 segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter, with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%. By geography, North America was up 36% and international was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.  GAAP EPS of $2.45 was up 143% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there. Excluding this item, EPS of $2.10 grew 108%. It was a Q2 record and was 10% higher than in Q2 of 2019.  
Operating income increased 99% and incremental margin was 40% at the enterprise level. Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives. Year-to-date, our teams have delivered robust margin expansion, with incremental margins for our 7 segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price/cost impact.  
Speaking of price/cost, price/cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points. While the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year, consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In Q2, we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result, net price/cost impact reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter. We continue to expect price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the year, and I'll come back and provide more color on the price/cost environment a little later in my remarks.  
In the quarter, after-tax return on invested capital was a record at 30.8%. Free cash flow was $477 million, with a conversion of 72% of net income when adjusted for the onetime tax benefit I mentioned earlier. And that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth. We continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year. We repurchased $250 million of our shares this quarter as planned. And finally, our tax rate in the quarter was 10.1% due to the onetime tax benefit. Excluding this item, our Q2 tax rate was 23%.  
Now moving to Slide 4 for an update on price/cost. We continue to experience raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals and now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost 5 percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began. And just for some perspective, this is roughly 2x what we experienced in the 2018 inflation tariff cycle.  
We learned a lot from that experience. And as a result, the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions are well ahead of where we were in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the full year, with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Price/cost will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage, however, in the near term, as we saw in Q2, and that impact will likely be modestly higher in Q3 versus Q2 before it starts to go the other way. For the full year, we expect price/cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1. 
That being said, margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative effect of price/cost on margin percentage and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year. And beyond the near-term price/cost impact, we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for some comments on our segment performance in Q2. Chris?"

Starting on Slide 5, the table on the left provides some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses with a look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2. As you would expect, the pace of recovery in our",873,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, the table on the left provides some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses with a look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2. As you would expect, the pace of recovery in our Auto OEM segment has been dampened by the well-publicized shortage of semiconductor chips despite very strong underlying demand. And for that reason, we added a row to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex Auto.  
Our Q2 revenue ex Auto increased 8% versus Q1. This year, Q2 had one more shipping day than Q1, so on an equal days basis, our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth ex Auto is 6%, which is 2x of our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonality of plus 3%. In addition, we added more than $200 million of backlog in Q2. Both of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in Q2 across our portfolio.  
So let's go to a little more detail for each segment, starting with Automotive OEM. Demand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84% organic growth. This, of course, was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May. North America was up 102%, Europe was up 106% and China up 20%. We estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter.  
Operating margin of 18.8% was up 26.6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Price/cost with a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the longer cycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment. Given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in Automotive to be approximately 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year. To be clear, this is not lost revenue but simply delayed into next year. Furthermore, the slower-than-expected growth in Auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise.  
Please turn to Slide 6 for Food Equipment. In Food Equipment, organic revenue rebounded 46%, with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. North America was up 39% with equipment up 42% and service up 33%. Institutional revenue was up more than 30%, with health care and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s. Restaurants were up about 60% with the largest year-over-year increases in full service and QSR. Retail grew in the mid-teens on continued solid demand and new product rollouts.  
International recovery was also robust at 58%, with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%. Equipment sales were strong, up 66% with service growth of 39%, which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in Europe. Operating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%. Test & Measurement was up 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer CapEx spend and continued strength in semicon. Electronics grew 38%, continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in electronic assembly. Operating margin of 28.1% was 240 basis points -- was up 240 basis points and a Q2 record.  
Moving to Slide 7. Welding growth was also strong in Q2 at 33%. Equipment revenue was up 38% and consumables growth of 25% was the first time in positive territory since 2019. Our industrial business grew 52% on increased CapEx spending by our customers, and the commercial business remains solid, up 26%, following 17% growth in the first quarter. North America was up 38% and international growth was 13%, primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas.  
Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 28%, led by our automotive aftermarket business up 33% on robust retail sales. Polymers was up 34% with continued momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries. Fluids was up 8% with North America growth in the mid-teens and European sales up low single digits. Operating margin was an all-time record 27.3% with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partly offset by price/cost.  
Moving to Slide 8. Construction organic growth of 28% reflected double-digit growth and recovery in all 3 regions. North America was up 20%, with 16% growth in residential renovation and with 26% growth in commercial construction. Europe grew 61% with strong recovery versus easy comps in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand organic growth was 13%, with continued strength in residential and commercial. Operating margin in the segment of 27.6% was up 390 basis points and was a Q2 record.  
Specialty organic revenue was up 17% with North America up 15%, Europe up 24% and Asia Pacific up 14%. Our flexible packaging business was up mid-single digits against a tougher comp than the rest of this segment. The majority of our businesses were up double digits, led by appliance up more than 50%. Consumable sales were up 19% and equipment sales up 12%. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott."

Let's move on to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to",439,"Thanks, Chris. Let's move on to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus 3%. This is an increase in organic growth of 1 percentage point at the midpoint versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of Q1, driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases.  
While demand momentum accelerated in Q2 versus Q1, as we noted earlier in our presentation, we are admittedly being conservative in not projecting that forward in our guidance at this point in time, given the significant supply chain disruptions that continue to challenge many of our customers in Auto and otherwise.  
We are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the onetime tax benefit realized in the second quarter. The midpoint of $8.75 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019. Factoring out the onetime Q2 tax item, the midpoint of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019.  
With regard to margin percentage, as discussed earlier, the incremental cost increases that we saw in Q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we projected as of the end of Q1. And we are adjusting our margin percentage guidance accordingly to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year-over-year and an all-time record for the company. And again, we expect 0 EPS impact from price/cost for the full year.  
We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income, factoring out the impact of the onetime noncash tax benefit we recorded in Q2. Through the first half, we have repurchased $500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional $500 million in the second half. Finally, we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for a full year tax rate of around 20%.  
Lastly, today's guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to close later this year. And once that acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update. And with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Karen."

One is the fact that we have long-head localized supply relationships with local manufacturing facilities serving our customers locally. 
We have -- and then the other factor is what we talked about in our remarks, the fact that we kept all our people through the pandemic. We have not had to scramble to bring people back. So normally, our supply chain and our manufacturing operations function in a very simple automated way. It's definitely taking a lot more, let's call it, boot force for now. But I think that we're not hearing any big issues from the standpoint of our own ability to supply our customers. It doesn't mean that there's not an occasional $2 bracket that shows up late in the -- there's a couple of welding machines that can't go. I'm just making that up, but that's -- I'm sure that's the case. 
But ultimately, given the service levels that we're monitoring as a standard part of our operating practices, I would say that I'm very comfortable saying that we're working a lot harder than we normally have to but ultimately performing pretty well. I would say that the supply chain area beyond Auto is much more of an issue for us on the demand side than the supply side. And I'd point to a couple of things. We are seeing a lot of sort of timing changes in terms of orders and requirements, not because we can't deliver something but because another supplier can't deliver something to a customer. 
And I'd also point to the $200 million of backlog, and we've talked about this before. We ship basically today what our customers ordered yesterday, and so we operate with very little backlog. And the fact that we built a couple of hundred million dollars of backlog, I can't analyze every dollar of it, but my contention would be that, that's a lot more due to sort of customer delays than it is our own ability to supply. And look, that was -- the $60 million in Auto plus the $200 million in backlog, that's another 10 percentage points of organic growth in the second quarter. Again, I'm not necessarily contending that all of it could have gone but my bet would be most of it. I don't know if you have anything you want to add."

A key part of our strategy, and it's working very well for us for many years, is to have these very strong and long-lasting supplier partnerships.

And until we see how things play out, it just didn't make sense to take things too far from where they are now in terms of run rate until we see how that all -- how the supply issues play out in affecting our customers' willingness to -- ability to take what they've ordered from us and order more.

Obviously, we talked about where it's going in a different way. But certainly, in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement and Electronics and Welding are certainly growing faster than we expected earlier in the year, so we see nice acceleration there. We have no reason to believe that it's not sustainable based on our conversations with our customers, the order patterns and so on. 
And, obviously, as we walked and talked about the fact we've been very busy here in terms of this winter recovery initiative over the last 12 months. And well, is it still kind of early to quantify this? We're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned. And we -- as you know, we very intentionally remain fully staffed to serve our customers, protect investments in people and initiatives, our customer-back innovation and so just sales excellence. And we certainly have anecdotal evidence out there that would say that, that is turning into real share gains. 
And if I just maybe highlight some sort of examples in like Food Equipment, where high levels of product availability, maintaining service-level excellence, as Scott talked about, and being able to respond and supply where our competitor could not is enabling several share gain and incremental wins from competition in large chains, both in foodservice and food retail. 
Another example might be in Polymers & Fluids, automotive aftermarket. Staying invested here, we're able to sustain sales. And our sales and innovation focus, coupled with high service levels means we grew, as I mentioned in the commentary, automotive aftermarket grew by 33% in the quarter. And this is well above customer point sales growth, indicating that we are getting share in a meaningful way. And even on residential construction in our roofing businesses -- a business which is up 45% in the quarter, again, we see very clearly we're gaining share there on competition who have certainly been supply chain and operationally constrained, extending delivery times and so on, and we continue to maintain differentiated service levels. 
So again, somewhat anecdotal, somewhat early in the winter recovery strategy, but certainly ample evidence that we seem to be gaining share. And these are just a small selection of illustrative examples of the type of products that we're making across our 7 segments."

The other thing I'd say to you is that we've got a very similar business in our portfolio in Test & Measurement and Instron, where we've done this successfully before.

So if this is impacting the back half of the year primarily, then at least presumably, you have a couple of points of growth just from pricing in the back half. If I look at the implied guidance, right, at the high end, we're talking about growing something like 7% organically. A couple of points of that is, is there incremental price? 
And I mean look, Scott, you were talking earlier saying, ""Hey, I'm trying to take a conservative approach here."" But at least to me, when I'm adjusting out for this pricing element and I think about the comparisons that are still fairly easy, relative to the prior year, it just strikes me that you really are being conservative here in terms of how you're thinking about your business progression on a fixed price, call it, core basis. So just to kind of clarify this, is it that there is some lack of clarity as to where maybe demand is going to be because of what's happening with the supply chain? Or is it that you're having some second thoughts with regards to how you're going to be able to convert revenue, given your -- some of the disruptions that you're having to deal with?"

Bigger risk for us, by far, is customer supply chain and what that does to their demand patterns from here on out. It is -- as I said before, it's about as volatile of a situation as I've seen in my career at ITW. And so I don't -- I'm not trying to be mysterious about it. I think until we see that starts to stabilize, it's just really hard to be comfortable sort of raising -- I know we're serving the demand we have today really well and the sort of run rate from the standpoint that our customers are able to sustain. And I think we're comfortable to continue to -- our ability to do that will continue on for the back half. 
There's a lot more orders and a lot more demand than -- that's, again, why we built backlog that's -- there's not a demand question. If we had our customers had sort of unimpaired supply chains right now, we'd probably had 10 more points in the second quarter. And this is -- it's not a fact, that's just my opinion, but just looking at the backlog. And so I think demand is certainly much stronger right now. Given the pace of the recovery, it's just a matter of, from the standpoint of all the supply chain issues and risks for our customers, their pace of being able to -- what they're ultimately going to need from us, as I said, it's just hard to justify going up with a lot of confidence from here, but it's more their supply side than their demand side, if that makes sense."

I forgot what it was, less than a month, maybe less than a month, I think I saw.

Generally speaking, months on hand runs roughly 2.5 months. DSO, I can't remember off the top of my head, but whatever the average is, 60-ish maybe. So that's where working capital is going to go. Sales go up, months on hand is not going to go up, but the dollars invested, if today is to stay at that month on hand, going to go up, same with receivables in terms of DSO. 
So it's not a -- it's something that happens automatically. We don't have to sort of force that to happen. But if sales go up, inventory is going to go up. That's months on hand is a function of, that's how 80/20 works. There's some elements of it that give us -- we want x amount of inventory to be able to provide the ability to react and respond to our customers, that order today, ship tomorrow kind of system. 
So I think that's the best guide I can give you on working capital, is just model that through and whether that's cash flow. It's not going to be -- when you're jumping up as much as we did in Q2 versus Q1, it's going to obviously require some incremental working capital.

A little bit of price/cost impact in food, certainly, but then, obviously, that's -- some of that relates to the fact that the price/cost environment, some additional pricing actions here in the second half. But in terms of the end markets, I mean, basically with food, we're back to about -- by the end of this year, we expected back over 90% of the 2019 number so faster than we thought. And in terms of end markets, we're seeing nice pickup in institutional, restaurants going back. We mentioned restaurants being up 60%. 
In terms of stuff that's coming back a little slower, I would say service. If we point to service in Europe, as an example, obviously with the significant lockdowns we're still dealing with over there, we'll probably come back a little slower there, at least through the first half.

At the segment level, organic growth was led by welding at plus 22%; food equipment at plus 19%; Test & Measurement and Electronics at plus 12% and specialty products at plus 8% Our automotive OE segment continued to be impacted in the near term by auto production cutbacks associated with the well-publicized supply chain challenges affecting our auto customers. 
In Q3, auto production cutbacks ended up being significantly larger than what was projected heading into the quarter. And as a result, our auto OEM segment revenues were down 11% in Q3 versus the minus 2% we were expecting as of the end of June. 
In a very challenging environment, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of executing for our customers and for the company. 
In Q3, our people leveraged the combination of ITW's robust and highly flexible front-to-back operating system. The company is close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain capabilities and systems and our decision to stay fully staffed and invested through the pandemic to sustain world-class service levels for our customers. 
They also executed appropriate and timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs. And as a result, we were able to fully offset input cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in Q3, resulting in 0 EPS impact from price cost in the quarter. 
And, by the way, our teams also managed to continue to drive progress on our long-term strategy, execute on our window recovery positioning initiative and deliver another 100 basis points of margin improvement benefit from enterprise initiatives. 
Moving forward, we remain very focused on sustaining our growth momentum and are fully leveraging the competitive strength of the ITW business model and the investments we have made and continue to make in support of the execution of our enterprise strategy. 
Before turning it over to Michael, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for all their efforts and for their dedication to keeping themselves and their ITW colleagues safe to serving our customers with excellence and to driving continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. 
Michael, over to you."

As Scott said, demand remained strong in Q3 with total revenue of $3.6 billion an increase of 8% with organic growth of 6%. Growth was positive in 6 or 7 segments, ranging from 3% to 22% and in all geographic regions, led by North America, up 9%; Europe, up 1% and; Asia, up 5%. 
Channel was up 2% versus prior year and up 6% sequentially. GAAP EPS of $2.02 was up 10% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.06. Operating income increased 7% and operating margin was flat at 23.8% despite significant price cost headwinds. Enterprise Initiatives were real positive again this quarter at 100 basis points, as was volume leverage, which contributed more than 100 basis points. Thanks to a great effort by our businesses, price cost was EPS-neutral but still dilutive to operating margin percentage by 200 basis points as raw material cost increases further escalated in the third quarter. 
Throughout 2021, our businesses have quickly and decisively responded to raw material and logistics cost inflation with pricing actions in alignment with our policy to fully offset these cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we've talked about this before, but given the current environment, I'll remind you that we don't hedge. So current cost inflation is always moving through our businesses in real time. 
After-tax return on invested capital was 28.5% and free cash flow was $548 million. Free cash flow conversion was 86% as our businesses have been very intentional about adding inventory to both support our growth and to mitigate supply chain risk and sustained world-class service levels for our customers. 
Overall, for the quarter, then strong growth in 6 of 7 segments and excellent operational and financial execution across the board. 
Let's go to Slide 4 for segment results. And before we get to the segment detail, the data on the left side of the slide illustrates our strong Q3 results with and without automotive OEM. I wanted to highlight 2 key points. The first is the benefit we derive from our high-quality diversified business portfolio in terms of the strength, resilience and consistency of ITW's financial performance. which is enabling us, in this case, to power through significant near-term headwinds in our largest segment and still deliver top-tier overall performance. 
The second is the accelerating growth momentum with strong core earnings leverage we're generating across the company. Excluding our auto OEM segment, given the issues affecting that market right now, the rest of the company collectively delivered organic growth of 11%. Operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 25% plus in Q3. 
As you can see on this slide, if you eliminate the price/cost impact, our core incrementals were a very strong 52% in the third quarter, which points to the quality of growth and profitability leverage that define the core focus of our business model and strategy. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment performance in Q3, beginning with automotive OEM on the right side of this page. Organic revenue was down 11%, with North America down 12%; Europe, down 18%; and China, up 2%. 
And as Scott mentioned, supply chain-related production cutbacks were much larger in Q3 than what we and most, if not all, external auto industry forecasters were expecting heading into the quarter. 
While conditions in the auto market are obviously very challenging in the near term, but really good news from our standpoint is that the eventual and inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major source of growth for ITW over an extended period of time once the current supply chain issues begin to improve and ultimately get resolved. 
Between now and whenever that is, we will remain fully invested and strongly positioned to support our customers and seize incremental share gain opportunities as production accelerates coming out the other side of this situation. 
Turning to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, and organic revenue growth was very strong at 19% and the Food Equipment recovery that began in Q2 continues to gain strength. North America was up 18% with equipment up 20% and service up 14%. Institutional revenue, which is about 1/3 of our revenue, increased more than 20%, with strength in education, up over 40% and health care and lodging growth of around 20%. Restaurants were up almost 50% with strength across the board. Strong demand is evident internationally as well with Europe up 20% and Asia Pacific, up 23%. Equipment sales led the way up 26% with service growth of 8%. In our view, this segment is in the early stages of recovery as evidenced by revenues that are still below pre-COVID levels. 
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was strong with growth of 12%. Test & Measurement was up 15%, driven by continued strength in customer CapEx spend and in our businesses that serve the semiconductor space. Electronics grew 8% and operating margin was 26.8%. 
So moving to Slide 6. Welding demand continued to be very strong with organic revenue growth of 22%. Equipment revenue was up 25% and consumables grew 18%. Our industrial businesses increased 32% in the commercial business, which sells to small businesses and individual users grew 18%. North America was up 24% and international growth was 12% with continued recovery in oil and gas, which was up 9%. Welding had an operating margin of 30% in the quarter. 
Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 3%, with demand holding steady at the elevated levels that began in Q3 of last year. And as such, had a tough comp of plus 6% a year ago. 
In Q3, growth was led by the Polymers business, up 8% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with sustained strength in the retail channel. And Fluids was down 5% due mostly to a decline in pandemic-related hygiene products versus prior year. Margins were 24.2% with more than 250 basis points of negative margin impact from price cost driven by significantly higher costs for resins and silicone. 
Moving to Slide 7. And a similar situation with construction, where organic growth was also up 3% and also on top of a strong year-ago growth rate of plus 8%. All 3 regions delivered growth with North America up 2%, with residential renovation up 1%, on top of a plus 14% over a year ago and commercial was up 10%. Europe was up 8% and Australia and New Zealand was up 2%. We Specialty organic revenue was up 8%, driven by continued recovery in North America, which was up 15%, and international was down 4%. Equipment sales were up 10% with consumables up almost 8%. 
Let's move on to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. As you saw in the press release, we're updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $8.30 to $8.50 which incorporates the impact of actual and anticipated lower automotive customer production levels in Q3 and Q4 versus our previous guidance on July 30. We now expect the Automotive OEM segment revenue to be down about 15% in the second half, including being down 20% in Q4 versus the forecast of roughly flat second half auto on revenues that was embedded in our previous guidance. All other segments remain on track or better versus our previous guidance. 
Our $8.40 midpoint equates to earnings growth of 27% for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion, which is up 13% at the midpoint, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Of that organic growth rate of 11% to 12% volume growth, including share gains are 8% with price of 3% to 4%. 
For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 24%, which is up 100 basis points versus last year. And the fact that we're expanding margins at all in this environment is pretty strong performance, considering that we now expect raw material costs to be up 9% or more than $400 million year-over-year, which is more than 4x our expectation coming into this year. Our businesses are on track to offset raw material cost increases with pricing actions on a dollar-per-dollar basis, which, as you know, is EPS neutral but margin dilutive. As raw material costs and consequently, price have gone up more than what we predicted in our previous guidance, we now estimate margin dilution percentage impact from price cost for the full year at about 150 basis points versus our previous expectation of 100 basis points. These margin headwinds though, will be offset by strong volume leverage of about 250 basis points and another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives of more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of net income as we continue to prioritize sustaining our world-class service levels for our customers in this challenging environment, and as such, we will continue to invest in additional working capital to support our growth and mitigate supply chain risks. Our updated guidance is based on an expected tax rate for Q4 of 23% to 24% for a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. 
And as per user process, our guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test and Simulation business. We are awaiting one final regulatory approval and expect to receive that and close the transaction in Q4. 
So in summary, this will be a record year for ITW with double-digit organic growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow and EPS growth of 25% plus. We expect this strong demand momentum to continue in Q4 and well into next year with an additional boost from automotive OEM likely at some point in 2022 as the supply chain issues there begin to improve. ITW remains very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. 
With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you."

Obviously, offset with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, like are in line with our policy here but still margin dilutive pretty significantly at over 300 basis points here in the third quarter. 
I think once the timing in terms of when is that going to be -- when is that impact going to start to diminish is difficult to say. What we can say with a high degree of confidence is and also at this point to our track record, our ability to read and react to whatever cost increases come our way and respond appropriately and decisively with price. I think kind of that track record speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do that. And we're certainly hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we're not counting on that as we look forward. And so you'll probably see a little bit of margin pressure in construction again here in Q4 relative to Q3. Q4 has some -- we've got a couple of less shipping days, seasonality, typically, we go down in Q4 relative to Q3. But I'd say in terms of the long term, structurally, construction margins are going to be back in the high 20s at some point here once these near-term issues don't get resolved."

And then would you say that Q4 maybe is the peak negative margin impact from materials and resins and that kind of stuff."

Yes, look, what I can say just on the materials, I think the rate of increase -- from Q2 to Q3, we saw a big step-up in our raw material cost inflation. I think it's unlikely we'll see the same thing here in Q4. I mean, we're already through October. But beyond that, who knows, I think, like I said, it's a typical seasonality for us. We go down from Q3 to Q4, revenues are down. Margins are down. We've got 2 less shipping days. Automotive OEM, we said down 20% year-over-year. The other 6 segments will all have positive organic growth. Margin performance in those segments will be similar to Q3, if not a little bit better. And then you just need to adjust for the tax rate, the discrete item, we gave you the detail on that in Q3 versus Q4. And then there is a little bit of currency headwind, which is really more of a rounding, but we have a little bit more currency headwind in Q4 than Q3. So -- you put all of that together, you get to what hopefully is a risk-adjusted pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter, and we'll see where we go from here. So..."

And then on the foodservice equipment side, particularly on institutional, is there any risk that there's some pull forward of demand, a lot of institutions curtailed by the federal government with COVID aid.

So I'd point to those 3 as the strongest. In terms of the institutional side, we really don't think that there's a significant impact there. I mean from pull forward, overall, in the institutional side was up, like we said, Education was up 40%, but health so was health care. Health care was up 20%.

I would say it's certainly -- it remains the segment with the biggest lag in terms of our ability to recover, but ultimately, those -- we're going to -- our approach there is the same as it is in the rest of the company is that we're going to expect to get full recovery on the dollar amount of inflation that we're seeing. 
And I'd say the margin issue there is sort of the price cost is somewhat of an issue in the short run, but it's much more value. There's a lot of volume levers there. And as we start -- shipments start improving, volumes start to recover given some of the supply chain snacks get resolved, then we'll have -- there's nothing that I see that won't get us back to sort of prior peak in terms of auto margins and have them go up from there as we grow that business."

In the third quarter, we saw continued strong growth momentum in 6 of our 7 segments and delivered excellent operational execution and financial results. Revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 6% and earnings per share of $2.02 was up 10%.  
At the segment level, organic growth was led by welding at plus 22%; food equipment at plus 19%; Test & Measurement and Electronics at plus 12% and specialty products at plus 8%. Our automotive OE segment continued to be impacted in the near term by auto production cutbacks associated with the well-publicized supply chain challenges affecting our auto customers.  
In Q3, auto production cutbacks ended up being significantly larger than what was projected heading into the quarter. And as a result, our auto OEM segment revenues were down 11% in Q3 versus the minus 2% we were expecting as of the end of June.  
In a very challenging environment, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of executing for our customers and for the company.  
In Q3, our people leveraged the combination of ITW's robust and highly flexible 80/20 front-to-back operating system. The company is close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain capabilities and systems and our decision to stay fully staffed and invested through the pandemic to sustain world-class service levels for our customers.  
They also executed appropriate and timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs. And as a result, we were able to fully offset input cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in Q3, resulting in 0 EPS impact from price cost in the quarter.  
And, by the way, our teams also managed to continue to drive progress on our long-term strategy, execute on our Win the Recovery positioning initiative and deliver another 100 basis points of margin improvement benefit from enterprise initiatives.  
Moving forward, we remain very focused on sustaining our growth momentum and on fully leveraging the competitive strength of the ITW business model and the investments we have made and continue to make in support of the execution of our enterprise strategy.  
Before turning it over to Michael, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for all their efforts and for their dedication to keeping themselves and their ITW colleagues safe to serving our customers with excellence and to driving continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential.

Thanks to a great effort by our businesses, price cost was EPS-neutral in Q3 but still dilutive to operating margin percentage by 200 basis points as raw material cost increases further escalated in the third quarter.  
Throughout 2021, our businesses have quickly and decisively responded to raw material and logistics cost inflation with pricing actions in alignment with our policy to fully offset these cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we've talked about this before, but given the current environment, I'll remind you that we don't hedge. So current cost inflation is always moving through our businesses in real time.  
After-tax return on invested capital was 28.5% and free cash flow was $548 million. Free cash flow conversion was 86% as our businesses have been very intentional about adding inventory to both support our growth and to mitigate supply chain risk and sustained world-class service levels for our customers.  
Overall, for the quarter, then strong growth in 6 of 7 segments and excellent operational and financial execution across the board.  
Let's go to Slide 4 for segment results. And before we get to the segment detail, the data on the left side of the slide illustrates our strong Q3 results with and without automotive OEM. I wanted to highlight 2 key points. The first is the benefit we derive from our high-quality diversified business portfolio in terms of the strength, resilience and consistency of ITW's financial performance. which is enabling us, in this case, to power through significant near-term headwinds in our largest segment and still deliver top-tier overall performance.  
The second is the accelerating growth momentum with strong core earnings leverage we're generating across the company. Excluding our auto OEM segment, given the issues affecting that market right now, the rest of the company collectively delivered organic growth of 11%. Operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 25% plus in Q3. As you can see on this slide, if you eliminate the price/cost impact, our core incrementals were a very strong 52% in the third quarter, which points to the quality of growth and profitability leverage that define the core focus of our business model and strategy.  
Now let's take a closer look at our segment performance in Q3, beginning with automotive OEM on the right side of this page. Organic revenue was down 11%, with North America down 12%, Europe, down 18%; and China, up 2%.  
And as Scott mentioned, supply chain-related production cutbacks were much larger in Q3 than what we and most, if not all, external auto industry forecasters were expecting heading into the quarter.  
While conditions in the auto market are obviously very challenging in the near term, but really good news from our standpoint is that the eventual and inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major source of growth for ITW over an extended period of time once the current supply chain issues begin to improve and ultimately get resolved.  
Between now and whenever that is, we will remain fully invested and strongly positioned to support our customers and seize incremental share gain opportunities as production accelerates coming out the other side of this situation.  
Turning to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, and organic revenue growth was very strong at 19% and the Food Equipment recovery that began in Q2 continues to gain strength. North America was up 18% with equipment up 20% and service up 14%. Institutional revenue, which is about 1/3 of our revenue, increased more than 20%, with strength in education, up over 40% and health care and lodging growth of around 20%. Restaurants were up almost 50% with strength across the board. Strong demand is evident internationally as well with Europe up 20% and Asia Pacific, up 23%. Equipment sales led the way up 26% with service growth of 8%. In our view, this segment is in the early stages of recovery as evidenced by revenues that are still below pre-COVID levels.  
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was strong with growth of 12%. Test & Measurement was up 15%, driven by continued strength in customer CapEx spend and in our businesses that serve the semiconductor space. Electronics grew 8% and operating margin was 26.8%.  
So moving to Slide 6. Welding demand continued to be very strong with organic revenue growth of 22%. Equipment revenue was up 25% and consumables grew 18%. Our industrial businesses increased 32% in the commercial business, which sells to small businesses and individual users grew 18%. North America was up 24% and international growth was 12% with continued recovery in oil and gas, which was up 9%. Welding had an operating margin of 30% in the quarter.  
Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 3%, with demand holding steady at the elevated levels that began in Q3 of last year. And as such, had a tough comp of plus 6% a year ago.  
In Q3, growth was led by the Polymers business, up 8% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with sustained strength in the retail channel. And Fluids was down 5% due mostly to a decline in pandemic-related hygiene products versus prior year. Margins were 24.2% with more than 250 basis points of negative margin impact from price cost driven by significantly higher costs for resins and silicone.  
Moving to Slide 7. And a similar situation with construction, where organic growth was also up 3% and also on top of a strong year-ago growth rate of plus 8%. All 3 regions delivered growth with North America up 2%, with residential renovation up 1%, on top of a plus 14% comp a year ago and commercial was up 10%. Europe was up 8% and Australia and New Zealand was up 2%. Specialty organic revenue was up 8%, driven by continued recovery in North America, which was up 15%, and international was down 4%. Equipment sales were up 10% with consumables up almost 8%.  
Let's move on to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. As you saw in the press release, we're updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $8.30 to $8.50 which incorporates the impact of actual and anticipated lower automotive customer production levels in Q3 and Q4 versus our previous guidance on July 30. We now expect the Automotive OEM segment revenue to be down about 15% in the second half, including being down 20% in Q4 versus the forecast of roughly flat second half auto OEM revenues that was embedded in our previous guidance. All other segments remain on track or better versus our previous guidance.  
Our $8.40 midpoint equates to earnings growth of 27% for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion, which is up 13% at the midpoint, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Of that organic growth rate of 11% to 12% volume growth, including share gains are 8% with price of 3% to 4%.  
For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 24%, which is up 100 basis points versus last year. And the fact that we're expanding margins at all in this environment is pretty strong performance, considering that we now expect raw material costs to be up 9% or more than $400 million year-over-year, which is more than 4x our expectation coming into this year. Our businesses are on track to offset raw material cost increases with pricing actions on a dollar-per-dollar basis, which, as you know, is EPS neutral but margin dilutive. As raw material costs and consequently, price have gone up more than what we predicted in our previous guidance, we now estimate margin dilution percentage impact from price cost for the full year at about 150 basis points versus our previous expectation of 100 basis points. 
These margin headwinds though, will be offset by strong volume leverage of about 250 basis points and another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives of more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of net income as we continue to prioritize sustaining our world-class service levels for our customers in this challenging environment, and as such, we will continue to invest in additional working capital to support our growth and mitigate supply chain risks. 
Our updated guidance is based on an expected tax rate for Q4 of 23% to 24% for a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%.  
And as per usual process, our guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test and Simulation business. We are awaiting one final regulatory approval and expect to receive that and close the transaction in Q4.  
So in summary, this will be a record year for ITW with double-digit organic growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow and EPS growth of 25% plus. We expect this strong demand momentum to continue in Q4 and well into next year with an additional boost from automotive OEM likely at some point in 2022 as the supply chain issues there begin to improve. ITW remains very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment.  
With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you."

I mean I think in terms of construction as we look at kind of the margins on a year-over-year basis, good enterprise initiative contributions, good volume leverage.

Obviously, offset with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, like are in line with our policy here but still margin dilutive pretty significantly at over 300 basis points here in the third quarter.  
I think once the timing in terms of when is that going to be -- when is that impact going to start to diminish is difficult to say. What we can say with a high degree of confidence is and also at this point to our track record, our ability to read and react to whatever cost increases come our way and respond appropriately and decisively with price. I think kind of that track record speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do that. 
And we're certainly hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we're not counting on that as we look forward. And so you'll probably see a little bit of margin pressure in construction again here in Q4 relative to Q3. Q4 has some -- we've got a couple of less shipping days, seasonality, typically, we go down in Q4 relative to Q3. But I'd say in terms of the long term, structurally, construction margins are going to be back in the high 20s at some point here once these near-term issues get resolved."

Perhaps just digging a little bit more. I know you've talked a lot about the momentum going into 2022, but you said in your nice brief opening comments, that other than automotive, some of your other businesses were actually doing better than you had expected. If you could just expand on that a little bit.  
And then on the food service equipment side, particularly on institutional, is there any risk that there's some pull forward of demand, a lot of institutions curtailed by the federal government with COVID aid. I mean, are you hearing anything about that driving demand on the institutional side. So broadly, first and then maybe a little bit more on the drivers of demand in Food Equipment."

If you take those out, the momentum is really strong as well in the test and measurement business on the back of strong demand on the semiconductor side.  
So I'd point to those 3 as the strongest. In terms of the institutional side, we really don't think that there's a significant impact there. I mean from pull forward, overall, in the institutional side was up, like we said 20%, education was up 40%, but health so was health care. Health care was up 20%. So we don't really think that there's a significant impact. And we certainly haven't seen anything slowing down on the institutional side or really any of the other kind of end markets within Food Equipment."

What I would say in regards to this current situation is the delta of inflation, raw material cost is certainly one where we're having discussions about with our customers about needing to adjust that. And we're not clearly the only ones in that respect with our auto customers. 
So we're working through that. I would say it's certainly -- it remains the segment with the biggest lag in terms of our ability to recover, but ultimately, those -- we're going to -- our approach there is the same as it is in the rest of the company is that we're going to expect to get full recovery on the dollar amount of inflation that we're seeing.  
And I'd say the margin issue there is sort of the price cost is somewhat of an issue in the short run, but it's much more value. There's a lot of volume leverage there. And as we start -- shipments start improving, volumes start to recover given some of the supply chain snacks get resolved, then we'll have -- there's nothing that I see that won't get us back to sort of prior peak in terms of auto margins and have them go up from there as we grow that business."
