For the full year 2020, MPS achieved record revenue, $844.5   million   growing 34.5% from the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tier companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. As we see more high-quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to successfully invest in our infrastructure and capabilities that support that growth. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2020, brought online a new 12-inch fab 1 year ahead of schedule, allowing for qualified parts to be shipped in Q4 of this year. We will continue to invest in the capacity and diversity of our supply chain with plans to bring up a new 8-inch fab in 2021. The began volume shipments of 48-volt QSMOD technology for AI applications, proving the commercial viability of our leading-edge system solutions in this critically important market. Designed and integrated power management solution for autonomous driving vehicles. Shipments began to ramp in Q3 of 2020. 
Launched our ESG website, aggregating all of our environmental, social and governance values, policies and practices into one easily accessed location. Customers, employees, shareholders are now able to fully appreciate MPS' commitment to sustainability, transparency of our business practices and our ongoing social responsibility. While 2020 was very successful in terms of our financial performance, product development and new customer acquisition, supply chain capacity constraints for mader limited our ability to fulfill all of our customers' demand. This is a result of demand increases during the year and industry-wide capacity constraints. We can take some solace and having recognized this issue in 2019, which propelled us to bring up our second 12-inch fab, maintaining our ability to meet strong demand while delivering high-quality products to our customers as represented an extraordinary challenge that continues into 2021. 
Despite these challenges, we will continue to execute on our strategic plan. Turning back to full year 2020 revenue by market segment compared with 2019, communications revenue up 67.9% and consumer revenue up 34.2%. Computing and storage, up 33.8%; automotive, up 20.7% and industrial, up 20.3% and demonstrating just how broad-based our revenue improvement was. 
Communications revenue grew $57.5 million to $142.3 million. This improvement was primarily due to an infrastructure sales ramp. Communications revenue represented 16.9% of our 2020 revenue compared with 13.5% in 2019. Consumer revenue grew $56.2 million to $220.4 million, reversing 2 consecutive years of sales declines. This growth reflected higher game console sales, along with increased sales of wearables and home appliances. Consumer revenue represented 26.1% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared with 26.2% in 2019. 
Full year 2020 computing and storage revenue grew $64.0 million over the prior year to $253.2 million. This 33.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for cloud computing and storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.0% of MPS' total revenue in 2020 compared with 30.1% in 2019. Automotive revenue grew $18.7 million to $109 million in 2020. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. 
Automotive revenue represented 12.9% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared with 14.4% in 2019. Industrial revenue grew $20.2 million to $119.6 million in 2020. This growth primarily reflected higher sales for applications in power sources. Industrial revenue represented 14.2% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared to 15.8% in 2019. 
Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $233.0 million, 10.2% lower than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2020, but  39.8% higher than the comparable quarter of 2019. By market segment, revenue for consumer grew 69.7% year-over-year automotive grew 63.1%. Industrial grew 38.8%. Communications grew 35.6%, and computing and storage grew 11.1%. 
Fourth quarter 2020 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, 20 basis points higher than both third quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $40.0 million compared to $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020 and $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter 2020 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, 20 basis points higher than both the third quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our non-GAAP operating income was $66.3 million compared to $84.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $88.9 million in the fourth quarter compared with $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2020 operating expenses were $63.6 million up from the $59.1 million we spent in the third quarter of 2020 and up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. On both a GAAP on a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses were $1.5 million compared with a $1.8 million expense in Q3 2020 and a $991,000 expense in Q4 2019. 
The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2020 stock compensation expense, including $686,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million compared with $23.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $42.9 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share compared with $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020 and $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Q4 2020 non-GAAP net income was $62.5 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share compared with $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020 and $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2020 were $47.6 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020 cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $598.0 million compared with $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $79.6 million compared with Q3 2020 operating cash flow of $77.4 million. Fourth quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $11.5 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $66.8 million or 26 days of sales outstanding compared with the $93.5 million or 33 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the $52.7 million or 29 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 were $157.1 million, up from $148.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice. And as you can see from the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 137 days at the end of Q4 2020 from the 116 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 132 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 from 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. 
I would like to turn to our Q1 2021 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2021 revenue in the range of $236 million to $248 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $27.0 million to $29.0 million including approximately $800,000 that would be charged to cost of goods hold. 
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $89.0 million and $93.0 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $62.8 to $64.8 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.8 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. 
Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to 48.3 million shares. Finally, we are pleased to announce a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share from $0.50 per share for shareholders of record as of March 31, 2021. 
In conclusion, our performance in 2020 validated our strategy to grow through diversification and sustainability. We will continue to execute this strategy and invest in our future. 
I will now open the phone lines for questions."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. 
In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020, and Form 10-Q filed on November 6, 2020, both of which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. 
We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q4 2019, Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 earnings releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. 
I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen."

For the full year 2020, MPS achieved record revenue, $844.5 million, growing 34.5% from prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first-tier companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. As we see more high-quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to successfully invest in our infrastructure and capabilities that support that growth. Here are a few highlights which we achieved in 2020. 
Brought online a new 12-inch fab 1 year ahead of schedule, allowing for qualified parts to be shipped in Q4 of this year. We will continue to invest in the capacity and diversity of our supply chain with plans to bring up a new 8-inch fab in 2021. 
Began volume shipments of 48-volt QSMod technology for AI applications, proving the commercial viability of our leading-edge system solutions in this critically important market. 
Designed and integrated power management solution for autonomous driving vehicles. Shipments began to ramp in Q3 of 2020. 
Launched our ESG website, aggregating all of our environmental, social and governance values, policies and practices into one easily accessed location. Customers, employees, shareholders are now able to fully appreciate MPS' commitment to sustainability, transparency of our business practices and our ongoing social responsibility. 
While 2020 was very successful in terms of our financial performance, product development and new customer acquisition, supply chain capacity constraints [ from that year ] limited our ability to fulfill all of our customers' demand. This is a result of demand increases during the year and industry-wide capacity constraints. We can take some solace in having recognized this issue in 2019, which propelled us to bring up our second 12-inch fab. Maintaining our ability to meet strong demand while delivering high-quality products to our customers has represented an extraordinary challenge that continues into 2021. Despite these challenges, we will continue to execute on our strategic plan. 
Turning back to full year 2020 revenue by market segment compared with 2019, communications revenue, up 67.9%; and consumer revenue, up 34.2%; computing and storage, up 33.8%; automotive, up 20.7%; and industrial, up 20.3%, demonstrating just how broad-based our revenue improvement was. 
Communications revenue grew $57.5 million to $142.3 million. This improvement was primarily due to an infrastructure sales ramp. Communications revenue represented 16.9% of our 2020 revenue compared with 13.5% in 2019. 
Consumer revenue grew $56.2 million to $220.4 million, reversing 2 consecutive years of sales declines. This growth reflected higher game console sales along with increased sales of wearables and home appliances. Consumer revenue represented 26.1% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared with 26.2% in 2019. 
Full year 2020 computing and storage revenue grew $64.0 million over the prior year to $253.2 million. This 33.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for cloud computing and storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.0% of MPS' total revenue in 2020 compared with 30.1% in 2019. 
Automotive revenue grew $18.7 million to $109.0 million in 2020. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue represented 12.9% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared with 14.4% in 2019. 
Industrial revenue grew $20.2 million to $119.6 million in 2020. This growth primarily reflected higher sales for applications in power sources. Industrial revenue represented 14.2% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared to 15.8% in 2019. 
Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $233.0 million, 10.2% lower than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2020 but  39.8% higher than the comparable quarter of 2019. By market segment, revenue for consumer grew 69.7% year-over-year, automotive grew 63.1%, industrial grew 38.8%, communications grew 35.6%, and computing and storage grew 11.1%. 
Fourth quarter 2020 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, 20 basis points higher than both third quarter 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $40.0 million compared to $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020 and $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter 2020 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, 20 basis points higher than both the third quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP operating income was $66.3 million compared to $84.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter 2019. 
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $88.9 million in the fourth quarter compared with $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2020 operating expenses were $63.6 million, up from the $59.1 million we spent in the third quarter of 2020 and up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses were $1.5 million compared with a $1.8 million expense in Q3 2020 and a $991,000 expense in Q4 2019. 
The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2020 stock compensation expense, including $686,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million compared with $23.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2020. 
Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $42.9 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share compared with $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020 and $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Q4 2020 non-GAAP net income was $62.5 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share compared with $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020 and $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2020 were 47.6 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $598.0 million compared with $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $79.6 million compared with Q3 2020 operating cash flow of $77.4 million. Fourth quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $11.5 million.  
Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $66.8 million or 26 days of sales outstanding compared with the $93.5 million or 33 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the $52.7 million or 29 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 were $157.1 million, up from $148.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020. 
Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice and as you can see from the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 137 days at the end of Q4 2020 from the 116 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 132 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 from 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. 
I would like to turn to our Q1 2021 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2021 revenue in the range of $236 million to $248 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $27.0 million to $29.0 million, including approximately $800,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $89.0 million and $93.0 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $62.8 million to $64.8 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.8 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to 48.3 million shares. Finally, we are pleased to announce a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share from $0.50 per share for shareholders of record as of March 31, 2021. 
In conclusion, our performance in 2020 validated our strategy to grow through diversification and sustainability. We will continue to execute this strategy and invest in our future.

MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million, 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020. And the year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly, broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions.  37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last 3 years. New product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth. 
Looking at our revenue by market. First quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected a broad increase in overall demand, along with the initial ramp revenue ramp from our new mobile device charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with 22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020. 
First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million, grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products and first-time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year. In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2021 revenue of $67.5 million increased $15.5 million or 29.9% year-over-year, due primarily to higher notebook and storage sales. Computing and storage revenue represented 26.5% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 31.3% in the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $39.8 million increased 57.7% from the first quarter of 2020 and accounted for 15.6% of our total first quarter revenue the revenue increase over the first quarter of 2020, primarily reflected broad-based gains in all of our major product groups. First quarter 2021 communications revenue of $36.1 million, rose $8.2 million or 29.4% from the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher networking and wireless gateway home router sales. Communication revenue represented 14.2% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.8% in the first quarter of 2020. Our sustainable above-market growth is based on the following: one, we have and are continuously investing in expansion and diversification of our supply chain, specifically, we executed ahead of market demand; two, we accelerated the release of Advanced Products and solutions based on our leading edge technologies; three, we have gained increased acceptance of our solutions with first tier customers globally; four, we continue to diversify and support a wider number of end product applications. 
Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $46.1 million compared with $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the first quarter of 2021, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%, 10 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 30 basis points better than the first quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP operating income was $75.8 million compared to $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $95.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2021 operating expenses were $66.2 million, up from the $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $816,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $28.6 million compared with $23.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $45.4 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $42.9 million or $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 non-GAAP net income was $69.5 million or $1.46 per fully diluted share compared with $62.5 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2021 were $47.7 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $641.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to $598.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.1 million compared with operating cash flow of $79.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $19 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2021 at $84.1 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up 4 days from 26 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2021 were $175 million, up from the $157.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Days of inventory increased to 141 days at the end of Q1 2021 compared with 137 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter's revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory increased slightly to 128 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 from 126 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. 
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $274 million to $286 million. We also expect to follow GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%. 
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $95.9 million and $99.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $65.5 to $67.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $31.4 to $33.4 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to 48.3 million shares. 
In conclusion, we have paved the way to multibillion dollar revenue. I will now open the webinar for questions."

MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million, 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly, broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions. 37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last 3 years. New product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth. 
Looking at our revenue by market. First quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected a broad increase in overall demand, along with the initial ramp -- revenue ramp from our new mobile device-charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with 22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020. 
First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million, grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products and first-time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year. 
In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2021 revenue of $67.5 million increased $15.5 million or 29.9% year-over-year, due primarily to higher notebook and storage sales. Computing and storage revenue represented 26.5% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 31.3% in the first quarter of 2020. 
First quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $39.8 million increased 57.7% from the first quarter of 2020 and accounted for 15.6% of our total first quarter revenue. The revenue increase over the first quarter of 2020 primarily reflected broad-based gains in all of our major product groups. 
First quarter 2021 communications revenue of $36.1 million, rose $8.2 million or 29.4% from the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher networking and wireless gateway home router sales. Communication revenue represented 14.2% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.8% in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our sustainable above-market growth is based on the following: one, we have and are continuously investing in expansion and diversification of our supply chain, specifically, we executed ahead of market demand; two, we accelerated the release of advanced products and solutions based on our leading-edge technologies; three, we have gained increased acceptance of our solutions with first-tier customers globally; four, we continue to diversify and support a wider number of end product applications. 
Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $46.1 million compared with $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the first quarter of 2021, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%, 10 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 30 basis points better than the first quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP operating income was $75.8 million compared to $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $95.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2021 operating expenses were $66.2 million, up from the $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $816,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $28.6 million compared with $23.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $45.4 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $42.9 million or $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 non-GAAP net income was $69.5 million or $1.46 per fully diluted share compared with $62.5 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2021 were 47.7 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $641.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to $598.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.1 million compared with operating cash flow of $79.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $19 million. 
Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2021 at $84.1 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up 4 days from 26 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2021 were $175 million, up from the $157.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Days of inventory increased to 141 days at the end of Q1 2021 compared with 137 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter's revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory increased slightly to 128 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 from 126 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. 
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $274 million to $286 million. We also expect to follow GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%. 
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $95.9 million and $99.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $65.5 to $67.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $31.4 to $33.4 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to 48.3 million shares. 
In conclusion, we have paved the way to multibillion-dollar revenue. I will now open the webinar for questions."

Recently in this earnings season, a lot of semistocks have sold off on really good numbers, and it clearly looks like the market is worried about double ordering, those sorts of peak cyclical activities. Can you talk a little bit about how your visibility has changed, if at all, over the last quarter from the demand side of the equation?

So go back to your question, what's the demand, okay? We believe a lot of our demand is sustainable. The reason we said that -- Bernie said earlier in a script, and that for us, these are greenfield market, greenfield product line, we started to grow. And as Bernie said, 37% of our products, we grow all from new products we -- that we released from the last 3 years.

MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad-based year-over-year revenue growth was the result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment in production capacity. 
Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market. Computing and storage revenue of $87.7 million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products. Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue was up 173.9% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Second quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented 14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter of 2021.  Most of the sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and wireless applications. Communications sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our sustainable above-market growth is based on the following: We have and are continuously investing in the expansion and diversification of our supply chain; we accelerated the release of advanced products and solutions based on our new technologies; three, we have gained increased acceptance of our solutions with first tier customers globally; and four, we continue to diversify and support a wider number of end product applications. With our planned capacity expansion in place and as we release more parts into production, we are well positioned to accelerate our future revenue growth. 
Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.0%, 60 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 90 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $60.6 million compared to $46.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2021 and $28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.3%, up 50 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2021, and 60 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue reflected lower proportional overhead costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was $94.9 million compared to $75.8 million reported in the prior quarter, and $53.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020, representing a 79% year-over-year increase in operating income.
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared with $95.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2021 operating expenses were $70.3 million, up from the $66.2 million we spent in the first quarter of 2021, and up from the $50.7 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $885,000 charged to cost of goods sold, was $32.1 million compared with $28.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021. 
Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $55.2 million or $1.16 per fully diluted share compared with $45.4 million or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2021 and $30.2 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $86.5 million or $1.81 per fully diluted share compared with $69.5 million or $1.46 per share in the first quarter of 2021, and $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2021 were 47.8 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021 compared to $641.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $96.9 million compared with Q1 2021 operating cash flow of $77.1 million. Second quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $39.3 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2021 at $77.6 million, representing 24 days of sales outstanding, which was 6 days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and 3 days lower than the 27 days reported in the second quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2021 were $177.3 million, up from $175.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Days of inventory of 125 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 or 16 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2021. 
Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with following quarters revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 or 7 days lower than the 124 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and 2 days lower than the 119 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020. 
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $309 million to $321 million. Gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to include a onetime benefit from a $4 million litigation settler. Including this benefit, GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 57.3% to 57.9% and non-GAAP gross margin will be in a range of 57.6% to 58.2%. Excluding this onetime event, non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense should be in the range of $31.2 million to $33.2 million, including approximately $950,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $104.1 million and $108.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will be in the range of $73.9 million to $75.9 million. Litigation expense should range between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.4 million to 48.4 million shares. 
In conclusion,  with our planned capacity expansion in place and as we release more parts into production, we are well positioned to accelerate our future revenue growth. I'll now open up the webinar for questions."

MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020.

MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad-based year-over-year revenue growth was the result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment in production capacity. 
Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market. Computing and storage revenue of $87.7 million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products. Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue was up 173.9% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Second quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented 14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter of 2021.  Most of the sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and wireless applications. Communications sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our sustainable above-market growth is based on the following: We have and are continuously investing in the expansion and diversification of our supply chain; we accelerated the release of advanced products and solutions based on our new technologies; three, we have gained increased acceptance of our solutions with first tier customers globally; and four, we continue to diversify and support a wider number of end product applications. With our planned capacity expansion in place and as we release more parts into production, we are well positioned to accelerate our future revenue growth. 
Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.0%, 60 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 90 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $60.6 million compared to $46.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2021 and $28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.3%, up 50 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2021, and 60 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue reflected lower proportional overhead costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was $94.9 million compared to $75.8 million reported in the prior quarter and $53.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020, representing a 79% year-over-year increase in operating income.
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared with $95.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2021 operating expenses were $70.3 million, up from the $66.2 million we spent in the first quarter of 2021, and up from the $50.7 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. 
For the second quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $885,000 charged to cost of goods sold, was $32.1 million compared with $28.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021. 
Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $55.2 million or $1.16 per fully diluted share compared with $45.4 million or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2021 and $30.2 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Q2 non-GAAP net income was $86.5 million or $1.81 per fully diluted share compared with $69.5 million or $1.46 per share in the first quarter of 2021 and $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2021 were 47.8 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021 compared to $641.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $96.9 million compared with Q1 2021 operating cash flow of $77.1 million. Second quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $39.3 million. 
Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2021 at $77.6 million, representing 24 days of sales outstanding, which was 6 days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and 3 days lower than the 27 days reported in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2021 were $177.3 million, up from $175.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Days of inventory of 125 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 or 16 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2021. 
Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with following quarters revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 or 7 days lower than the 124 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and 2 days lower than the 119 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020. 
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $309 million to $321 million. Gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to include a onetime benefit from a $4 million litigation settler. Including this benefit, GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 57.3% to 57.9% and non-GAAP gross margin will be in a range of 57.6% to 58.2%. Excluding this onetime event, non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%. 
Total stock-based compensation expense should be in the range of $31.2 million to $33.2 million, including approximately $950,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $104.1 million and $108.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will be in the range of $73.9 million to $75.9 million. Litigation expense should range between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.4 million to 48.4 million shares. 
In conclusion, with our planned capacity expansion in place and as we release more parts into production, we are well positioned to accelerate our future revenue growth. I'll now open up the webinar for questions."

What I would comment on is that we believe that we are optimizing across all of our different end markets. And again, it's really the strength of the model is in the diversification. And whereas a lot of the traditional seasonality would have been tied to consumer, for example. Now we have a much higher percentage our business that is tied to computing, automotive and industrial, and they don't necessarily recognize the same level of seasonality. 
But then to sort of complete the question, I think if you look at the near-term growth, obviously, the current year has benefited significantly from automotive and compute storage, in particular. And we believe that going forward, automotive along with communications should be our longer-term drivers."

MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $52.2 million increased 20.5% from the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to increased revenue for industrial meters and power sources. 
Industrial revenue represented 16.1% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 communications revenue of $44.7 million was up 19.3% from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased infrastructure demand. Communication sales represented 13.8% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. 
In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $98.6 million increased $10.9 million or 12.4% from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue growth primarily reflected sales gains in storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.5% of MPS' third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $54.4 million grew $5.7 million or 11.7% over the second quarter of 2021. This improvement reflects continued gains in applications for infotainment, lighting and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 16.8% of MPS' total third quarter 2021 revenue. 
In our consumer markets, third quarter 2021 revenue of $73.6 million fell 3.3% from revenue reported in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease in consumer revenue reflected lower handset sales. Consumer revenue represented 22.8% of our third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%, which was 160 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021 and 245 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 57.8%, 148 basis points higher than the gross margin percentage reported from the second quarter of 2021 and 231 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. 
Third quarter 2021 gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis included a $4 million litigation settlement. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 56.6%, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2021 and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $77.1 million compared to $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021 and $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating income was $108.4 million compared to $94.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $84.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2020.  
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2021 operating expenses were $78.7 million, up from the $70.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2021 and up from the $59.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. 
The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected in increased spending in R&D for qualifying parts for production and securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. 
For the third quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $922,000 charged cost of goods sold was $31.6 million, compared with $32.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Third quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $68.8 million or $1.44 per fully diluted share compared with $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $55.6 million or $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
Q3 non-GAAP net income was $98.6 million or $2.06 per fully diluted share compared with $86.5 million or $1.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $79.4 million or $1.69 and per share in the third quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2021 were $47.9 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $117.8 million, compared with Q2 2021 operating cash flow of $96.9 million. Third quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $18.6 million. 
Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2021 at $79.9 million, representing 22 days of sales outstanding which was 2 days lower than the 24 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 11 days lower than the 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were $208.1 million, up $30.8 million from the $177.3 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021. 
Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 134 days, which were 9 days higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. 
On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 135 days, 18 days higher than the 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 6 days higher than the 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Currently, our inventory levels remain lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 to 200-day level necessary to support our future growth. 
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $314 million to $326 million. We also expect following GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.0% to 56.6%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%. Total stock-based compensation, expense of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, including approximately $950,000 that we'd be charged to cost of goods sold. 
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $107.8 million and $111.8 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $77.9 million to $79.9 million. Litigation expense is expected to be in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute our strategy. 
I will now open the webinar up for questions."

But I think we have been clear that in each of the last 2 years that the growth in notebooks has outpaced the rest of the sectors, including server and storage. 
Now having said that, one of the things that we're benefiting from is that diversification of how we're positioned in this group. As Michael indicated, we are a relatively small player when it comes to core power management for servers and we believe that with both the next generation of Intel and AMD processor releases that we stand to benefit from market share gains. 
And in the more near-term element, as we called out in Q3, we're actually seeing a nice increase in storage sales, which is usually a precursor to ongoing infrastructure spending within the data centers. So I think that we're having as great difficulty as anybody in understanding when work from home or work from work as it relates to notebooks begins or ends.

MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue",1129,"Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $52.2 million increased 20.5% from the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to increased revenue for industrial meters and power sources. 
Industrial revenue represented 16.1% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 communications revenue of $44.7 million was up 19.3% from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased infrastructure demand. Communication sales represented 13.8% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. 
In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $98.6 million increased $10.9 million or 12.4% from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue growth primarily reflected sales gains in storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.5% of MPS' third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $54.4 million grew $5.7 million or 11.7% over the second quarter of 2021. This improvement reflects continued gains in applications for infotainment, lighting and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 16.8% of MPS' total third quarter 2021 revenue. 
In our consumer markets, third quarter 2021 revenue of $73.6 million fell 3.3% from revenue reported in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease in consumer revenue reflected lower handset sales. Consumer revenue represented 22.8% of our third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%, which was 160 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021 and 245 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 57.8%, 148 basis points higher than the gross margin percentage reported from the second quarter of 2021 and 231 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. 
Third quarter 2021 gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis included a $4 million litigation settlement. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 56.6%, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2021 and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $77.1 million compared to $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021 and $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating income was $108.4 million compared to $94.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $84.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2020.  
Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2021 operating expenses were $78.7 million, up from the $70.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2021 and up from the $59.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. 
The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected in increased spending in R&D for qualifying parts for production and securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. 
For the third quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $922,000 charged cost of goods sold was $31.6 million, compared with $32.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2021. 
Switching to the bottom line. Third quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $68.8 million or $1.44 per fully diluted share compared with $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $55.6 million or $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
Q3 non-GAAP net income was $98.6 million or $2.06 per fully diluted share compared with $86.5 million or $1.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $79.4 million or $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2021 were 47.9 million. 
Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $117.8 million, compared with Q2 2021 operating cash flow of $96.9 million. Third quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $18.6 million. 
Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2021 at $79.9 million, representing 22 days of sales outstanding which was 2 days lower than the 24 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 11 days lower than the 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were $208.1 million, up $30.8 million from the $177.3 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021. 
Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 134 days, which were 9 days higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. 
On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 135 days, 18 days higher than the 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 6 days higher than the 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Currently, our inventory levels remain lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 to 200-day level necessary to support our future growth. 
I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $314 million to $326 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.0% to 56.6%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, including approximately $950,000 that we'd be charged to cost of goods sold. 
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $107.8 million and $111.8 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $77.9 million to $79.9 million. Litigation expense is expected to be in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute our strategy. 
I will now open the webinar up for questions."

But at the same times, we do have to buy more equipment for testing, for qualifications. And also, we need to hire more people. 
And as you know, they're qualified. Each part, it takes time. And the revenues there, opportunities there, it's just a matter of time. 
And so the second part is buying more equipment. On the other hand, as an investor, our shareholders, investors are very critical about our -- criticized in the past our spending, okay?

But I think we have been clear that in each of the last 2 years, that the growth in notebooks has outpaced the rest of the sectors, including server and storage. 
Now having said that, one of the things that we're benefiting from is that diversification of how we're positioned in this group. As Michael indicated, we are a relatively small player when it comes to core power management for servers and we believe that with both the next generation of Intel and AMD processor releases, that we stand to benefit from market share gains. 
And in the more near-term element, as we called out in Q3, we're actually seeing a nice increase in storage sales, which is usually a precursor to ongoing infrastructure spending within the data centers. So I think that we're having a great difficulty, as anybody, in understanding when work from home or work from work, as it relates to notebooks, begins or ends. But I think that we're well positioned because of our diversification to enjoy continued growth in this category for a number of years."
