Joining me for the call today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer. Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. This morning, Key reported record revenue and earnings. But before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to share a couple of broader and contextual comments. I am very proud of the way our team continues to navigate the pandemic and related economic downturn. Their dedication, combined with our investments in talent and digital capabilities continue to serve the company, our clients, our communities and our shareholders well. Throughout 2020, and we successfully executed what I call our dual mandate. By that, I mean, responding to the pandemic, which is a real humanitarian and economic crisis, while continuing to position Key for both growth and success. 
We have taken countless steps to ensure that our teammates and our clients are both safe and well served. Additionally, we provided billions of dollars in credit to our clients. In 2020, we originated more than 43,000 loans amounting to $8 billion through the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. In fact, we are currently assisting our clients through the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program as we speak. As part of our National Community Benefits plan, we provided billions of dollars in support to our communities. This included affordable housing, home lending and small business lending in low and moderate-income communities, transformative philanthropy and renewable energy financing. Our commitment also includes programs to advance social justice and economic inclusion across all the communities we serve. 
And finally, I want to thank our teammates for rising to every challenge in 2020 in a way that kept our clients at the center of everything we do. I am now turning to Slide 3. Getting back to our performance in the fourth quarter, we achieved a record level of revenue for both the quarter and the year. The growth in net interest income and fee income. Net interest income was up almost 4% from the prior quarter with an 8 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Fee income, also a record, up double digits for both the prior quarter and the year ago period. We continue to benefit from investments that we have made across our company, which drove both income and balance sheet growth. 
Let me touch on 3 specific areas: first, consumer mortgage. We achieved record volume in the fourth quarter with $2.5 billion in funded loans. For the full year, our consumer mortgage originations were $8.3 billion, up 90% from the prior year. This drove both balance sheet growth as well as a 179% increase in fee income. Approximately one-half of our originations last year were purchased mortgages. Our pipelines remain strong, and we expect to continue to both grow and take share. 
The second area I will highlight is investment banking. This is an area where we have invested in talent and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including areas such as health care and technology. In the fourth quarter, we generated $243 million in fees, which represents a record quarter. We enjoyed broad-based growth across the platform, with particular strength in M&A and loan syndications. 2020 was a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees. 
Our investment banking pipelines remain strong, we believe this business will continue to be a growth engine for us in the future. The third area is Laurel Road, and more broadly, the investments we have made in digital across our company. Laurel Road continues to originate high-quality loans that provide us with an opportunity to build broader digital relationships with health care professionals. Last year, Laurel Road originated over $2.3 billion in loans. At the end of March, we will launch our digital bank serving the health care segment, expanding our consumer franchise nationally. This launch will broaden our offering for Laurel Road clients to include deposits, additional lending products and other value-added services. We believe that both Laurel Road and consumer mortgage will continue to be relationship-based growth engines for our consumer business. 
Our expenses this quarter were elevated. They were elevated due to higher production-related incentives, severance and the funding of our philanthropic foundation. Additionally, COVID related expenses and costs associated with our prepaid card also remained elevated again this quarter. Don will cover the outlook in his remarks, but we expect expenses to come down in 2021, while concurrently investing in talent and digital capabilities. 
This year, we will also be accelerating the pace of branch closures. We expect to consolidate over 70 branches, representing 7% of our network, most of these closures taking place in the first half of the year. Our decisions are driven by client behavior as more activity continues to move toward digital channels. It's also informed by our robust analytics. We expect limited client attrition as a high percentage of the impacted branches are located within 2 miles of another key facility. 
Importantly, we expect to continue to grow our retail business, while reducing operating expenses and improving overall profitability. Credit quality remained strong this quarter, with net charge-offs of 53 basis points, within our targeted over the cycle range. Additionally, nonperforming loans declined by almost $50 million this quarter. We will continue to support our clients, while maintaining our moderate risk profile and concurrently positioning the company to perform well through the business cycle. 
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. The results of our recent stress tests, a firm that Key is a different company today, with loss rates and loss-absorbing capital among the best in our peer group. Our strategic positioning allows us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, supporting organic growth, paying dividends and, of course, share repurchases. 
Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $900 million over the next 3 quarters. We also approved our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.185 a share. In closing, despite the challenging environment of the last year, we were able to support our clients, invest in and grow our businesses, while maintaining our strong risk practices. Our success was driven by our dedicated team, the strength of our business model and our relentless focus on executing our strategy. I am confident in Key's future. We are positioned to succeed and continue to deliver on all of our commitments. 
I will now turn it over to Don, who will provide details on our quarter in addition to our outlook for the coming year. Don?"

As Chris said, it was a very strong quarter for us, with record net income from continuing operations of $0.56 per common share, up 37% from prior quarter and 24% from the prior year ago period. Return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was over 16%, up over 400 basis points from the third quarter. I will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 6. Total average loans were $102 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflect an increase of over $7.5 billion from the PPP loans. Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road, and as Chris mentioned, strong performance from our consumer mortgage business. Laurel Road originated $590 million of loans this quarter and $2.3 billion for the full year, up over 20% from the full year 2019. We also generated another record $2.5 billion of consumer mortgage loans in the quarter, bringing the total for the year to $8.3 billion. The investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly, add high-quality loans to our portfolio. 
Linked quarter average loan balances were down 3%, reflecting paydowns from the heightened commercial loan draws as well as a small reduction in PPP balances related to initial forgiveness. Line utilization rates are at the pre pandemic levels given the strong liquidity levels in the environment. Importantly, we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well through the business cycle, and we manage our credit quality with this longer-term perspective. 
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $136 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, up $23 billion or 21% compared to the year ago period and up 0.6% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter increase reflected broad-based commercial growth as well as growth from our -- from higher consumer balances. The growth was offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 11 basis points from the third quarter of 2020, exceeding our guidance of a 6 to 9 basis point decline. Continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of the total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.043 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $987 million a year ago and just over $1 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.7% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.98% for the same period last year and 2.62% from the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income, but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $37 million, and the margin improved by 8 basis points. The increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin quarter-over-quarter are largely due to the lower interest-bearing deposit cost in the higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness. 
We saw the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined 11 basis points from the prior quarter. The forgiveness of the PPP loans accelerated about $28 million of additional fee recognition this quarter. These were partially offset by continued elevated liquidity levels, which had a 5 basis point negative impact on the margin. 
Moving to Slide 9. Our fee-based businesses hit all-time highs in the fourth quarter. Noninterest income was $802 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $651 million for the year ago period and $681 million for the third quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased $151 million. The primary driver was a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $243 million, up $62 million from the year ago period. Stronger M&A and loan syndication fees drove most of the increase this quarter. This business also had a record year with $661 million of total fees. Record mortgage originations drove consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $22 million from the fourth quarter of '19. Cards and payments income also increased $30 million related to higher prepaid card activity from the state government support programs. Compared to the third quarter, noninterest income increased by $121 million. The largest driver of the quarterly increase was once again the record quarter for investment banking, which was up $97 million. 
Commercial mortgage servicing fees also had a strong quarter, up $14 million. I'm now turning to Slide 11 -- excuse me, Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.128 billion compared to $980 million last year and $1.037 billion in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel costs driven by higher production-related incentives from our record fee production as well as higher severance costs. Year-over-year, payments related costs reported and other expense were $40 million higher, driven by higher prepaid activity, and we incurred COVID-19 related expenses to ensure the health and safety of our teammates. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $91 million. The increase was largely due to $40 million of higher production-related incentives, $22 million of severance. $12 million of higher stock-based compensation related to a share price and a $15 million additional contribution to our charitable foundation. Marketing expense was also up $8 million from the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality remains strong. For the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were $135 million or 53 basis points of average loans, slightly below our guidance range. Our provision for credit losses was $20 million. This was determined under the CECL methodology and based on our continued strong credit metrics and leading indicators as well as our outlook for the overall economy, credit migration and loan production. Nonperforming loans were $785 million this quarter or 78 basis points of period-end loans compared to $834 million or 81 basis points from the prior quarter. Additionally, 30 to 89-day delinquencies actually improved quarter-over-quarter with a 9 basis point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remained relatively flat. 
We've continued to monitor the level of assistance requests we receive from our customers. Over the past quarter, the number of requests for loan forbearance has decreased dramatically. As of December 31, loans subject to forbearance terms were less than $600 million, down from a peak of $1.2 billion, equating to about 0.5% of our outstanding balances. One more observation this quarter, and as Chris mentioned earlier, in late December, the results of the most recent stress test results were published. Key's results reinforce the commitments we have been making over the past several years that we are a different company with a better risk profile than Key showed through The Great Recession. Our stressed credit losses for -- from the test were peer leading. We've been managing the company over the last decade to outperform during challenging times and believe we have positioned the company to achieve this. 
Turning to Slide 12. We updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are receiving greater focus in this environment. These areas represent a small percentage of the total loan balances. Each relationship in these focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhance monitoring. Importantly, as a group, they continue to perform consistent with our expectations. Now on to Slide 13. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the fourth quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, up 30 basis points from 9.5% in the third quarter. This places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, the results of the recent stress test support and highlight our strong credit profile and loss-absorbing capital. 
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $900 million for the next 3 quarters. They also approved our first quarter 2021 common dividend of $0.185 per share. On Slide 14, we provide our full year 2021 outlook. This builds on our performance in 2020 and reflects our expectation that we will deliver positive operating leverage for the year. Guidance range definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide. Average loans are expected to be relatively stable. Although at this point, I would expect a little downward bias to this range. This reflects participation in the next round of PPP and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolio from both Laurel Road and our consumer mortgage business. We expect deposits to be up low single digits, and we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base. income should be relatively stable. Our net interest income will benefit from our higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates. 
Non-interest income should be up low single digits, reflecting growth in most of our core fee-based businesses. As Chris mentioned, noninterest expense should be down in 2021, somewhere in the low single-digit range. We will continue to benefit from our continuous improvement efforts and accelerate our branch closures. We also plan to continue to invest in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings. Moving on to credit quality. Net charge-offs to average loans should be in the 50 to 60 basis point range, which is consistent with our through the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate should be around 19% for the year. Our guidance also assumes some variability over the course of the year. First quarter will reflect normal seasonality, including a lower day count and an increase in personnel expense driven by heightened employee benefits. Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. As Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for 2021. We also maintain our moderate risk profile, and over time, continue to improve our efficiency and overall returns. I'll close with where Chris started. 
Recognizing the effort of our team to support our clients and to deliver strong results for both the quarter and the year despite the challenging environment. We are well positioned as we head into 2021 and plan to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. John?"

Well, thanks for the question. Just to step back for a second. Our integrated corporate  and investment bank is a unique and growing franchise. It's unique among all of our peers. It's really hard both to coordinate and collaborate and get it done from a cultural perspective. And as you know, Scott, we've been at it for a long time. And we've made a bunch of significant investments. If you think about the investments we've made in technology and in health care. Within any year, there's always variability. But as we step back and look at that business over the past 5 years, it's had a compound annual growth rate of about 8%. And so -- and if you look at from 2015 to present, I think we've had 1 year, where we were down slightly, I think, last year, down like 3%. So I'm just giving you that is kind of a backdrop as we look forward. There's no question that it's the transaction business, and there's a lot of variables that clearly are not within our control. Having said that, for us, it's a relationship business, we continue to grow it. Our pipelines today are strong. Our pipelines are in good shape. And what's interesting about our business is whereas a lot of people had a huge lift from investment-grade debt through the pandemic, that really is not core to our business. Our business was really driven, Scott, by a big surge in M&A and syndications, in some cases, related syndications. So we feel good about the trajectory of the business, and we'll continue to invest in it."

And so a lot of it's repriced already, but there's still some. That dynamic happened not just for you guys, but for other banks as well. So can you discuss whether you expect downward pressure on loan yields to persist in this cycle as well? And are you simply going to work through to offset those headwinds? And is there anything, I guess, different about this cycle that leads you to expect those dynamics to play out any differently at this time?"

One, on the loan book that -- keep in mind that a significant portion of the swaps that we enter into from a balance sheet perspective are matched up against the commercial loan book. And so it does convert some of those over to fixed rates and we've talked over the last couple of quarters about the impact of those swaps going forward. And so you will see some very modest pressure on yields coming from that as those swaps roll over. On the consumer book, we are seeing rates coming down as far as the new originations compared to what was the existing book, but we're also seeing improved credit quality for those new originations. And we're also seeing margins a little wider on the consumer originations compared to the current rate environment than where we've been historically. And so that will also help. And so there will be some pressure going forward, but I would say that we still have other levers to help offset that, including the full year benefit of the repricing of our deposit book that we realized in the fourth quarter. And then also just this excess liquidity position, we think, over time, we can start to absorb some of that and maybe reinvest that over time as well."

And so that accelerated about $28 million of fee income for the quarter. And so that roughly added about 6 basis points or so as far as the overall margin. And so that clearly was additive. If you look at that first wave of PPP loans, we had about $8 billion of issuance, that as I mentioned, we had about $1.3 billion of forgiveness this quarter. And so that is about $6.7 billion. We would expect about 80% of that initial $8 billion be forgiven. And so you'll see that come throughout the rest of the year. I would say that, for example, we would expect about $1 billion of forgiveness in the first quarter. And so that's a little less than what we would have seen in the fourth quarter, but still continue to show that kind of a pace. The next wave of PPP will be helpful for that, and we would expect to see about $2.5 billion of originations in the second quarter. And so some of that decline that we would be expecting from that forgiveness will be directly offset by the new originations, and we'll probably start the end of the first quarter with balances of over $8 billion. And so I think that is helpful as far as just the perspective there. As far as the fee income component to it, that if you look at both the normal accretion of the fee income plus the acceleration coming from the forgiveness, that was about $110 million of fee income for 2020. We would expect for the first wave of those $8 billion of loans, that number would be up to around $120 million or so as far as the fee income from both normal accretion and also the impact of forgiveness. And so we have a little bit of a lift on a year-over-year basis from that. And then on top of that, we would have the benefit from the new wave 2 of the PPP program coming through with loan yields and fee income realization from those credits as well."

And that growth really coming from both residential mortgage and from Laurel Road. Just to put that in perspective, we had almost $600 million of originations from Laurel Road in the fourth quarter. Just continuing at that pace would be in the $2.5 billion type of range as far as 2021 originations from that category. On the residential mortgage side that despite what we're seeing and hearing in the industry that we think that we can actually show stable to maybe even increasing our overall residential mortgage originations in 2021. But keep in mind that we are at the early stages as far as rolling out that platform throughout our branch network, seeing strong growth there. And of that $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and of the $8.3 billion for the full year, about half of that was for purchase money as opposed to refinance. And so we think there still will be opportunities to continue to show growth there, and that's adding over $1 billion a quarter as far as the new loan originations in the residential mortgage side. And so that consumer growth in those 2 areas specifically are at the foundation of how we can get to that kind of relatively stable outlook for total loans."

We would expect expenses down considerably from where they were in the fourth quarter, but probably up from what we would have seen last year. Last year, our revenue outlook was negatively impacted by some market valuation adjustments that also had a corresponding adjustment to our incentive compensation. And so we think that we'll be in a position to generate positive operating leverage for the first quarter and have positive operating leverage for the full year.

I don't know how to predict where the economic outlook will shift over time. But I would say as we go into 2021, that the 3 pieces that impact our provision expense under CECL are: one, the economic outlook. And so assuming that's stable with what we would have predicted, won't see any impact there. Credit migration has been a positive for us. And each quarter, as we take a look at what our projected credit losses are, that trend continues to get better. And so that's allowing for reductions to the provision compared to normal. And then the third piece is for loan production. I mentioned on the call a couple of times in the last few quarters is that provision each quarter would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. And so if the economic outlook doesn't change and if the migration is consistent with expectations, that would imply about a $90 million per quarter provision expense on average and about $360 million for the year, which would be below what that charge-off guidance would imply. And so we would expect to see that allowance ratio come down over time and could have some opportunity to see that come down more quickly if we continue to see the credit migration outperform like we have."

I think last year, we probably placed $11 billion with our targeted customers in our real estate book. As it relates to C&I, we haven't yet seen growth. If you're looking at utilization, Erika, it is now at or below even pre pandemic. We haven't seen people investing in property, plant, equipment, investing in people. But what we have seen, and I think is a very good sign, and you saw it in our investment banking numbers in the fourth quarter, is people are starting to make strategic moves. And so we're having great strategic discussions with our clients and our prospects. And I think people are thinking now with the election behind us, with the vaccine rollout of really what are they going to do to grow their business. So I too am optimistic that we'll see an increase in line utilization and that we'll see people start to invest in their business. The other thing that would obviously be helpful for line utilization because if we had a bit of inflation, if people actually started investing and going long in inventory, and I think that's an unrealistic scenario as you think about the back half of the year."

We have increased efforts around making sure that we have that expanded full depository/operating account relationship there as well. And so those will be helpful. It would also reflect the assumptions like we saw last year that as the PPP loans were originated, a good portion of those proceeds were deposited into deposit accounts with our customers. And so we would expect to see some some lift from that. And then just the most recent round of stimulus also adds deposit balances. And each quarter this year, we tried to estimate where our deposit flows will be. And I think each quarter, we probably underestimated where they actually come through. And so I think the customers continue to have liquidity and continue to build those positions. And that's essentially why we're assuming that we'll have continued growth there as well."

Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
This morning, Key reported record revenue and earnings. But before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to share a couple of broader and contextual comments. I am very proud of the way our team continues to navigate the pandemic and related economic downturn. Their dedication, combined with our investments in talent and digital capabilities, continue to serve the company, our clients, our communities and our shareholders well. Throughout 2020, we successfully executed what I call our dual mandate. By that I mean responding to the pandemic, which is a real humanitarian and economic crisis, while continuing to position Key for both growth and success.
We have taken countless steps to ensure that our teammates and our clients are both safe and well served. Additionally, we provided billions of dollars in credit to our clients. In 2020, we originated more than 43,000 loans amounting to $8 billion through the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. In fact, we are currently assisting our clients through the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program as we speak.
As part of our National Community Benefits Plan, we provided billions of dollars in support to our communities. This included affordable housing, home lending and small business lending in low- and moderate-income communities, transformative philanthropy and renewable energy financing. Our commitment also includes programs to advance social justice and economic inclusion across all the communities we serve. And finally, I want to thank our teammates for rising to every challenge in 2020 in a way that kept our clients at the center of everything we do.
I am now turning to Slide 3. Getting back to our performance in the fourth quarter, we achieved a record level of revenue for both the quarter and the year, the growth in net interest income and fee income. Net interest income was up almost 4% from the prior quarter with an 8 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Fee income, also a record, up double digits for both the prior quarter and the year ago period. We continue to benefit from investments that we have made across our company, which drove both fee income and balance sheet growth.
Let me touch on 3 specific areas. First, consumer mortgage. We achieved record volume in the fourth quarter with $2.5 billion in funded loans. For the full year, our consumer mortgage originations were $8.3 billion, up 90% from the prior year. This drove both balance sheet growth as well as a 179% increase in fee income. Approximately 1/2 of our originations last year were purchase mortgages. Our pipelines remain strong, and we expect to continue to both grow and take share.
The second area I will highlight is investment banking. This is an area where we have invested in talent and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including areas such as health care and technology. In the fourth quarter, we generated $243 million in fees, which represents a record quarter. We enjoyed broad-based growth across the platform, with particular strength in M&A and loan syndications. 2020 was a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong. We believe this business will continue to be a growth engine for us in the future.
The third area is Laurel Road and, more broadly, the investments we have made in digital across our company. Laurel Road continues to originate high-quality loans that provide us with an opportunity to build broader digital relationships with health care professionals. Last year, Laurel Road originated over $2.3 billion in loans. At the end of March, we will launch our digital bank serving the health care segment, expanding our consumer franchise nationally. This launch will broaden our offering for Laurel Road clients to include deposits, additional lending products and other value-added services. We believe that both Laurel Road and consumer mortgage will continue to be relationship-based growth engines for our consumer business.
Our expenses this quarter were elevated. They were elevated due to higher production-related incentives, severance and the funding of our philanthropic foundation. Additionally, COVID-related expenses and costs associated with our prepaid card also remained elevated again this quarter. Don will cover the outlook in his remarks, but we expect expenses to come down in 2021, while concurrently investing in talent and digital capabilities.
This year, we will also be accelerating the pace of branch closures. We expect to consolidate over 70 branches, representing 7% of our network. Most of these closures taking place in the first half of the year. Our decisions are driven by client behavior as more activity continues to move toward digital channels, it's also informed by our robust analytics. We expect limited client attrition as a high percentage of the impacted branches are located within 2 miles of another Key facility.
Importantly, we expect to continue to grow our retail business, while reducing operating expenses and improving overall profitability. Credit quality remained strong this quarter, with net charge-offs of 53 basis points, within our targeted over the cycle range. Additionally, nonperforming loans declined by almost $50 million this quarter. We will continue to support our clients, while maintaining our moderate risk profile and concurrently positioning the company to perform well through the business cycle.
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. The results of our recent stress tests affirmed that Key is a different company today, with loss rates and loss-absorbing capital among the best in our peer group.
Our strategic positioning allows us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, supporting organic growth, paying dividends and, of course, share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $900 million over the next 3 quarters. We also approved our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.185 a share.
In closing, despite the challenging environment of the last year, we were able to support our clients, invest in and grow our businesses, while maintaining our strong risk practices. Our success was driven by our dedicated team, the strength of our business model and our relentless focus on executing our strategy. I am confident in Key's future. We are positioned to succeed and continue to deliver on all of our commitments.
I will now turn it over to Don, who will provide details on our quarter in addition to our outlook for the coming year. Don?"

As Chris said, it was a very strong quarter for us, with record net income from continuing operations of $0.56 per common share, up 37% from prior quarter and 24% from the prior year ago period. Return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was over 16%, up over 400 basis points from the third quarter. I will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation.
Turning to Slide 6. Total average loans were $102 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflect an increase of over $7.5 billion from the PPP loans. Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and, as Chris mentioned, strong performance from our consumer mortgage business. Laurel Road originated $590 million of loans this quarter and $2.3 billion for the full year, up over 20% from the full year 2019.
We also generated another record $2.5 billion of consumer mortgage loans in the quarter, bringing the total for the year to $8.3 billion. The investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and, importantly, add high-quality loans to our portfolio.
Linked quarter average loan balances were down 3%, reflecting paydowns from the heightened commercial loan draws as well as a small reduction in PPP balances related to initial forgiveness. Line utilization rates are at the prepandemic levels given the strong liquidity levels in the environment. Importantly, we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well through the business cycle, and we manage our credit quality with this longer-term perspective.
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $136 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, up $23 billion or 21% compared to the year ago period and up 0.6% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter increase reflected broad-based commercial growth as well as growth from our -- from higher consumer balances. The growth was offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 11 basis points from the third quarter of 2020, exceeding our guidance of a 6 to 9 basis point decline. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of the total deposit mix.
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.043 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $987 million a year ago and just over $1 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.70% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.98% for the same period last year and 2.62% from the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income, but reduced the net interest margin due to significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $37 million, and the margin improved by 8 basis points. The increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin quarter-over-quarter are largely due to the lower interest-bearing deposit cost and the higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness. We saw the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined 11 basis points from the prior quarter. The forgiveness of the PPP loans accelerated about $28 million of additional fee recognition this quarter. These were partially offset by continued elevated liquidity levels, which had a 5 basis point negative impact on the margin.
Moving to Slide 9. Our fee-based businesses hit all-time highs in the fourth quarter. Noninterest income was $802 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $651 million for the year ago period and $681 million for the third quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased $151 million. The primary driver was a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $243 million, up $62 million from the year ago period. Stronger M&A and loan syndication fees drove most of the increase this quarter. This business also had a record year with $661 million of total fees.
Record mortgage originations drove consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $22 million from the fourth quarter of '19. Cards and payments income also increased $30 million related to higher prepaid card activity from the state government support programs. Compared to the third quarter, noninterest income increased by $121 million. The largest driver of the quarterly increase was once again the record quarter for investment banking, which was up $97 million. Commercial mortgage servicing fees also had a strong quarter, up $14 million.
I'm now turning to Slide 11 -- excuse me, Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.128 billion compared to $980 million last year and $1.037 billion in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel costs driven by higher production-related incentives from our record fee production as well as higher severance costs. Year-over-year, payments-related costs reported and other expense were $40 million higher driven by higher prepaid activity, and we incurred COVID-19-related expenses to ensure the health and safety of our teammates. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $91 million. The increase was largely due to $40 million of higher production-related incentives, $22 million of severance, $12 million of higher stock-based compensation related to the share price and a $15 million additional contribution to our charitable foundation. Marketing expense was also up $8 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality remains strong. For the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were $135 million or 53 basis points of average loans, slightly below our guidance range. Our provision for credit losses was $20 million. This was determined under the CECL methodology and based on our continued strong credit metrics and leading indicators as well as our outlook for the overall economy, credit migration and loan production.
Nonperforming loans were $785 million this quarter or 78 basis points of period-end loans compared to $834 million or 81 basis points from the prior quarter. Additionally, 30- to 89-day delinquencies actually improved quarter-over-quarter with a 9 basis point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remained relatively flat. We've continued to monitor the level of assistance requests we receive from our customers. Over the past quarter, the number of requests for loan forbearance have decreased dramatically. As of December 31, loans subject to forbearance terms were less than $600 million, down from a peak of $5.2 billion, equating to about 0.5% of our outstanding balances.
One more observation this quarter, and as Chris mentioned earlier, in late December, the results of the most recent stress test results were published. Key's results reinforce the commitments we have been making over the past several years that we are a different company with a better risk profile than Key showed through The Great Recession. Our stress credit losses for the -- from the test were peer leading. We've been managing the company over the last decade to outperform during challenging times and believe we have positioned the company to achieve this.
Turning to Slide 12. We updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are receiving greater focus in this environment. These areas represent a small percentage of the total loan balances. Each relationship in these focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhance monitoring. Importantly, as a group, they continue to perform consistent with our expectations.
Now on to Slide 13. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the fourth quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, up 30 basis points from 9.5% in the third quarter. This places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with a sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, the results of the recent stress test support and highlight our strong credit profile and loss-absorbing capital.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $900 million for the next 3 quarters. They also approved our first quarter 2021 common dividend of $0.185 per share.
On Slide 14, we've provided our full year 2021 outlook. This builds on our performance in 2020 and reflects our expectation that we will deliver positive operating leverage for the year. Guidance range definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide. Average loans are expected to be relatively stable. Although at this point, I would expect a little downward bias to this range. This reflects participation in the next round of PPP and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolio from both Laurel Road and our consumer mortgage business. We expect deposits to be up low single digits, and we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base. Net interest income should be relatively stable. Our net interest income will benefit from our higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates.
Noninterest income should be up low single digits, reflecting growth in most of our core fee-based businesses. As Chris mentioned, noninterest expense should be down in 2021, somewhere in the low single-digit range. We will continue to benefit from our continuous improvement efforts and accelerate our branch closures. We also plan to continue to invest in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings.
Moving on to credit quality. Net charge-offs to average loans should be in the 50 to 60 basis point range, which is consistent with our through the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate should be around 19% for the year. Our guidance also assumes some variability over the course of the year. First quarter will reflect normal seasonality, including a lower day count and an increase in personnel expense driven by heightened employee benefit costs.
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. As Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for 2021. We also maintain our moderate risk profile, and over time, continue to improve our efficiency and overall returns. I'll close with where Chris started, recognizing the effort of our team to support our clients and to deliver strong results for both the quarter and the year despite the challenging environment. We are well positioned as we head into 2021 and plan to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. John?"

Well, thanks for the question. Just to step back for a second. Our integrated corporate  and investment bank is a unique in growing franchise. It's unique among all of our peers. It's really hard both to coordinate and collaborate and get it done from a cultural perspective. And as you know, Scott, we've been at it for a long time. And we've made a bunch of significant investments.
If you think about the investments we've made in technology and in health care, within any year, there's always variability. But as we step back and look at that business over the past 5 years, it's had a compound annual growth rate of about 8%. And so -- and if you look at from 2015 to present, I think we've had 1 year, where we were down slightly. I think last year, we were down like 3%. So I'm just giving you that as kind of a backdrop as we look forward.
There's no question that it's the transaction business, and there's a lot of variables that clearly are not within our control. Having said that, for us, it's a relationship business, we continue to grow it. Our pipelines today are strong. Our pipelines are in good shape. What's interesting about our business is whereas a lot of people had a huge lift from investment-grade debt through the pandemic, that really is not core to our business. Our business was really driven, Scott, by a big surge in M&A and syndications, in some cases, related syndications. So we feel good about the trajectory of the business, and we'll continue to invest in it."

One, on the loan book that -- keep in mind that a significant portion of the swaps that we enter into from a balance sheet perspective are matched up against the commercial loan book. And so it does convert some of those over to fixed rates and we've talked over the last couple of quarters about the impact of those swaps going forward. And so you will see some very modest pressure on yields coming from that as those swaps roll over.
On the consumer book, we are seeing rates coming down as far as the new originations compared to what was the existing book, but we're also seeing improved credit quality for those new originations. And we're also seeing margins a little wider on the consumer originations compared to the current rate environment than where we've been historically. And so that will also help.
And so there will be some pressure going forward, but I would say that we still have other levers to help offset that, including the full year benefit of the repricing of our deposit book that we realized in the fourth quarter. And then also just this excess liquidity position, we think, over time, we can start to absorb some of that and maybe reinvest that over time as well."

And so that accelerated about $28 million of fee income for the quarter. And so that roughly added about 6 basis points or so as far as the overall margin. And so that clearly was additive.
If you look at that first wave of PPP loans, we had about $8 billion of issuance, that as I mentioned, we had about $1.3 billion of forgiveness this quarter and so that puts about $6.7 billion. We would expect about 80% of that initial $8 billion to be forgiven. And so you'll see that come throughout the rest of the year. I would say that, for example, we would expect about $1 billion of forgiveness in the first quarter. And so that's a little less than what we would have seen in the fourth quarter, but still continue to show that kind of a pace.
The next wave of PPP will be helpful for that, and we would expect to see about $2.5 billion of originations in the second quarter. And so some of that decline that we would be expecting from that forgiveness will be directly offset by the new originations, and we'll probably start the end of the first quarter with balances of over $8 billion. And so I think that is helpful as far as just the perspective there.
As far as the fee income component to it, that if you look at both the normal accretion of the fee income plus the acceleration coming from the forgiveness, that was about $110 million of fee income for 2020. We would expect for the first wave of those $8 billion of loans, that number would be up to around $120 million or so as far as the fee income from both normal accretion and also the impact of forgiveness. And so we have a little bit of a lift on a year-over-year basis from that. And then on top of that, we would have the benefit from the new wave 2 of the PPP program coming through with loan yields and fee income realization from those credits as well."

Just continuing at that pace would be in the $2.5 billion type of range as far as 2021 originations from that category.
On the residential mortgage side that despite what we're seeing and hearing in the industry that we think that we can actually show stable to maybe even increasing our overall residential mortgage originations in 2021. But keep in mind that we are at the early stages as far as rolling out that platform throughout our branch network, seeing strong growth there. And of that $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and of the $8.3 billion for the full year, about half of that was for purchase money as opposed to refinance. And so we think there still will be opportunities to continue to show growth there. And that's adding over $1 billion a quarter as far as the new loan originations in the residential mortgage side.

Last year, our revenue outlook was negatively impacted by some market valuation adjustments that also had a corresponding adjustment to our incentive compensation. And so we think that we'll be in a position to generate positive operating leverage for the first quarter and have positive operating leverage for the full year.

Credit migration has been a positive for us. And each quarter, as we take a look at what our projected credit losses are, that trend continues to get better. And so that's allowing for reductions to the provision compared to normal.
And then the third piece is for loan production. I mentioned on the call a couple of times in the last few quarters is that provision each quarter would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. And so if the economic outlook doesn't change and if the migration is consistent with expectations, that would imply about a $90 million per quarter provision expense on average and about $360 million for the year, which would be below what that charge-off guidance would imply. And so we would expect to see that allowance ratio come down over time and could have some opportunity to see that come down more quickly if we continue to see the credit migration outperform like we have."

Kind of more tactically, we think about sort of the key areas where I think you could see significant degradation in asset values and, fortunately, we're well positioned here. But I think obvious ones are travel and entertainment. I think that's -- as you point out, I think that, that will come back because I think the vaccine has a lot to do with that. I think hospitality industry is one that you need to focus on. The other couple of areas, and as you know, we've been out of them by strategy is both retail and office.

As far as the outlook for net interest income and some of the assumptions we have there for the reinvestment, in the fourth quarter, we increased our core investment portfolio by about $3 billion. And that was investing at a faster pace than the runoff. And I would -- and our outlook would have some of that same type of pace continuing throughout the current year that we're currently sitting on over $14 billion in cash and about $2 billion in T-bills that we think would be available for us to continue to redeploy either through loan growth or through reinvestment. And so that would be the core assumption that we have there.
Just on that component that for the roughly $6 billion that we invested this quarter, the average reinvestment yield was about 1.28%, so down from what the runoff level would be. But reflected some of the strategy as far as investing in certain securities and then swapping them back so that, say, 5 years down the road, those fixed rate securities would convert over to floating rate. So our expectation would be to continue that kind of a strategy going forward.

As Don mentioned, loan growth, first of all, consumer is an area that will continue to be an outlier of growth for us, and I think we're well positioned for that. Next area, if you think about commercial real estate, we have a very, very good franchise. We're actually not growing the on-balance sheet debt there and that's by strategy. I think last year, we probably placed $11 billion with our targeted customers in our real estate book. As it relates to C&I, we haven't yet seen growth.
If you're looking at utilization, Erika, it is now at or below even prepandemic. We haven't seen people investing in property, plant, equipment, investing in people. But what we have seen, and I think is a very good sign, and you saw it in our investment banking numbers in the fourth quarter, is people are starting to make strategic moves. And so we're having great strategic discussions with our clients and our prospects. And I think people are thinking now with the election behind us, with the vaccine rollout of really what are they going to do to grow their business.
So I too am optimistic that we'll see an increase in line utilization and that we'll see people start to invest in their business. The other thing that would obviously be helpful for line utilization because if we had a bit of inflation, if people actually started investing and going long in inventory, and I think that's an unrealistic scenario as you think about the back half of the year."

As it relates to nonbanks, I'm really proud of the job we've done over many years of being able to buy entrepreneurial firms and successfully integrating them into our business.

It was a born digital company that we've been able to really, not only integrate into our business, but actually, helps Key grow -- helped both Key and Laurel Road have grown.

And so those will be helpful.
It would also reflect the assumptions like we saw last year that as the PPP loans were originated, a good portion of those proceeds were deposited into deposit accounts with our customers. And so we would expect to see some lift from that. And then just the most recent round of stimulus also adds deposit balances.
And each quarter this year, we've tried to estimate where our deposit flows will be. And I think each quarter, we probably underestimated where they actually come through.

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our first quarter was a strong start to the year as we executed our strategy and delivered positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago period. We continue to grow the number of clients across our franchise. In the first quarter, we experienced the strongest growth in consumer households in 5 years. 
Additionally, we continue to add commercial clients and deepen existing relationships. We leverage the strength of our business model by raising over $13 billion for our commercial clients of which we retained approximately 19% on our balance sheet. 
And let me just say that's exactly the way our model is designed to work, taking advantage of attractive markets for the benefit of our clients while maintaining our credit discipline with that which we place on our balance sheet. 
We also launched our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors at the end of March. I will comment more on that shortly. In addition, we announced the acquisition of AQN Strategies, a client-focused analytics firm with deep expertise in the financial services industry. 
The acquisition aligns to Key's relationship strategy and underscores our commitment to a data-driven approach to grow our business. We also identified 70 branches for consolidation representing approximately 7% of our network. We continue to lean into digital. Most of these closures will take place in the second quarter. 
Moving to our financial results for the quarter. We reported net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter. On a per share basis, this is an increase of 9% from the fourth quarter results and up significantly from the year ago period. 
We generated record first quarter revenue, which reflected broad-based growth across our company, driven by our fee-based businesses. Our Investment Banking business achieved record first quarter revenues with growth across the platform. This is an area where we have invested in our teammates and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including such areas as health care and technology. 
We have grown this business in 8 of the last 9 years, including having a record year in 2020. And we expect to grow this business again in 2021. We reached a milestone in our consumer mortgage business with record loan originations of $3 billion for the quarter. 
In addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year ago period. Our outlook for this business remains positive as we continue to grow and take market share. 
We reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we expect to eclipse that level this year. Other contributors to fee income this quarter were trust and investment services and cards and payments income. Credit quality remains strong. Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter. 
We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through the business cycle. 
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. Our strong capital position enables us to execute against our capital priorities, organic growth, dividends and share repurchases. 
This quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares. Our Board of Directors also approved our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.185 a share. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Before I turn the call over to Don, I wanted to make a few comments regarding Laurel Road. We acquired Laurel Road, a born digital company in April of 2019. The acquisition has exceeded all of our expectations. It has accelerated our digital transformation and has been a great complement to our existing health care platform. 
Since our acquisition, Laurel Road has generated over $4.6 billion in high-quality loan originations adding high-value digital relationships with health care professionals. We also have the opportunity to continue to scale this business. At the end of March, we took the next step on this journey with the launch of our Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, serving the health care segment and expanding our consumer franchise nationally. 
Importantly, our approach to our Digital Bank is differentiated. Historically, many offerings have been product-centric or focused on deposit gathering. Ours is fully -- is fully aligned with our relationship strategy. The launch broadened our offering for Laurel Road clients to include deposits, additional lending products and other value-added services created to meet the unique financial needs of health care professionals. 
The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, health care and primacy. Right now, we are focused on physicians and dentists, but soon, we will expand to other medical professionals. 
Importantly, this launch is not the end goal, but rather just the beginning. 
I will close my remarks by restating that I am pleased with our results for the quarter and our strong start for 2021. I am proud of what we have achieved as a team and remain optimistic about the future as we emerge from the pandemic and the economy continues to recover. 
Key is well positioned to grow and deliver on our commitments for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to now turn it over to Don to walk through the quarter. Don?"

As Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over 4x from the year ago period. 
The quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. The reserve release was largely driven by expected improvement in the economic environment. Importantly, we generated a record first quarter revenue, driven by the strength in our fee-based businesses. 
I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 7. Total average loans were $101 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflected Key's participation in PPP, partially offset by decreased utilization. PPP loans had an impact of $7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 average balances. Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter. 
The investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships. Linked quarter average loan balances were down 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances. We had just under $1 billion of PPP forgiveness in the current quarter. 
Consumer loans were up 1% from the prior quarter, again related to continued production from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. Average deposits totaled $138 billion for the first quarter of 2021, up $28 billion or 25% compared to the year ago period and up 1.5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year-ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus. The growth was offset by continued and expected decline in time deposits. The interest-bearing deposit costs came down another 3 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020, following an 8 basis point decline last quarter. 
We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.012 billion for the first quarter of 2021 and compared to $989 million a year ago and $1.043 billion for the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.61% for the first quarter of 2021 and compared to 3.01% for the same period last year and 2.7% from the prior quarter. 
Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. 
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income decreased $31 million and the margin declined 9 basis points. The decrease in net interest income was caused by the day count of approximately $14 million, lower loan fees of $8 million and lower loan balances resulting in an additional $8 million reduction to NII. 
Net interest margin also reflected a 4 basis point reduction due to the increases in our liquidity position. 
Moving on to Slide 10. We have continued to see growth in our fee-based businesses. Noninterest income was $738 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $477 million for the year ago period and $802 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 55%. 
We had a record first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $162 million driven by broad-based strength across the platform. This quarter, both debt and equity markets were especially strong. Record mortgage originations drove mortgage -- consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $27 million or 135% from the first quarter of '20. Cards and payments income also increased $39 million related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs as well as the growth in the core platform. 
Other income in the year ago period included $92 million of market-related valuation adjustments. Compared to the fourth quarter, noninterest income decreased by $64 million. Largest driver of the quarterly decrease was seasonality in our investment banking line coming off an all-time high record quarter. This was partially offset by the strength in trust and investment services income, in cards and payments income. 
I'm now on Slide 11. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.071 billion compared to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation, which increased $58 million and the increase in our stock price resulting in a $36 million increase compared to last year. 
Employee benefit costs also increased $15 million. Year-over-year, payments-related costs reported in other expense were $32 million higher, driven by higher prepaid activity. Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform, accounting changes and timing differences. 
Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense decreased $57 million. The decline was largely due to lower production-related incentives and severance costs. 
Moving now to Slide 12. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the first quarter, net charge-offs were $114 million or 46 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $93 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production. 
Nonperforming loans were $728 million this quarter or 72 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of almost $60 million from the prior quarter. Additionally, criticized loans declined and the 30- to 90-day delinquencies also improved again quarter-over-quarter with a 5 basis point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remain relatively flat. 
I'm now on to Slide 13. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the first quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%.  This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. 
Our Board of Directors approved a first quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. We also repurchased $135 million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in January of up to $900 million. This leaves us with a capacity of up to $765 million for the next 2 quarters. 
On Slide 14, we provide our full year 2021 outlook, which we've adjusted to reflect our strong start to the year, positive momentum in our business and more favorable revenue outlook. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year. Average loans are expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of PPP and stronger commercial growth in the second half of the year. 
The first quarter should be the low point of the year with expected growth from here. We expect deposits to be up mid-single digits and that we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base. 
Net interest income should be up low single digits. Our net interest income will benefit from higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates. 
Noninterest income should be up mid-single digits, reflecting the growth in most of our core fee-based businesses. Noninterest expense should be relatively stable, reflecting higher production-based incentives related to our improved revenue outlook. Our continuous improvement efforts and branch consolidation plans remain on track and will help support our ongoing investments in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings. 
Moving on to credit quality. We have reduced our net charge-off guidance, which is now expected to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range for the year. This reflects the quality of our portfolio and our current outlook. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at around 19% for the year. 
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. 
Overall, it was a good start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?"

That would be an example of where these middle market companies are consistently opting to go to other other sources of funding other than the banks.

On the consumer side, we had a record year in terms -- a record quarter, I beg your pardon, in terms of number of new households. We also had a record quarter in terms of mortgage originations at $3 billion. So we have a lot of trajectory on the consumer side. The consumer is spending. 
And while you don't see it in credit card balances because at origination, our average consumer has a FICO score of around 770, What you do see it in is the velocity in both debit and credit. We believe that our growth engines in consumer, last year, we generated about $10 billion of originations between Laurel Road and mortgage. We think we will do more than that this year. And that trajectory is -- they're up and running. 
Let's talk about commercial a little bit, which is clearly delayed. First of all, commercial right now, we have really unprecedented utilization as in low utilization. So I think 1 of the areas where we can grow from a commercial perspective is as  there are supply chain challenges, as there is clearly some inflation out there. 
I think you'll see people start to build their inventory. And I would suspect we'll see utilization improve from the low point that it is now. As I mentioned, there's a lot of strategic discussions going on that should generate loan growth. What we're not seeing right now is investment in people and property, plant and equipment. And I would guess on the people front, 1 of the challenges for our customers is it's hard to hire people. So that's 1 of the challenges. But on property, plant and equipment, I would expect that to ramp up in the second half. These projects, as you know, take a fair amount of lead time. So consumer, strong throughout the year. I think commercial is going to be relatively flat in the first half and will pick up in the second half."

And just using the midpoint, net interest income is up about $80 million. And roughly $45 million to $50 million of that is coming from the improved rate outlook that we've seen with the  rate curve moving up and just the impact of that in the overall portfolio. 
If you take a look at the loan balances overall that I would say that they're up very modestly, but it really shows a little bit more of a mix improvement there as far as the yield impact. As Chris highlighted, that we had record mortgage originations of $3 billion this past quarter. We've increased our outlook as far as the overall mortgage balances going onto the balance sheet and pull back a little bit on the commercial given the lower utilization rates we saw in the first quarter. 
And so that mix shift also helped a little bit. As far as PPP. We talked on the call in January about we thought that with the new loans that we'd be seeing coming through with the current wave of PPP, if you take a look at the net interest income, which includes both the 1% interest plus the fee income, we thought that'd be up about $80 million year-over-year. And that's about the same as what we're seeing this year as far as our outlook in April. 
And so we're still seeing that kind of an incremental benefit. And then as far as the forgiveness, we would expect of last year's production of the $8 billion about 85% of that to be forgiven throughout the remainder of this year. And so we will see that acceleration occur as far as some of the fee income in future quarters compared to what we experienced in the first quarter. But generally fairly consistent with what we would have expected back in January."

And as we mentioned earlier, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter one of the drivers of why our NII was down was about $8 million lower loan fees and some of that was related to the PPP because we had higher levels of forgiveness in the fourth quarter than what we actually did in the first quarter of this year. 
And so as far as the PPP impact, we would expect that the total NII level contributed for first quarter versus the rest of the year to continue to trend down a little bit, very modestly at first and thinking of $1 million or $2 million a quarter coming from that just with the impact of the forgiveness of those loans. But generally, again, fairly consistent with what we would have expected coming into the year as far as the trajectory and our outlook for those balances."

When you look at this long term, how do you size up the expected overall impact and maybe as a percentage of revenue or earnings or returns or even percentage of loans on the loan side or deposits. Just want to help people think about how big this thing can be."

Obviously, health care is rapidly approaching 20% of the GDP. So there is a huge opportunity. And as you look throughout Key, we do a lot of business in health care throughout our franchise. 
For example, while not part of Laurel Road, doctors and dentists are a significant driver of our mortgage business, for example. And if you think about serving these large hospitals and what we can do for the CEO in terms of provide him strategic advice, raise capital at the -- dealing with the CFO, a lot we can do around payments. And then with the Chief Human Resources Officer, the ability to refinance student loans, the ability for docs to manage their money. We have $45 billion of AUM. 
So it is a huge opportunity. We haven't yet laid it out for the public yet what our targets are. As it relates specifically to Laurel Road, last year, we generated $2.3 billion in loan refinancing. This year, in spite of, frankly, some of the noise around student lending in general, we will continue to grow that business. So that's just a data point for you."

As far as our securities portfolio that we did add to both the core book as well as a short-term treasury book. We've got as of the end of the period, about a $5 billion over the last 2 quarters increase in the core bond portfolio. That was really done in some of the core type of products and investments we would normally invest in, which would include CMOs and 15-year pass-throughs. We also did some commercial mortgage agency securities as well and attached swaps to those so that basically it locks in that fixed rate for the first, say, 4 to 6 years. 
And then converts it to a nice loading rate for us. And so the average yield on those purchases was around $140 million. The roll-off of our existing portfolio is around a $2.35 to $2.40 range. And so we do see continued pressure there based on where the the current rates are, but is just consistent with what we're seeing in the markets overall. 
As far as that short-term treasury portion of the portfolio, we added again, about $5 billion also over the last 2 quarters. The average yield on that is about 40 basis points. And well, that's fairly low. It's a fairly short duration of the portfolio and really is just representing a safe substitute for the cash position as we're continuing to maintain cash levels of about $15 billion, which is from our target level of about $1 billion and no more than $2 billion. 
And so just something we'll continue to evaluate as far as the overall outlook as far as putting some of those additional dollars to work. And hopefully, we start to see some of that additional commercial growth and utilization rates pick up, which would be a much better option for us as far as using some of that excess liquidity. 
On the loan side that we are seeing some tightening from the competitive perspective on the commercial side that, as you might imagine, there's stronger demand coming from banks to provide those loans. And so we are seeing a little bit tightening there compared to where we were a year ago. And on the consumer side, spreads on a curve adjusted basis continue to be pretty good for us. The both Laurel Road and residential mortgage are wider spreads than where they would typically be, even though the yields are still low compared to where we might want to see that overall portfolio but generally holding up pretty well."

We would expect very incremental changes as far as deploying some of those that initially, the liquidity will be absorbed through additional loan balances. And so as we mentioned before, we expect the first quarter to be the low point for us for average loan balances for the year, and that's really led by the consumer growth initially. And then we would expect to see line utilization rates pick up in the second half of the year for commercial. 
And so that will be helpful. And then as far as the investment portfolio that over the last couple of quarters, we put to work a net, say, $2 billion to $3 billion of additional investments outside of the treasury portfolio. And so I would think that, that would be an expected pace of maybe deploying $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter as far as shifting out of cash and putting that into the investment portfolio in addition to the loan growth."

Joining me on the call today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.  
On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosures and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.  
I'm now turning to Slide 3. Our first quarter was a strong start to the year as we executed our strategy and delivered positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago period. We continued to grow the number of clients across our franchise. In the first quarter, we experienced the strongest growth in consumer households in 5 years.  Additionally, we continue to add commercial clients and deepen existing relationships. We leverage the strength of our business model by raising over $13 billion for our commercial clients of which we retained approximately 19% on our balance sheet.  And let me just say that's exactly the way our model is designed to work, taking advantage of attractive markets for the benefit of our clients while maintaining our credit discipline with that which we place on our balance sheet.  
We also launched our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors at the end of March. I will comment more on that shortly. In addition, we announced the acquisition of AQN Strategies, a client-focused analytics firm with deep expertise in the financial services industry.  The acquisition aligns to Key's relationship strategy and underscores our commitment to a data-driven approach to grow our business. We also identified 70 branches for consolidation representing approximately 7% of our network. We continue to lean into digital. Most of these closures will take place in the second quarter.  
Moving to our financial results for the quarter. We reported net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter. On a per share basis, this is an increase of 9% from the fourth quarter results and up significantly from the year ago period.  We generated record first quarter revenue, which reflected broad-based growth across our company, driven by our fee-based businesses. Our Investment Banking business achieved record first quarter revenues with growth across the platform.
This is an area where we have invested in our teammates and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including such areas as health care and technology.  We have grown this business in 8 of the last 9 years, including having a record year in 2020, and we expect to grow this business again in 2021. We reached a new milestone in our consumer mortgage business with record loan originations of $3 billion for the quarter.  In addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year ago period. Our outlook for this business remains positive as we continue to grow and take market share. We reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we expect to eclipse that level this year. Other contributors to fee income this quarter were trust and investment services and cards and payments income. 
Credit quality remains strong. Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter.  We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through the business cycle.  Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. Our strong capital position enables us to execute against our capital priorities, organic growth, dividends and share repurchases.  This quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares. Our Board of Directors also approved our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.185 a share.  
Now turning to Slide 4. Before I turn the call over to Don, I wanted to make a few comments regarding Laurel Road. We acquired Laurel Road, a born digital company in April of 2019. The acquisition has exceeded all of our expectations. It has accelerated our digital transformation and has been a great complement to our existing health care platform. Since our acquisition, Laurel Road has generated over $4.6 billion in high-quality loan originations adding high-value digital relationships with health care professionals. We also have the opportunity to continue to scale this business. At the end of March, we took the next step on this journey with the launch of our Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, serving the health care segment and expanding our consumer franchise nationally.  
Importantly, our approach to our Digital Bank is differentiated. Historically, many offerings have been product-centric or focused on deposit gathering. Ours is a fully -- is fully aligned with our relationship strategy. The launch broadened our offering for Laurel Road clients to include deposits, additional lending products and other value-added services created to meet the unique financial needs of health care professionals.  The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, health care and primacy. Right now, we are focused on physicians and dentists, but soon, we will expand to other medical professionals.  Importantly, this launch is not the end goal, but rather just the beginning.  
I will close my remarks by restating that I am pleased with our results for the quarter and our strong start for 2021. I am proud of what we have achieved as a team and remain optimistic about the future as we emerge from the pandemic and the economy continues to recover.  Key is well positioned to grow and deliver on our commitments for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to now turn it over to Don to walk through the quarter. Don?"
329376,703000146,2253834,"KeyCorp, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","KeyCorp","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I'm now on Slide 6.

As Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over 4x from the year ago period.  The quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. The reserve release was largely driven by expected improvement in the economic environment. Importantly, we generated a record first quarter revenue, driven by the strength in our fee-based businesses.  I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation.  
Turning to Slide 7. Total average loans were $101 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflected Key's participation in PPP, partially offset by decreased utilization. PPP loans had an impact of $7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 average balances. Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter.  
The investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships. Linked quarter average loan balances were down 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances. We had just under $1 billion of PPP forgiveness in the current quarter.  Consumer loans were up 1% from the prior quarter, again related to continued production from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.  
Continuing on to Slide 8. Average deposits totaled $138 billion for the first quarter of 2021, up $28 billion or 25% compared to the year ago period and up 1.5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year-ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus. The growth was offset by continued and expected decline in time deposits. The interest-bearing deposit costs came down another 3 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020, following an 8 basis point decline last quarter.  We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.  
Turning to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.012 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $989 million a year ago and $1.043 billion for the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.61% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 3.01% for the same period last year and 2.7% from the prior quarter.  Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.  
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income decreased $31 million and the margin declined 9 basis points. The decrease in net interest income was caused by the day count of approximately $14 million, lower loan fees of $8 million and lower loan balances resulting in an additional $8 million reduction to NII.  Net interest margin also reflected a 4 basis point reduction due to the increases in our liquidity position.  
Moving on to Slide 10. We have continued to see growth in our fee-based businesses. Noninterest income was $738 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $477 million for the year ago period and $802 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 55%.  We had a record first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $162 million driven by broad-based strength across the platform. This quarter, both debt and equity markets were especially strong. Record mortgage originations drove mortgage -- consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $27 million or 135% from the first quarter of '20. Cards and payments income also increased $39 million related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs as well as the growth in the core platform.  
Other income in the year ago period included $92 million of market-related valuation adjustments. Compared to the fourth quarter, noninterest income decreased by $64 million. Largest driver of the quarterly decrease was seasonality in our investment banking line coming off an all-time high record quarter. This was partially offset by the strength in trust and investment services income and cards and payments income.  
I'm now on Slide 11. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.071 billion compared to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation, which increased $58 million and the increase in our stock price resulting in a $36 million increase compared to last year.  Employee benefit costs also increased $15 million. 
Year-over-year, payments-related costs reported in other expense were $32 million higher, driven by higher prepaid activity. Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform, accounting changes and timing differences. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense decreased $57 million. The decline was largely due to lower production-related incentives and severance costs.  
Moving now to Slide 12. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the first quarter, net charge-offs were $114 million or 46 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $93 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production.  Nonperforming loans were $728 million this quarter or 72 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of almost $60 million from the prior quarter. Additionally, criticized loans declined and the 30- to 90-day delinquencies also improved again quarter-over-quarter with a 5 basis point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remain relatively flat.  
Now on to Slide 13. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the first quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%.  This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities.  Our Board of Directors approved a first quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. We also repurchased $135 million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in January of up to $900 million. This leaves us with a capacity of up to $765 million for the next 2 quarters.  
On Slide 14, we provide our full year 2021 outlook, which we've adjusted to reflect our strong start to the year, positive momentum in our business and more favorable revenue outlook. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year. Average loans are expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of PPP and stronger commercial growth in the second half of the year.  The first quarter should be the low point of the year with expected growth from here. We expect deposits to be up mid-single digits and that we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base.  
Net interest income should be up low single digits. Our net interest income will benefit from higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates.  Noninterest income should be up mid-single digits, reflecting the growth in most of our core fee-based businesses. Noninterest expense should be relatively stable, reflecting higher production-based incentives related to our improved revenue outlook. Our continuous improvement efforts and branch consolidation plans remain on track and will help support our ongoing investments in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings.  
Moving on to credit quality. We have reduced our net charge-off guidance, which is now expected to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range for the year. This reflects the quality of our portfolio and our current outlook. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at around 19% for the year.  
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns.  Overall, it was a good start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.

On the consumer side, we had a record year in terms -- a record quarter, I beg your pardon, in terms of number of new households. We also had a record quarter in terms of mortgage originations at $3 billion. So we have a lot of trajectory on the consumer side. The consumer is spending.  And while you don't see it in credit card balances because at origination, our average consumer has a FICO score of around 770, What you do see it in is the velocity in both debit and credit. We believe that our growth engines in consumer -- last year, we generated about $10 billion of originations between Laurel Road and mortgage, we think we will do more than that this year. And that trajectory is -- they're up and running.  
Let's talk about commercial a little bit, which is clearly delayed. First of all, commercial right now, we have really unprecedented utilization as in low utilization. So I think one of the areas where we can grow from a commercial perspective is as there are supply chain challenges, as there is clearly some inflation out there.  I think you'll see people start to build their inventory. And I would suspect we'll see utilization improve from the low point that it is now. As I mentioned, there's a lot of strategic discussions going on that should generate loan growth. What we're not seeing right now is investment in people and property, plant and equipment. And I would guess on the people front, one of the challenges for our customers is it's hard to hire people. So that's one of the challenges. But on property, plant and equipment, I would expect that to ramp up in the second half. These projects, as you know, take a fair amount of lead time. So consumer, strong throughout the year. I think commercial is going to be relatively flat in the first half and will pick up in the second half."

And just using the midpoint, net interest income is up about $80 million. And roughly $45 million to $50 million of that is coming from the improved rate outlook that we've seen with the rate curve moving up and just the impact of that in the overall portfolio.  If you take a look at the loan balances overall that I would say that they're up very modestly, but it really shows a little bit more of a mix improvement there as far as the yield impact. As Chris highlighted, that we had record mortgage originations of $3 billion this past quarter. We've increased our outlook as far as the overall mortgage balances going onto the balance sheet and pull back a little bit on the commercial given the lower utilization rates we saw in the first quarter.  
And so that mix shift also helped a little bit. As far as PPP, we talked on the call in January about we thought that with the new loans that we'd be seeing coming through with the current wave of PPP, if you take a look at the net interest income, which includes both the 1% interest plus the fee income, we thought that'd be up about $80 million year-over-year. And that's about the same as what we're seeing this year as far as our outlook in April and so we're still seeing that kind of an incremental benefit. And then as far as the forgiveness, we would expect of last year's production of the $8 billion about 85% of that to be forgiven throughout the remainder of this year. And so we will see that acceleration occur as far as some of the fee income in future quarters compared to what we experienced in the first quarter. But generally fairly consistent with what we would have expected back in January."

And as we mentioned earlier, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter one of the drivers of why our NII was down was about $8 million lower loan fees and some of that was related to the PPP because we had higher levels of forgiveness in the fourth quarter than what we actually did in the first quarter of this year.  
And so as far as the PPP impact, we would expect that the total NII level contributed for first quarter versus the rest of the year to continue to trend down a little bit, very modestly at first and thinking of $1 million or $2 million a quarter coming from that just with the impact of the forgiveness of those loans. But generally, again, fairly consistent with what we would have expected coming into the year as far as the trajectory and our outlook for those balances."

As far as our securities portfolio that we did add to both the core book as well as a short-term treasury book. We've got as of the end of the period, about a $5 billion over the last 2 quarters increase in the core bond portfolio. That was really done in some of the core type of products and investments we would normally invest in, which would include CMOs and 15-year pass-throughs. We also did some commercial mortgage agency securities as well and attached swaps to those so that basically it locks in that fixed rate for the first, say, 4 to 6 years and then converts it to a nice loading rate for us. And so the average yield on those purchases was around $140 million. The roll-off of our existing portfolio is around a $2.35 to $2.40 range. And so we do see continued pressure there based on where the  current rates are, but is just consistent with what we're seeing in the markets overall. 
As far as that short-term treasury portion of the portfolio, we added again, about $5 billion also over the last 2 quarters. The average yield on that is about 40 basis points. And well, that's fairly low. It's a fairly short duration of the portfolio and really is just representing a safe substitute for the cash position as we're continuing to maintain cash levels of about $15 billion, which is from our target level of about $1 billion and no more than $2 billion. 
And so just something we'll continue to evaluate as far as the overall outlook as far as putting some of those additional dollars to work. And hopefully, we start to see some of that additional commercial growth and utilization rates pick up, which would be a much better option for us as far as using some of that excess liquidity. 
On the loan side that we are seeing some tightening from the competitive perspective on the commercial side that, as you might imagine, there's stronger demand coming from banks to provide those loans. And so we are seeing a little bit tightening there compared to where we were a year ago. And on the consumer side, spreads on a curve adjusted basis continue to be pretty good for us. The both Laurel Road and residential mortgage are wider spreads than where they would typically be, even though the yields are still low compared to where we might want to see that overall portfolio but generally holding up pretty well."

The most recent one, obviously, was just last quarter when we purchased AQN, which is an analytics business. 
But there are clearly opportunities with our targeted scale for us to go out and acquire these entrepreneurial companies that, by the way, are good companies that we're able to integrate, but they really bring a skill set to Key as well. With Laurel Road, I think we acquired 40 full stack software engineers, for example. And that clearly will be helpful as we advance our digital strategy throughout Key. So yes, there are opportunities, and we'll keep our eyes open for those."

We also saw a corresponding increase in our expenses of $32 million. And so near term, the benefit really is from those deposits that are being maintained there. And so we would expect those programs to continue to wind down throughout the year. And so we will see that cards and payments-related revenue line item coming down for that, but also see a corresponding impact on the expense side as well. 
As we mentioned earlier, we were starting to see in the first quarter some nice trends as far as the year-over-year growth rates in all of our card programs, whether it was consumer credit card or debit card or whether it was the commercial card products that we have. And so we're excited about that core momentum and probably would expect to see growth there on a core basis, but might be a little cloudy to see that as we would expect to see some of that prepaid balance or activity flow throughout the year."

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosures and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now moving to Slide 3. We delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.72. This is an increase of 18% from the first quarter and up significantly from the year ago period. Our results reflect our success in acquiring and deepening relationships across our franchise, further improvement in credit quality and contributions from targeted investments. We generated positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis and remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. 
We generated record second quarter revenue, driven by an 8% year-over-year increase in noninterest income. In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in new households in the first 6 months, in every one of our markets and in every age group. Importantly, some of our strongest growth has come from younger clients in the western part of our franchise. Our new client growth over the past 6 months exceeds our growth in any full year period over the last decade. 
Additionally, our consumer business generated over $4 billion in loan originations for the quarter. Mortgage originations reached another all-time high and we expect to exceed last year's record level of $8.3 billion for the full year. 
Laurel Road also had another strong quarter despite the federal student loan holiday. Since the launch of our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors, we have added over 2,500 new doctors and dentists. The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together several critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, health care and primacy. 
Moving to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our Investment Banking business generated fees of $217 million, a record second quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. We have grown this business consistently over the past decade, and we expect to grow it again in 2021. Importantly, this is a business driven primarily by repeat clients. Our pipelines are currently at record levels, supporting our strong growth outlook for the business. This quarter, we raised $21 billion for our clients, of which we retained approximately 20% on our balance sheet. 
Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make across our franchise, in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Let me highlight just a few of these investments. I've already mentioned Laurel Road and the launch of our National Digital Bank. Not only have we accelerated client acquisition, but our new clients are doing more with us with approximately half of our new doctor and dentist using multiple products. We also continued to build out our analytic capabilities, including our recent acquisition of AQN Strategies, we have doubled the size of our analytics team. 
Year-to-date, we have increased our senior bankers by 5% and in our targeted growth areas. This has resulted in a 21% increase in client pitches on a year-to-date basis. We also consolidated 54 branches this quarter with an additional 14 planned for next quarter. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support our ongoing investments. 
Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained positive this quarter. Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were 9 basis points. 
We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. Our strong capital position enables us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, namely organic growth, dividends and share repurchases. 
Combining our share repurchases and dividends paid this quarter, we have returned capital representing $0.50 a share for an annualized return of capital of approximately 11% at our current valuation. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The Board will also evaluate an increase to our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Overall, I was very pleased with the quarter, which reflects the hard work and dedication of our team. We grew our top line, and we made targeted investments to position the company for continued growth. As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Don, who will provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?"

As Chris said, it was a strong quarter with net income from continuing operations of $0.72 per common share, up 18% from the prior quarter and 4x from the year ago period. The quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. The reserve release was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and expected improvement in the economic environment. Importantly, we generated record second quarter revenue, driven by strength in our fee-based businesses. Our reported return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 22.3%. Adjusting for the reserve release, our ROTCE was 16% within our targeted range of 16% to 19%. I will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 6. Total average loans were $101 billion, down 7% from the second quarter of last year. C&I loans were down $9 billion, reflecting decreased utilization levels. Consumer loans were up 9%, benefiting from continued growth from Laurel Road and, as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business. Combined, we had over $4 billion of originations this quarter between our residential mortgage and Laurel Road production. The investments we've made in these areas continue to drive results and, importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships. 
Linked quarter average loan balances were relatively flat as commercial loans declined due to the commercial utilization rates, partly offset by growth in PPP loans. Consumer loans grew 2%, again related to the continued strength from our consumer mortgage and Laurel Road. 
PPP average balances were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up from $7 billion in the first quarter. The PPP balances ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, reflecting $2.8 billion of forgiveness and $900 million of new production. 
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $144 billion for the second quarter of 2021, up $16 billion or 13% compared to the year ago period. and up 5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus. The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing costs came down another 2 basis points from the first quarter, following a 3 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.023 billion for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.025 billion a year ago and $1.012 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.52% for the second quarter compared to 2.76% from the same period last year and 2.61% for the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $11 million and the margin declined 9 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness were offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. For the quarter, PPP loan fees, including the impact of forgiveness, totaled $50 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter. 
The significant build in liquidity continues to be the largest driver of our net interest margin. We are maintaining around $20 billion in excess cash. Cumulatively, excess liquidity has negatively impacted our net interest margin by about 35 basis points with 7 basis points of incremental impact for the second quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9. We've continued to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from the investments we've made. Noninterest income was $750 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $692 million for the year ago period and $738 million in the first quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 8%. We had a record second quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $217 million driven by a broad base across the platform, including strong M&A fees. Commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $32 million. Cards and payments income also increased $22 million related to broad-based growth across product categories, including debit, credit and merchant products. This growth was offset by lower consumer mortgage fees resulting from lower gains on sale margin and also the impact of MSR valuation changes. Lower operating lease income resulted from leverage lease gains in the year ago period. 
Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income increased by $12 million. The largest driver of the quarterly increase was a record second quarter and the second highest ever quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees. Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial mortgage servicing income also showed strength versus the prior quarter. These were partially offset by lower other income due to positive market-related valuation adjustments in the prior period, offset by negative adjustments in the current quarter. 
I'm now on Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.076 billion compared to $1.013 billion last year and $1.071 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect production-related incentives and the investments we've made to drive future growth. We have highlighted some of the significant investments on the lower left of this slide. We continue to invest in Laurel Road, including the launch of the National Digital Bank, including spend in marketing and technology. We also grew senior relationship bankers by 5% year-to-date in our targeted focus areas, including renewables team that we added in May. 
We've also continued to invest in our digital capabilities as well as analytics. Our analytics team has grown by 2.5x, including our recent acquisition of AQN. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation and an increase in our stock price. Employee benefit costs also increased [ $6 ] million as health care-related costs were low in the second quarter of last year. 
Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense was relatively stable. Higher incentive and stock-based compensation was offset by seasonally lower employee benefit cost. Marketing costs were up $5 million, primarily related to the launch of the Laurel Road for doctors. 
I'm now on Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the second quarter, net charge-offs were $22 million or 9 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $222 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy. Nonperforming loans were $694 million this quarter or 69 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $34 million from the prior quarter. Additionally, criticized loans declined and the over 90-day delinquencies improved quarter-over-quarter. 
Now on to Slide 12. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the second quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $300 million of common shares during the quarter, and our Board of Directors authorized a second quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. As Chris mentioned, combined, this return of capital represents $0.50 a share this quarter an annualized return of 11% of our current valuation. 
Earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continue through the third quarter of 2022. The Board will also evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
On Slide 13, we provide our updated full year 2021 outlook, which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage this year. Average loans are still expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of the PPP program and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this year. We expect deposits to be up high single digits, reflecting the continued outperformance we have seen to date. We will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base. 
Net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable, reflecting a low rate environment as well as the slightly lower-than-expected loan balances. Our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact of excess liquidity on our balance sheet. Noninterest income should be now up in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, reflecting the broad-based growth in most of our core fee-based businesses, including what is expected to be another record year for our investment banking business. 
Given the stronger revenue outlook, we now expect noninterest expense to be up low single digits, with the primary driver being higher production-related incentives. As we identified on our expense side, we are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth, namely teammates, technology and also rolling out new capabilities such as Laurel Road.  does not change our focus on core expenses and driving further efficiencies, including our commitment to generate positive operating leverage for the year. 
Moving to credit quality. We have reduced our net charge-off guidance once again, which is now expected to be in the 20 to 30 basis point range for the year. This reflects the quality of our portfolio, our current outlook and performance to date. And our guidance for the GAAP tax rate has increased to 20% for the full year, reflecting the higher expected earnings for this year. 
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our shareholders.

The other part of your question about what gives us comfort that we'll be able to have C&I growth in the back half. And you're right. We're guiding to relatively stable loans throughout 2021. Our consumer business will be the growth engine. But kind of the green shoot, so to speak, that we see in C&I are sort of as follows: Leasing, which we think is a leading indicator, our pipelines are up 35% year-over-year. And for us, Scott, as you know, that's typically around renewables, technology and health care, which are some of our focus areas. 
Other things that I think will help us is our focus on both technology and health care and also our subspecialties in renewables and affordable housing. And then lastly, the only other thing I would add is our M&A pipeline is at record levels, and that generally pulls through financings as well. That's kind of how we're thinking about it."

We also have about $5 billion worth of short-dated treasuries in our bond portfolio as well. And so -- we do have plenty of excess liquidity. We would typically target, say, between $1 billion and $2 billion of liquidity from that perspective. And so even if we turned around and invest it in today's rate environment, it would be a meaningful lift. In the second quarter, we bought about $2.2 billion worth of securities that had an average yield of [ 141 ] Today's market environment would still have in that, say, [ 125, 130 ] range for the same type of securities. And -- so if you look at a $20 billion of excess liquidity and apply that kind of a yield to it, it would be a lift of over $200 million, probably close to $250 million as far as the added revenues compared to where we would be today. And so that is meaningful. 
That being said, we're still looking for opportunities to when we start to invest. We've been more holding water as far as replacing some of the runoff with new purchases. But we do expect rates over the next several quarters to start picking up again and giving us some opportunities to buy there. 
On the hedge or swap portfolio that you might have seen in the slide deck that we actually terminated the swaps that were maturing throughout 2021. And so the value of the swap -- the notional value of the swap book has actually declined. We're not looking to add additional swaps there, but we'll continue to assess that and just assessing the overall asset sensitivity. Right now, we don't have a whole lot of downside risk because if rates -- even if they do go below 0, we have a lot of floors in place in some of our commercial portfolios.

And even adjusting for that, our net charge-offs would have been 17 basis points for the quarter. So still very low absent that on recovery. 
If you look at the CECL reserves that we have that I think your math is pretty close to where we would see it as well is that while the economic outlook is probably stronger on a relative basis as far as improvements from here. I would say that if you look at the underlying nature of the portfolio, we still have a little bit higher level of criticized classified loans today than what we did with -- as of January 1 of last year. And so it would suggest that we should have a higher level of reserve. 
That being said, we've continued to increase our qualitative component to the reserve. And so if you look at the qualitative component along with certain model overlays, it's about 25% of the total reserve. So it's higher than what we would have expected in a CECL world to deploy. And it's just given some of the uncertainty as to how things will continue to evolve from here, and could allow the opportunity to see some further reserve releases. Now I don't want to set the expectation that we're going to have another $220 million negative provision expense or reserve recapture in the near quarter -- near-term quarters, but we do expect to see that reserve level probably continue to trend down from here to reflect the current status of our loan quality and the economic outlook that we're seeing in front of us."

And then another component that will impact us is the PPP forgiveness, which had elevated levels here in the second quarter, and would expect to see that come down in future quarters. 
As far as the impact for both security purchases and also for fixed rate loans that an example would be in the second quarter, we had about $2.2 billion of runoff, and it had an average rate on that of [ 226 ] and the average purchase yield for the same $2.2 billion we bought during the quarter was [ 1.4 ] So about 80 basis points of compression on that specific asset class. We would also expect to see fixed rate loans, which isn't as large for us as it probably is for other peers have somewhere in that 60 to 80 basis points of compression there as well for the rollover of those assets as well."

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosures and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I'm now moving to Slide 3. We delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.72. This is an increase of 18% from the first quarter and up significantly from the year ago period. Our results reflect our success in acquiring and deepening relationships across our franchise, further improvement in credit quality and contributions from targeted investments. We generated positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis and remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year.
We generated record second quarter revenue, driven by an 8% year-over-year increase in noninterest income. In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in new households in the first 6 months. In every one of our markets and in every age group, importantly, some of our strongest growth has come from younger clients in the western part of our franchise. Our new client growth over the past 6 months exceeds our growth in any full year period over the last decade.
Additionally, our consumer business generated over $4 billion in loan originations for the quarter. Mortgage originations reached another all-time high and we expect to exceed last year's record level of $8.3 billion for the full year.
Laurel Road also had another strong quarter despite the federal student loan holiday. Since the launch of our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, we have added over 2,500 new doctors and dentists. The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together several critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, health care and primacy.
Moving to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our investment banking business generated fees of $217 million, a record second quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. We have grown this business consistently over the past decade, and we expect to grow it again in 2021. Importantly, this is a business driven primarily by repeat clients. Our pipelines are currently at record levels, supporting our strong growth outlook for the business. This quarter, we raised $21 billion for our clients, of which we retained approximately 20% on our balance sheet.
Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make across our franchise, in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Let me highlight just a few of these investments. I've already mentioned Laurel Road and the launch of our National Digital Bank. Not only have we accelerated client acquisition, but our new clients are doing more with us with approximately half of our new doctor and dentists using multiple products. We also continued to build out our analytic capabilities, including our recent acquisition of AQN Strategies, we have doubled the size of our analytics team.
Year-to-date, we have increased our senior bankers by 5% in our targeted growth areas. This has resulted in a 21% increase in client pitches on a year-to-date basis. We also consolidated 54 branches this quarter with an additional 14 planned for next quarter. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support our ongoing investments.
Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained positive this quarter. Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were 9 basis points.
We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. Our strong capital position enables us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, namely organic growth, dividends and share repurchases.
Combining our share repurchases and dividends paid this quarter, we have returned capital representing $0.50 a share for an annualized return of capital of approximately 11% at our current valuation. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The Board will also evaluate an increase to our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Overall, I was very pleased with the quarter, which reflects the hard work and dedication of our team. We grew our top line, and we made targeted investments to position the company for continued growth. As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
I will now turn the call over to Don, who will provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?"

As Chris said, it was a strong quarter with net income from continuing operations of $0.72 per common share, up 18% from the prior quarter and 4x from the year ago period. The quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. The reserve release was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and expected improvement in the economic environment. Importantly, we generated record second quarter revenue, driven by strength in our fee-based businesses. Our reported return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 22.3%. Adjusting for the reserve release, our ROTCE was 16% within our targeted range of 16% to 19%. I will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation.
Turning to Slide 6. Total average loans were $101 billion, down 7% from the second quarter of last year. C&I loans were down $9 billion, reflecting decreased utilization levels. Consumer loans were up 9%, benefiting from continued growth from Laurel Road and, as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business. Combined, we had over $4 billion of originations this quarter between our residential mortgage and Laurel Road production. The investments we've made in these areas continue to drive results and, importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships.
Linked quarter average loan balances were relatively flat as commercial loans declined due to the commercial utilization rates, partly offset by growth in PPP loans. Consumer loans grew 2%, again related to the continued strength from our consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.
PPP average balances were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up from $7 billion in the first quarter. The PPP balances ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, reflecting $2.8 billion of forgiveness and $900 million of new production.
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $144 billion for the second quarter of 2021, up $16 billion or 13% compared to the year ago period. and up 5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus. The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing costs came down another 2 basis points from the first quarter, following a 3 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.023 billion for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $1.025 billion a year ago and $1.012 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.52% for the second quarter compared to 2.76% from the same period last year and 2.61% for the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $11 million and the margin declined 9 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness were offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. For the quarter, PPP loan fees, including the impact of forgiveness, totaled $50 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter.
The significant build in liquidity continues to be the largest driver of our net interest margin. We are maintaining around $20 billion in excess cash. Cumulatively, excess liquidity has negatively impacted our net interest margin by about 35 basis points with 7 basis points of incremental impact for the second quarter.
Moving to Slide 9. We've continued to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from the investments we've made. Noninterest income was $750 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $692 million for the year ago period and $738 million in the first quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 8%. We had a record second quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $217 million driven by a broad-based growth across the platform, including strong M&A fees. Commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $32 million. Cards and payments income also increased $22 million related to broad-based growth across product categories, including debit, credit and merchant products. This growth was offset by lower consumer mortgage fees resulting from lower gains on sale margin and also the impact of MSR valuation changes. Lower operating lease income resulted from leverage lease gains in the year ago period.
Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income increased by $12 million. The largest driver of the quarterly increase was a record second quarter and the second highest ever quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees. Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial mortgage servicing income also showed strength versus the prior quarter. These were partially offset by lower other income due to positive market-related valuation adjustments in the prior period, offset by negative adjustments in the current quarter.
I'm now on Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.076 billion compared to $1.013 billion last year and $1.071 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect production-related incentives and the investments we've made to drive future growth. We have highlighted some of the significant investments on the lower left of this slide. We continue to invest in Laurel Road, including the launch of the National Digital Bank, including spend in marketing and technology. We also grew senior relationship bankers by 5% year-to-date in our targeted focus areas, including renewables team that we added in May.
We've also continued to invest in our digital capabilities as well as analytics. Our analytics team has grown by 2.5x, including our recent acquisition of AQN. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation and an increase in our stock price. Employee benefit costs also increased $16 million as health care-related costs were low in the second quarter of last year.
Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense was relatively stable. Higher incentive and stock-based compensation was offset by seasonally lower employee benefit cost. Marketing costs were up $5 million, primarily related to the launch of the Laurel Road for Doctors.
I'm now on Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the second quarter, net charge-offs were $22 million or 9 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $222 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy. Nonperforming loans were $694 million this quarter or 69 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $34 million from the prior quarter. Additionally, criticized loans declined and the over 90-day delinquencies improved quarter-over-quarter.
Now on to Slide 12. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the second quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $300 million of common shares during the quarter, and our Board of Directors authorized a second quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. As Chris mentioned, combined, this return of capital represents $0.50 a share this quarter, an annualized return of 11% of our current valuation.
Earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The Board will also evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.
On Slide 13, we provide our updated full year 2021 outlook, which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage this year. Average loans are still expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of the PPP program and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this year. We expect deposits to be up high single digits, reflecting the continued outperformance we have seen to date. We will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base.
Net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable, reflecting the low rate environment as well as the slightly lower-than-expected loan balances. Our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact of excess liquidity on our balance sheet. Noninterest income should be now up in the high single digit to low double-digit range, reflecting the broad-based growth in most of our core fee-based businesses, including what is expected to be another record year for our investment banking business.
Given the stronger revenue outlook, we now expect noninterest expense to be up low single digits, with the primary driver being higher production-related incentives. As we identified on our expense side, we are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth, namely teammates, technology and also rolling out new capabilities such as Laurel Road. Does not change our focus on core expenses and driving further efficiencies, including our commitment to generate positive operating leverage for the year.
Moving to credit quality. We have reduced our net charge-off guidance once again, which is now expected to be in the 20 to 30 basis point range for the year. This reflects the quality of our portfolio, our current outlook and performance to date. And our guidance for the GAAP tax rate has increased to 20% for the full year, reflecting the higher expected earnings for this year.
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our shareholders.

So kind of as you think about -- we always look at revolver utilization in the C&I space. And -- so typically, for us, it's been mid-30s for a long time. It would have peaked last year at 40 when people were drawing on their lines, like that",250,"Sure, Scott. So kind of as you think about -- we always look at revolver utilization in the C&I space. And -- so typically, for us, it's been mid-30s for a long time.

Now the good news is that it has stabilized at 27. And as we look at kind of some of the metrics, we think we've stabilized at 27.
The other part of your question about what gives us comfort that we'll be able to have C&I growth in the back half. And you're right. We're guiding to relatively stable loans throughout 2021. Our consumer business will be the growth engine. But kind of the green shoot, so to speak, that we see in C&I are sort of as follows: Leasing, which we think is a leading indicator, our pipelines are up 35% year-over-year. And for us, Scott, as you know, that's typically around renewables, technology and health care, which are some of our focus areas.
Other things that I think will help us is our focus on both technology and health care and also our subspecialties in renewables and affordable housing. And then lastly, the only other thing I would add is our M&A pipeline is at record levels, and that generally pulls through financings as well. That's kind of how we're thinking about it."

We would typically target, say, between $1 billion and $2 billion of liquidity from that perspective. And so even if we turned around and invest it in today's rate environment, it would be a meaningful lift. In the second quarter, we bought about $2.2 billion worth of securities that had an average yield of 1.41. Today's market environment would still have in that, say, 1.25, 1.30 range for the same type of securities. And -- so if you look at $20 billion of excess liquidity and apply that kind of a yield to it, it would be a lift of over $200 million, probably close to $250 million as far as the added revenues compared to where we would be today. And so that is meaningful.
That being said, we're still looking for opportunities to when we start to invest. We've been more holding water as far as replacing some of the runoff with new purchases. But we do expect rates over the next several quarters to start picking up again and giving us some opportunities to buy there.
On the hedge or swap portfolio that you might have seen in the slide deck, we actually terminated swaps that were maturing throughout 2021. And so the value of the swap -- the notional value of the swap book has actually declined. We're not looking to add additional swaps there, but we'll continue to assess that and just assessing the overall asset sensitivity. Right now, we don't have a whole lot of downside risk because if rates -- even if they do go below 0, we have a lot of floors in place in some of our commercial portfolios.

And even adjusting for that, our net charge-offs would have been 17 basis points for the quarter. So still very low absent that one recovery.
If you look at the CECL reserves that we have, that I think your math is pretty close to where we would see it as well is that while the economic outlook is probably stronger on a relative basis as far as improvements from here, I would say that if you look at the underlying nature of the portfolio, we still have a little bit higher level of criticized classified loans today than what we did as of January 1 of last year. And so it would suggest that we should have a higher level of reserve.
That being said, we've continued to increase our qualitative component to the reserve. And so if you look at the qualitative component along with certain model overlays, it's about 25% of the total reserve. So it's higher than what we would have expected in a CECL world to deploy. And it's just given some of the uncertainty as to how things will continue to evolve from here, and could allow the opportunity to see some further reserve releases. Now I don't want to set the expectation that we're going to have another $220 million negative provision expense or reserve recapture in the near quarter -- near-term quarters, but we do expect to see that reserve level probably continue to trend down from here to reflect the current status of our loan quality and the economic outlook that we're seeing in front of us."

As far as the impact for both security purchases and also for fixed rate loans that an example would be in the second quarter, we had about $2.2 billion of runoff, and it had an average rate on that of 2.26 and the average purchase yield for the same $2.2 billion we bought during the quarter was 1.4. So about 80 basis points of compression on that specific asset class. We would also expect to see fixed rate loans, which isn't as large for us as it probably is for other peers have somewhere in that 60 to 80 basis points of compression there as well for the rollover of those assets as well."

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now moving to Slide 3. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with net income of $616 million or $0.65 a share. We delivered positive operating leverage and expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year. We delivered record third quarter revenue, which was up 8% from the year ago period. 
Our results were driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Noninterest income reached a record third quarter level, up 17% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by broad-based growth across our fee-based businesses, including investment banking, which was up 61%. I am especially proud of the way our teammates continue to serve our communities and clients and in doing so, creating new and deeper relationships across our franchise. 
In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in net new households in the first 9 months of the year. Our Western franchise is growing at a rate of over 2x the rest of our footprint and younger clients continue to be our fastest-growing segment. Additionally, our consumer business generated a record $4.2 billion in loan originations for the quarter, which reflects growth from our consumer mortgage business and Laurel Road. Through the first 9 months of the year, our consumer mortgage originations have exceeded 2020's full year record level of $8.3 billion. 
Laurel Road had another strong quarter as we continue to add and expand high-quality relationships through our national digital bank. Importantly, what really sets Laurel Road apart is our targeted client approach, which results in high-value digital relationships nationally. Currently, 75% of our volume is coming from outside our footprint. Laurel Road is part of a broader health care initiative across our company that has established key as 1 of the leading health care banks. 
Moving on to our commercial businesses. we had another strong quarter. Our Investment Banking business generated fees of $235 million, a record third quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. Our broad and comprehensive platform has enabled this business to grow consistently over the past decade. 
Our Investment Banking business has grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years. We are on pace to generate double-digit growth again in 2021. Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make in our franchise in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Year-to-date, we consolidated 73 branches or approximately 7% of our branch network. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support ongoing investments. We will continue to look for opportunities to rightsize our footprint. 
Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained very strong this quarter. Nonperforming loans and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were 11 basis points. We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. 
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.6%, above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. In the third quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program facilitated by the capital relief from the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. The accelerated share repurchase program is part of our previously disclosed $1.5 billion share authorization. 
In total, we repurchased $593 million of common stock in the third quarter. Dividends also remain a priority. Our dividend remains above 3%. Our Board of Directors will consider a dividend increase at our meeting next month. 
I will close by restating that it was another strong quarter. We generated positive operating leverage by growing our top line and managing expenses while continuing to make investments for our future. As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Don, who will provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?"

For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.65 per common share. Our results reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses, which was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and positive economic outlook. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage this quarter. And as Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year. 
Total revenues were up 8% compared to the same period last year. We had year-over-year growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 18.6%. I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 6. There were 2 major items that impacted loan growth this quarter, PPP loans and the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. Average PPP loans declined $3.3 billion this quarter as we help clients take advantage of loan forgiveness. We also sold our indirect auto portfolio last month. The sale impacted our third quarter average results by approximately $800 million and $3.3 billion on an ending basis. Average loans were down from the year-ago period, reflecting the reduction in PPP balances and lower commercial line utilization. 
Compared to the prior quarter, average loans were down 0.7%. Adjusting for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio, our loans were up approximately $100 million on average and up over $1 billion on an ending basis. Adding to the comments on our core loan growth, adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and PPP loans our linked quarter total loan growth would have been 4.3%. We continued to see strong consumer loan growth driven by Laurel Road and consumer mortgage. On the commercial side, we were pleased to see a slight uptick in utilization. 
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $147 billion for the third quarter of 2021, up $12 billion or 9% compared to the year ago period and up 2% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances. The growth was partially offset by continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 1 basis point from the second quarter, following a 2 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately 60% of our total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.025 billion for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.006 billion a year ago and $1.023 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.47% for the third quarter '21 compared to 2.62% for the same period last year and 2.52% for the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to a year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. 
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $2 million and the margin declined 5 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and the benefit of the day count were partially offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. For the quarter, total loan fees from PPP loans were $45 million compared to $50 million last quarter. We've also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and our asset liability positioning. In the third quarter, our sensitivity to rising rates moved higher and we ended the period with over $25 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We continue to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from our ongoing investments. Noninterest income was $797 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $681 million for the year ago period and $750 million in the second quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 17%. We had a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $235 million driven by broad-based growth across the platform, including strong M&A fees. 
Additionally, corporate services income increased $18 million and commercial mortgage fees increased to $16 million. Offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees due to a lower gain on sale margin. Compared to the second quarter, noninterest income increased by $47 million. The largest driver of this quarterly increase was the record third quarter investment banking and debt placement fees. 
I'm now on Slide 10. We total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.112 billion compared to $1.037 billion last year and $1.076 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we have made to drive future growth. The increase from the year ago period primarily reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation attributed to our higher fee production and Keys increased stock price. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses was primarily driven by 2 areas: the first, personnel expense related to 1 additional day of salary expense in the quarter and slightly higher employee benefits; the second was an increase in other expense of $18 million, largely related pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions. 
Now moving to Slide 11. We Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the third quarter, net charge-offs were $29 million or 11 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs in the current quarter included $22 million related to the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $107 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production. Nonperforming loans were $554 million this quarter or 56 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $140 million or 20% from the prior quarter. 
Now on to Slide 12. We ended the third quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $593 million of common shares during the quarter our Board of Directors approved a third quarter dividend at $0.185 per common share. Of the $593 million in common share repurchases, million were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program, representing 80% of the $585 million authorization. The remaining $125 million were purchased in the open market. The remaining 20% of the ASR will be settled in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 13, similar to prior years, we provided guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Guidance ranges are listed at the bottom of the slide. Importantly, using midpoints of this outlook would buy PPNR is at or above our full year 2021 outlook provided last quarter. We have adjusted our guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance especially in our fee-based businesses as well as the continued strength in our credit quality. 
Average loans will be up low single digits, excluding the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. We expect continued growth in both our core commercial and consumer balances. Average deposits should remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is expected to be down low single digits, reflecting lower PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter and the impact of the auto loan sale. Noninterest come should be relatively stable off our record third quarter performance with momentum in most of our fee-based businesses through year-end. We will also benefit from what we expect to be another year for our investment banking business. We expect noninterest expense to be down low single digits in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to credit quality. We expect our net charge-offs to be below 20 basis points for the fourth quarter. Credit trends were strong in the third quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate has remained unchanged at 20%. 
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile in improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.

We're really proud of the fact that we have operating -- positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis. We will have positive operating leverage for the year 2021. We have not yet pulled together our plans for 2022. We will share that guidance with everybody in our January call. But I can tell you, positive operating leverage is a very important part of how we run the business. It's a huge area of focus when we have all of our business leaders in, we're investing heavily in these businesses, but we have to be able to get the growth for the investment. And to date, obviously, we're getting that, but we'll continue to focus on positive operating leverage. 
You mentioned inflationary pressures. I don't think there's any question that there's inflationary pressures in the financial services industry. And within our customer base, we clearly are seeing those. And those will be a challenge, I think, for everyone in the economy."

And that's something we challenge all the time that you might see from the materials that this quarter, we had some activity in our bond portfolio with purchases of traditional core investments of about $3.7 billion compared to runoff of $2.1 billion that we saw from the cash flows off the existing portfolio. 
In addition to that, we bought some short-term treasuries of about $4 billion and also the auto securitization transaction ended up increasing our overall bond portfolio by $2.8 billion as well. And so we ended the quarter at about $49 billion of total investments, which is up from the average of $43 billion. 
What I would say is that we've seen a nice tick up in rates that the purchases we made in the third quarter had an average yield of 135. Those same types of investments at the start of the fourth quarter and the 150 to 160 range. So that would probably give us some opportunity to lean a little heavier into portfolio purchases in the fourth quarter and beyond, and we'll continue to assess that. 
We're sitting right now on $25 billion of excess liquidity compared with cash positions and short-term treasuries, and we do plan to put that to work over time. And probably see a clip of something in that $4 billion to $5 billion range near term instead of the $3.7 billion that we purchased in the third quarter and maybe moving that up as we get more and more comfortable with where rates are positioned for the long term."

We're now in our -- we talk about a 6% asset-sensitive position in our slide deck, and that's higher where it would be traditionally. But also available to us going forward in the next year is the redeployment of liquidity. So some of that will be taking out the cash position, which is a variable rate asset, low earnings variable rate asset, but still variable rate and replacing it with long-dated investment securities, and we typically have about a 4-year average life or for those securities. 
And so we'll have to take that in consideration as to whether or not we just do more of that or we do additional replacements of the swaps. Right now, we've not been replacing any of the swap maturities and we'll continue to reassess that going forward. So that's just generally how we would manage the overall asset sensitivity position of the company. 
As far as the benefit from the swaps in the third quarter, we had about $76 million of net interest income coming from the swaps. We could see that come down slightly over the next couple of quarters. And then the question will be going forward is what happens with rates. And as the short-term rates move up, you would see that number come down, but we would have seen an offsetting impact from the rates on the commercial loans going up, benefiting from those higher rates.

If we added on the impact of the PPP forgiveness and loan balance expectations there, that would add another $1.8 billion to the overall loan growth. So almost 2%, so that would take it from a in digit to a mid-single-digit kind of growth expectation on a linked quarter basis. 
And so something similar to what we reported essentially this quarter. As far as the NII outlook, I would say that there's 2 things that are impacting NII outlook for the fourth quarter, you hit on one, which is PPP. And we would expect probably in the neighborhood of a $10 million or so type of decline in PPP revenues. The other is the indirect auto loan sale that as a result of the sale, our net interest income will be down, but our fee income will be up. We essentially received 75 basis points for servicing those loans. And so you will see a decline in NII of about $10 million and an increase of fee income in the range of $5 million to help offset that. And those are kind of the moving parts and pieces."

It's also clearly contributed to our thinking as we developed our technology road map. 
We are clearly tied into the entire fintech ecosystem. And our unique strategy is both known and understood by the fintech community, which is helpful. Going to your question of how many relationships we have, I would say, today, we have probably 10 client-facing relationships we literally have tens of infrastructure relationships with fintechs because we're sort of known in the whole ecosystem, we see a lot, maybe 15 or 20 opportunities every single month that we kind of sort through kind of if you step back and take a look and think about kind of from a strategic perspective, our targeted scale strategy, it just makes us a great partner because we have such distinct client groups. And obviously, as you're developing software, that's really helpful. 
What we have done at Key is in Laurel Road as we've built this national digital affinity Bank, which is a relationship approach to digital banking.

One is as far as our overall credit quality position, for many of the metrics today, we're actually better than what we were pre-pandemic. So if you look at nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, the delinquency stats for consumer and commercial loans are all better than where they were pre-pandemic. 
Our criticized and classified are a little higher than what they were before the pandemic, but coming down dramatically. And we've seen incremental improvements this quarter that are outpacing what we've seen before that. And so that would suggest that things are going to be good for some time. But at the same time, I would think that you're probably going to see the consumers start to turn a little sooner. They've been the beneficiary of so much stimulus. And if that starts to slow and go away like we would expect it to, you would start to see some of that start to return to more normal levels over time as well. 
And then the commercial customer, while it's still flushed with liquidity, but we just aren't seeing the early signs of that there's going to be some challenges down the road. And so I think that we're going to be in a period for some time where we're going to see charge-offs below the low end of guidance ranges across the industry."

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now moving to Slide 3. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with net income of $616 million or $0.65 a share. We delivered positive operating leverage and expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year. We delivered record third quarter revenue, which was up 8% from the year ago period. 
Our results were driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Noninterest income reached a record third quarter level, up 17% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by broad-based growth across our fee-based businesses, including investment banking, which was up 61%. I am especially proud of the way our teammates continue to serve our communities and clients and in doing so, creating new and deeper relationships across our franchise. 
In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in net new households in the first 9 months of the year. Our Western franchise is growing at a rate of over 2x the rest of our footprint and younger clients continue to be our fastest-growing segment. 
Additionally, our consumer business generated a record $4.2 billion in loan originations for the quarter, which reflects growth from our consumer mortgage business and Laurel Road. Through the first 9 months of the year, our consumer mortgage originations have exceeded 2020's full year record level of $8.3 billion. 
Laurel Road had another strong quarter as we continue to add and expand high-quality relationships through our national digital bank. Importantly, what really sets Laurel Road apart is our targeted client approach, which results in high-value digital relationships nationally. Currently, 75% of our volume is coming from outside our footprint. Laurel Road is part of a broader health care initiative across our company that has established Key as 1 of the leading health care banks. 
Moving on to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our Investment Banking business generated fees of $235 million, a record third quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. Our broad and comprehensive platform has enabled this business to grow consistently over the past decade. 
Our Investment Banking business has grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years. We are on pace to generate double-digit growth again in 2021. Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make in our franchise in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Year-to-date, we consolidated 73 branches or approximately 7% of our branch network. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support ongoing investments. We will continue to look for opportunities to rightsize our footprint. 
Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained very strong this quarter. Nonperforming loans and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were 11 basis points. We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. 
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.6%, above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. In the third quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program facilitated by the capital relief from the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. The accelerated share repurchase program is part of our previously disclosed $1.5 billion share authorization. 
In total, we repurchased $593 million of common stock in the third quarter. Dividends also remain a priority. Our dividend remains above 3%. Our Board of Directors will consider a dividend increase at our meeting next month. 
I will close by restating that it was another strong quarter. We generated positive operating leverage by growing our top line and managing expenses while continuing to make investments for our future. As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Don, who'll provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?"

For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.65 per common share. Our results reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses, which was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and positive economic outlook. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage this quarter. And as Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year. 
Total revenues were up 8% compared to the same period last year. We had year-over-year growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 18.6%. I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 6. There were 2 major items that impacted loan growth this quarter, PPP loans and the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. Average PPP loans declined $3.3 billion this quarter as we helped clients take advantage of loan forgiveness. We also sold our indirect auto portfolio last month. The sale impacted our third quarter average results by approximately $800 million and $3.3 billion on an ending basis. Average loans were down from the year-ago period, reflecting the reduction in PPP balances and lower commercial line utilization. 
Compared to the prior quarter, average loans were down 0.7%. Adjusting for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio, our loans were up approximately $100 million on average and up over $1 billion on an ending basis. Adding to the comments on our core loan growth, adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and PPP loans our linked quarter total loan growth would have been 4.3%. We continued to see strong consumer loan growth driven by Laurel Road and consumer mortgage. On the commercial side, we were pleased to see a slight uptick in utilization. 
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $147 billion for the third quarter of 2021, up $12 billion or 9% compared to the year ago period and up 2% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances. The growth was partially offset by continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 1 basis point from the second quarter, following a 2 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately 60% of our total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.025 billion for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.006 billion a year ago and $1.023 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.47% for the third quarter of '21 compared to 2.62% for the same period last year and 2.52% for the prior quarter. 
Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to a year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. 
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $2 million and the margin declined 5 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and the benefit of the day count were partially offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. 
For the quarter, total loan fees from PPP loans were $45 million compared to $50 million last quarter. We've also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and our asset liability positioning. In the third quarter, our sensitivity to rising rates moved higher and we ended the period with over $25 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We continue to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from our ongoing investments. Noninterest income was $797 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $681 million for the year ago period and $750 million in the second quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 17%. We had a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $235 million driven by broad-based growth across the platform, including strong M&A fees. 
Additionally, corporate services income increased $18 million and commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $16 million. Offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees due to a lower gain on sale margin. Compared to the second quarter, noninterest income increased by $47 million. The largest driver of this quarterly increase was the record third quarter investment banking and debt placement fees. 
I'm now on Slide 10. We total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.112 billion compared to $1.037 billion last year and $1.076 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we have made to drive future growth. The increase from the year ago period primarily reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation attributed to our higher fee production and Key's increased stock price. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses was primarily driven by 2 areas: the first, personnel expense related to 1 additional day of salary expense in the quarter and slightly higher employee benefits; the second was an increase in other expense of $18 million, largely related a pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions. 
Now moving to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the third quarter, net charge-offs were $29 million or 11 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs in the current quarter included $22 million related to the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio. 
Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $107 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production. Nonperforming loans were $554 million this quarter or 56 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $140 million or 20% from the prior quarter. 
Now on to Slide 12. We ended the third quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. 
Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $593 million of common shares during the quarter our Board of Directors approved a third quarter dividend at $0.185 per common share. Of the $593 million in common share repurchases, $468 million were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program, representing 80% of the $585 million authorization. The remaining $125 million were purchased in the open market. The remaining 20% of the ASR will be settled in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 13, similar to prior years, we provide a guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Guidance ranges are listed at the bottom of the slide. Importantly, using midpoints of this outlook would imply our PPNR is at or above our full year 2021 outlook provided last quarter. We have adjusted our guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance especially in our fee-based businesses as well as the continued strength in our credit quality. 
Average loans will be up low single digits, excluding the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. We expect continued growth in both our core commercial and consumer balances. Average deposits should remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is expected to be down to low single digits, reflecting lower PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter and the impact of the auto loan sale. 
Noninterest income should be relatively stable off our record third quarter performance with momentum in most of our fee-based businesses through year-end. We will also benefit from what we expect to be another record year for our investment banking business. We expect noninterest expense to be down low single digits in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to credit quality. We expect our net charge-offs to be below 20 basis points for the fourth quarter. Credit trends were strong in the third quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate has remained unchanged at 20%. 
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile in improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.

And that's something we challenge all the time that you might see from the materials that this quarter, we had some activity in our bond portfolio with purchases of traditional core investments of about $3.7 billion compared to runoff of $2.1 billion that we saw from the cash flows off the existing portfolio. 
In addition to that, we bought some short-term treasuries of about $4 billion and also the auto securitization transaction ended up increasing our overall bond portfolio by $2.8 billion as well. And so we ended the quarter at about $49 billion of total investments, which is up from the average of $43 billion. 
What I would say is that we've seen a nice tick up in rates that the purchases we made in the third quarter had an average yield of 135. Those same types of investments at the start of the fourth quarter and the 150 to 160 range. So that would probably give us some opportunity to lean a little heavier into portfolio purchases in the fourth quarter and beyond, and we'll continue to assess that. 
We're sitting right now on $25 billion of excess liquidity compared with cash positions and short-term treasuries, and we do plan to put that to work over time. And probably see a clip of something in that $4 billion to $5 billion range near term instead of the $3.7 billion that we purchased in the third quarter and maybe moving that up as we get more and more comfortable with where rates are positioned for the long term."

And so we made the decision to exit the business and then the transaction that we completed just recently with the accelerated share repurchase, just made a whole lot of sense for us because it freed up capital, had a great IRR and frankly, enabled us to eliminate the tail risk at a time when the value of used automobiles was quite high.

We're now in our -- we talk about a 6% asset-sensitive position in our slide deck, and that's higher where it would be traditionally. 
But also available to us going forward in the next year is the redeployment of liquidity. So some of that will be taking out the cash position, which is a variable rate asset -- low earnings variable rate asset, but it's still variable rate and replacing it with long-dated investment securities, and we typically have about a 4-year average life for those securities. 
And so we'll have to take that in consideration as to whether or not we just do more of that or we do additional replacements of the swaps. Right now, we've not been replacing any of the swap maturities and we'll continue to reassess that going forward. So that's just generally how we would manage the overall asset sensitivity position of the company. 
As far as the benefit from the swaps in the third quarter, we had about $76 million of net interest income coming from the swaps. We could see that come down slightly over the next couple of quarters. And then the question will be going forward is what happens with rates. And as the short-term rates move up, you would see that number come down, but we would have seen an offsetting impact from the rates on the commercial loans going up, benefiting from those higher rates. And so that's again, just a summary of where we're positioned today and what impacts there might be going forward."

So almost 2%, so that would take it from a in digit to a mid-single-digit kind of growth expectation on a linked quarter basis. 
And so something similar to what we reported essentially this quarter. As far as the NII outlook, I would say that there's 2 things that are impacting NII outlook for the fourth quarter, you hit on one, which is PPP. And we would expect probably in the neighborhood of a $10 million or so type of decline in PPP revenues. 
The other is the indirect auto loan sale that as a result of the sale, our net interest income will be down, but our fee income will be up. We essentially received 75 basis points for servicing those loans. And so you will see a decline in NII of about $10 million and an increase of fee income in the range of $5 million to help offset that. And those are kind of the moving parts and pieces."

And we've seen incremental improvements this quarter that are outpacing what we've seen before that. And so that would suggest that things are going to be good for some time. But at the same time, I would think that you're probably going to see the consumers start to turn a little sooner. They've been the beneficiary of so much stimulus. And if that starts to slow and go away like we would expect it to, you would start to see some of that start to return to more normal levels over time as well. 
And then the commercial customer, while it's still flushed with liquidity, but we just aren't seeing the early signs of that there's going to be some challenges down the road.

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call. 
I'm now moving to Slide 3. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with net income of $616 million or $0.65 a share. We delivered positive operating leverage and expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year. We delivered record third quarter revenue, which was up 8% from the year ago period. Our results were driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Noninterest income reached a record third quarter level, up 17% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by broad-based growth across our fee-based businesses, including investment banking, which was up 61%. I am especially proud of the way our teammates continue to serve our communities and clients and in doing so, creating new and deeper relationships across our franchise. 
In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in net new households in the first 9 months of the year. Our Western franchise is growing at a rate of over 2x the rest of our footprint, and younger clients continue to be our fastest-growing segment. Additionally, our consumer business generated a record $4.2 billion in loan originations for the quarter, which reflects growth from our consumer mortgage business and Laurel Road. Through the first 9 months of the year, our consumer mortgage originations have exceeded 2020's full year record level of $8.3 billion. 
Laurel Road had another strong quarter as we continued to add and expand high-quality relationships through our national digital bank. Importantly, what really sets Laurel Road apart is our targeted client approach, which results in high-value digital relationships nationally. Currently, 75% of our volume is coming from outside our footprint. Laurel Road is part of a broader health care initiative across our company that has established Key as one of the leading health care banks. 
Moving on to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our investment banking business generated fees of $235 million, a record third quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. Our broad and comprehensive platform has enabled this business to grow consistently over the past decade. Our investment banking business has grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years. We are on pace to generate double-digit growth again in 2021. 
Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make in our franchise in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Year-to-date, we consolidated 73 branches or approximately 7% of our branch network. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support ongoing investments. We will continue to look for opportunities to rightsize our footprint. 
Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained very strong this quarter. Nonperforming loans and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter, and net charge-offs to average loans were 11 basis points. We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.6%, above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. In the third quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program facilitated by the capital relief from the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. The accelerated share repurchase program is part of our previously disclosed $1.5 billion share authorization. In total, we repurchased $593 million of common stock in the third quarter. 
Dividends also remain a priority. Our dividend remains above 3%. Our Board of Directors will consider a dividend increase at our meeting next month. 
I will close by restating that it was another strong quarter. We generated positive operating leverage by growing our top line and managing expenses while continuing to make investments for our future. As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Don, who'll provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?"

For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.65 per common share.

For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.65 per common share. Our results reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses, which was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and positive economic outlook. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage this quarter. And as Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year. 
Total revenues were up 8% compared to the same period last year. We had year-over-year growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 18.6%. I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 6. There were 2 major items that impacted loan growth this quarter, PPP loans and the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. Average PPP loans declined $3.3 billion this quarter as we helped clients take advantage of loan forgiveness. We also sold our indirect auto portfolio last month. The sale impacted our third quarter average results by approximately $800 million and $3.3 billion on an ending basis. Average loans were down from the year ago period, reflecting the reduction in PPP balances and lower commercial line utilization. Compared to the prior quarter, average loans were down 0.7%. Adjusting for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio, our loans were up approximately $100 million on average and up over $1 billion on an ending basis. 
Adding to the comments on our core loan growth, adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and PPP loans, our linked quarter total loan growth would have been 4.3%. We continued to see strong consumer loan growth driven by Laurel Road and consumer mortgage. On the commercial side, we were pleased to see a slight uptick in utilization.
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $147 billion for the third quarter of 2021, up $12 billion or 9% compared to the year ago period and up 2% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances. The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 1 basis point from the second quarter, following a 2 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately 60% of our total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.025 billion for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.006 billion a year ago and $1.023 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.47% for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2.62% for the same period last year and 2.52% for the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to a year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $2 million, and the margin declined 5 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and the benefit of the day count were partially offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. 
For the quarter, total loan fees from PPP loans were $45 million compared to $50 million last quarter. We've also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and our asset/liability positioning. In the third quarter, our sensitivity to rising rates moved higher, and we ended the period with over $25 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We continue to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from our ongoing investments. Noninterest income was $797 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $681 million for the year ago period and $750 million in the second quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 17%. We had a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $235 million, driven by broad-based growth across the platform, including strong M&A fees. Additionally, corporate services income increased $18 million, and commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $16 million. Offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees due to a lower gain on sale margin. Compared to the second quarter, noninterest income increased by $47 million. The largest driver of this quarterly increase was the record third quarter investment banking and debt placement fees. 
I'm now on Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.112 billion compared to $1.037 billion last year and $1.076 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we have made to drive future growth. The increase from the year ago period primarily reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation attributed to our higher fee production and Key's increased stock price. The quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses was primarily driven by 2 areas: the first, personnel expense related to 1 additional day of salary expense in the quarter and slightly higher employee benefits; the second was an increase in other expense of $18 million, largely related to a pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions. 
Now moving to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the third quarter, net charge-offs were $29 million or 11 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs in the current quarter included $22 million related to the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $107 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production. Nonperforming loans were $554 million this quarter or 56 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $140 million or 20% from the prior quarter. 
Now on to Slide 12. We ended the third quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $593 million of common shares during the quarter, and our Board of Directors approved a third quarter dividend at $0.185 per common share. Of the $593 million in common share repurchases, $468 million were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program, representing 80% of the $585 million authorization. The remaining $125 million were purchased in the open market. The remaining 20% of the ASR will be settled in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 13, similar to prior years, we provide a guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Guidance ranges are listed at the bottom of the slide. Importantly, using midpoints of this outlook would imply our PPNR is at or above our full year 2021 outlook provided last quarter. We have adjusted our guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance, especially in our fee-based businesses as well as the continued strength in our credit quality. 
Average loans will be up low single digits, excluding the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. We expect continued growth in both our core commercial and consumer balances. Average deposits should remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is expected to be down to low single digits, reflecting lower PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter and the impact of the auto loan sale. Noninterest income should be relatively stable off our record third quarter performance with momentum in most of our fee-based businesses through year-end. We will also benefit from what we expect to be another record year for our investment banking business. We expect noninterest expense to be down low single digits in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to credit quality. We expect our net charge-offs to be below 20 basis points for the fourth quarter. Credit trends were strong in the third quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate has remained unchanged at 20%. 
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile in improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.

And that's something we challenge all the time that you might see from the materials that this quarter, we had some activity in our bond portfolio with purchases of traditional core investments of about $3.7 billion compared to a runoff of $2.1 billion that we saw from the cash flows off the existing portfolio. In addition to that, we bought some short-term treasuries of about $4 billion. And also, the auto securitization transaction ended up increasing our overall bond portfolio by $2.8 billion as well. And so we ended the quarter at about $49 billion of total investments, which is up from the average of $43 billion. 
What I would say is that we've seen a nice tick up in rates that the purchases we made in the third quarter had an average yield of 135. Those same types of investments at the start of the fourth quarter, in the 150 to 160 range. And so that would probably give us some opportunity to lean a little heavier into portfolio purchases in the fourth quarter and beyond, and we'll continue to assess that. 
We're sitting right now on $25 billion of excess liquidity compared -- with cash positions and short-term treasuries, and we do plan to put that to work over time and probably see a clip of something in that $4 billion to $5 billion range near term instead of the $3.7 billion that we purchased in the third quarter and maybe moving that up as we get more and more comfortable with where rates are positioned for the long term."

We're now in our -- we talk about a 6% asset-sensitive position in our slide deck, and that's higher where it would be traditionally. 
But also available to us going forward in the next year is the redeployment of liquidity. So some of that will be taking out the cash position, which is a variable rate asset, low earning variable rate asset but still variable rate, and replacing it with long-dated investment securities. And we typically have about a 4-year average life for those securities. 
And so we'll have to take that in consideration as to whether or not we just do more of that or we do additional replacements with swaps. Right now, we've not been replacing any of the swap maturities, and we'll continue to reassess that going forward. So that's just generally how we would manage the overall asset sensitivity position of the company. 
As far as the benefit from the swaps in the third quarter, we had about $76 million of net interest income coming from the swaps. We could see that come down slightly over the next couple of quarters. And then the question will be going forward is what happens with rates. And as the short-term rates move up, you would see that number come down, but we would have seen an offsetting impact from the rates on the commercial loans going up, benefiting from those higher rates. And so that's, again, just a summary of where we're positioned today and what impacts there might be going forward."

If we added on the impact of the PPP forgiveness and loan balance expectations there, that would add another $1.8 billion to the overall loan growth, so almost 2%. So that would take it from a low single-digit to a mid-single-digit kind of growth expectation on a linked quarter basis. And so something similar to what we reported essentially this quarter. 
As far as the NII outlook, I would say that there's 2 things that are impacting NII outlook for the fourth quarter. You hit on one, which is PPP. And we would expect probably in the neighborhood of a $10 million or so type of decline in PPP revenues. The other is the indirect auto loan sale that as a result of the sale, our net interest income will be down, but our fee income will be up. We essentially receive 75 basis points for servicing those loans. And so you will see a decline in NII of about $10 million and an increase of fee income in the range of $5 million to help offset that. And those are kind of the moving parts and pieces."

So our relationship with fintech partners has really been both important and helpful for us. As a bank, we were in early, and I think it's really helped us successfully execute our targeted scale strategy. Frankly, it's helped us kind of with our client service strategy, our sales strategy. It's also clearly contributed to our thinking as we developed our technology road map. We are clearly tied into the entire fintech ecosystem. And our unique strategy is both known and understood by the fintech community, which is helpful. 
Going to your question of how many relationships we have, I would say, today, we have probably 10 client-facing relationships. We literally have dozens of infrastructure relationships with fintechs. Because we're sort of known in the whole ecosystem, we see a lot, maybe 15 or 20 opportunities every single month that we kind of sort through. Kind of if you step back and take a look and think about kind of from a strategic perspective, our targeted scale strategy just makes us a great partner because we have such distinct client groups. And obviously, as you're developing software, that's really helpful. 
What we have done at Key in Laurel Road is we've built this national digital affinity bank, which is a relationship approach to digital banking. What fintechs really are best at is really solving one pain point and doing it extremely well. So it's been a good relationship probably for -- I can certainly say for us, and I'm sure it's been a good relationship for the fintechs as well."

One is that as far as our overall credit quality position, for many of the metrics today, we're actually better than what we were pre-pandemic. So if you look at nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, the delinquency stats for consumer and commercial loans are all better than where they were pre-pandemic. Our criticized and classified are a little higher than what they were before the pandemic, but coming down dramatically. And we've seen incremental improvements this quarter that are outpacing what we've seen before that. And so that would suggest that things are going to be good for some time. But at the same time, I would think that you're probably going to see the consumers start to turn a little sooner. They've been the beneficiary of so much stimulus. And if that starts to slow and go away like we would expect it to, you would start to see some of that start to return to more normal levels over time as well. 
And then the commercial customer, while it's still flushed with liquidity, but we just aren't seeing the early signs of that there's going to be some challenges down the road. And so I think that we're going to be in a period for some time where we're going to see charge-offs below the low end of guidance ranges across the industry."

I'm now moving to Slide 3. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with net income of $616 million or $0.65 a share. We delivered positive operating leverage and expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year. We delivered record third quarter revenue, which was up 8% from the year ago period. Our results were driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Noninterest income reached a record third quarter level, up 17% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by broad-based growth across our fee-based businesses, including investment banking, which was up 61%. I am especially proud of the way our teammates continue to serve our communities and clients and in doing so, creating new and deeper relationships across our franchise.
In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in net new households in the first 9 months of the year. Our Western franchise is growing at a rate of over 2x the rest of our footprint, and younger clients continue to be our fastest-growing segment. Additionally, our consumer business generated a record $4.2 billion in loan originations for the quarter, which reflects growth from our consumer mortgage business and Laurel Road. Through the first 9 months of the year, our consumer mortgage originations have exceeded 2020's full year record level of $8.3 billion. 
Laurel Road had another strong quarter as we continued to add and expand high-quality relationships through our national digital bank. Importantly, what really sets Laurel Road apart is our targeted client approach, which results in high-value digital relationships nationally. Currently, 75% of our volume is coming from outside our footprint. Laurel Road is part of a broader health care initiative across our company that has established Key as one of the leading health care banks. 
Moving on to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our investment banking business generated fees of $235 million, a record third quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. Our broad and comprehensive platform has enabled this business to grow consistently over the past decade. Our investment banking business has grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years. We are on pace to generate double-digit growth again in 2021. 
Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make in our franchise in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Year-to-date, we consolidated 73 branches or approximately 7% of our branch network. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support ongoing investments. We will continue to look for opportunities to rightsize our footprint. 
Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained very strong this quarter. Nonperforming loans and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter, and net charge-offs to average loans were 11 basis points. We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.6%, above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. In the third quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program facilitated by the capital relief from the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. The accelerated share repurchase program is part of our previously disclosed $1.5 billion share authorization. In total, we repurchased $593 million of common stock in the third quarter. 
Dividends also remain a priority. Our dividend remains above 3%. Our Board of Directors will consider a dividend increase at our meeting next month. 
I will close by restating that it was another strong quarter. We generated positive operating leverage by growing our top line and managing expenses while continuing to make investments for our future. As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Don, who'll provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?"

For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.65 per common share. Our results reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses, which was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and positive economic outlook. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage this quarter. And as Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year. 
Total revenues were up 8% compared to the same period last year. We had year-over-year growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 18.6%. I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation. 
Turning to Slide 6. There were 2 major items that impacted loan growth this quarter, PPP loans and the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. Average PPP loans declined $3.3 billion this quarter as we helped clients take advantage of loan forgiveness. We also sold our indirect auto portfolio last month. The sale impacted our third quarter average results by approximately $800 million and $3.3 billion on an ending basis. Average loans were down from the year ago period, reflecting the reduction in PPP balances and lower commercial line utilization. Compared to the prior quarter, average loans were down 0.7%. Adjusting for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio, our loans were up approximately $100 million on average and up over $1 billion on an ending basis. 
Adding to the comments on our core loan growth, adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and PPP loans, our linked quarter total loan growth would have been 4.3%. We continued to see strong consumer loan growth driven by Laurel Road and consumer mortgage. On the commercial side, we were pleased to see a slight uptick in utilization.
Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $147 billion for the third quarter of 2021, up $12 billion or 9% compared to the year ago period and up 2% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances. The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 1 basis point from the second quarter, following a 2 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately 60% of our total deposit mix. 
Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.025 billion for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $1.006 billion a year ago and $1.023 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.47% for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2.62% for the same period last year and 2.52% for the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to a year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $2 million, and the margin declined 5 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and the benefit of the day count were partially offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. 
For the quarter, total loan fees from PPP loans were $45 million compared to $50 million last quarter. We've also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and our asset/liability positioning. In the third quarter, our sensitivity to rising rates moved higher, and we ended the period with over $25 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Moving on to Slide 9. We continue to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from our ongoing investments. Noninterest income was $797 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $681 million for the year ago period and $750 million in the second quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 17%. We had a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $235 million, driven by broad-based growth across the platform, including strong M&A fees. Additionally, corporate services income increased $18 million, and commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $16 million. Offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees due to a lower gain on sale margin. Compared to the second quarter, noninterest income increased by $47 million. The largest driver of this quarterly increase was the record third quarter investment banking and debt placement fees. 
I'm now on Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.112 billion compared to $1.037 billion last year and $1.076 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we have made to drive future growth. The increase from the year ago period primarily reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation attributed to our higher fee production and Key's increased stock price. The quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses was primarily driven by 2 areas: the first, personnel expense related to 1 additional day of salary expense in the quarter and slightly higher employee benefits; the second was an increase in other expense of $18 million, largely related to a pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions. 
Now moving to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the third quarter, net charge-offs were $29 million or 11 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs in the current quarter included $22 million related to the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $107 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production. Nonperforming loans were $554 million this quarter or 56 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $140 million or 20% from the prior quarter. 
Now on to Slide 12. We ended the third quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $593 million of common shares during the quarter, and our Board of Directors approved a third quarter dividend at $0.185 per common share. Of the $593 million in common share repurchases, $468 million were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program, representing 80% of the $585 million authorization. The remaining $125 million were purchased in the open market. The remaining 20% of the ASR will be settled in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 13, similar to prior years, we provide a guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Guidance ranges are listed at the bottom of the slide. Importantly, using midpoints of this outlook would imply our PPNR is at or above our full year 2021 outlook provided last quarter. We have adjusted our guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance, especially in our fee-based businesses as well as the continued strength in our credit quality. 
Average loans will be up low single digits, excluding the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio. We expect continued growth in both our core commercial and consumer balances. Average deposits should remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is expected to be down to low single digits, reflecting lower PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter and the impact of the auto loan sale. Noninterest income should be relatively stable off our record third quarter performance with momentum in most of our fee-based businesses through year-end. We will also benefit from what we expect to be another record year for our investment banking business. We expect noninterest expense to be down low single digits in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to credit quality. We expect our net charge-offs to be below 20 basis points for the fourth quarter. Credit trends were strong in the third quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate has remained unchanged at 20%. 
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile in improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.

And that's something we challenge all the time that you might see from the materials that this quarter, we had some activity in our bond portfolio with purchases of traditional core investments of about $3.7 billion compared to a runoff of $2.1 billion that we saw from the cash flows off the existing portfolio. In addition to that, we bought some short-term treasuries of about $4 billion. And also, the auto securitization transaction ended up increasing our overall bond portfolio by $2.8 billion as well. And so we ended the quarter at about $49 billion of total investments, which is up from the average of $43 billion. 
What I would say is that we've seen a nice tick up in rates that the purchases we made in the third quarter had an average yield of 135. Those same types of investments at the start of the fourth quarter, in the 150 to 160 range. And so that would probably give us some opportunity to lean a little heavier into portfolio purchases in the fourth quarter and beyond, and we'll continue to assess that. 
We're sitting right now on $25 billion of excess liquidity compared -- with cash positions and short-term treasuries, and we do plan to put that to work overtime and probably see a clip of something in that $4 billion to $5 billion range near term instead of the $3.7 billion that we purchased in the third quarter and maybe moving that up as we get more and more comfortable with where rates are positioned for the long term."

And so we made the decision to exit the business.

We're now in our -- we talk about a 6% asset-sensitive position in our slide deck, and that's higher where it would be traditionally. 
But also available to us going forward in the next year is the redeployment of liquidity. So some of that will be taking out the cash position, which is a variable rate asset, low earning variable rate asset but still variable rate, and replacing it with long-dated investment securities. And we typically have about a 4-year average life for those securities. 
And so we'll have to take that in consideration as to whether or not we just do more of that or we do additional replacements with swaps. Right now, we've not been replacing any of the swap maturities, and we'll continue to reassess that going forward. So that's just generally how we would manage the overall asset sensitivity position of the company.
As far as the benefit from the swaps in the third quarter, we had about $76 million of net interest income coming from the swaps. We could see that come down slightly over the next couple of quarters. And then the question will be going forward is what happens with rates. And as the short-term rates move up, you would see that number come down, but we would have seen an offsetting impact from the rates on the commercial loans going up, benefiting from those higher rates. And so that's, again, just a summary of where we're positioned today and what impacts there might be going forward."

So that would take it from a low single-digit to a mid-single-digit kind of growth expectation on a linked quarter basis. And so something similar to what we reported essentially this quarter. 
As far as the NII outlook, I would say that there's 2 things that are impacting NII outlook for the fourth quarter. You hit on one, which is PPP. And we would expect probably in the neighborhood of a $10 million or so type of decline in PPP revenues. The other is the indirect auto loan sale that as a result of the sale, our net interest income will be down, but our fee income will be up. We essentially receive 75 basis points for servicing those loans. And so you will see a decline in NII of about $10 million and an increase of fee income in the range of $5 million to help offset that. And those are kind of the moving parts and pieces."

And our unique strategy is both known and understood by the fintech community, which is helpful. 
Going to your question of how many relationships we have, I would say, today, we have probably 10 client-facing relationships. We literally have dozens of infrastructure relationships with fintechs. Because we're sort of known in the whole ecosystem, we see a lot, maybe 15 or 20 opportunities every single month that we kind of sort through.

I think we are in -- I can speak for Key, I think the derisking that we've gone about for the last 10 years is going to serve us extremely well. We won't stay at a level this low. But I actually think, as we look into 2022, you're still going to see us below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points."

One is that as far as our overall credit quality position, for many of the metrics today, we're actually better than what we were pre-pandemic. So if you look at nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, the delinquency stats for consumer and commercial loans are all better than where they were pre-pandemic. Our criticized and classified are a little higher than what they were before the pandemic, but coming down dramatically. And we've seen incremental improvements this quarter that are outpacing what we've seen before that. And so that would suggest that things are going to be good for some time. But at the same time, I would think that you're probably going to see the consumers start to turn a little sooner. They've been the beneficiary of so much stimulus. And if that starts to slow and go away like we would expect it to, you would start to see some of that start to return to more normal levels over time as well.
And then the commercial customer, while it's still flushed with liquidity, but we just aren't seeing the early signs of that there's going to be some challenges down the road. And so I think that we're going to be in a period for some time where we're going to see charge-offs below the low end of guidance ranges across the industry."

So Gerard, we've never broken out each of the different components, our investment banking fees. I can tell you that our M&A business was extremely strong. And you can imagine the equity business was very strong, given that we have a focus on technology. So those were a couple just bright spots broadly.
As it relates to our mix of what's distributed and what we put on our balance sheet, it's actually been very consistent over a long period of time. We've always basically held -- of the credits that we take on, we've always held about 20% on our balance sheet. So we really haven't dialed that up at all. We've been just maintaining our moderate risk profile and taking advantage of what are some pretty attractive markets out there."
