I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Before getting started, I hope all of you on the call, your families and your colleagues are safe in light of the continuing challenges we face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
I am pleased to welcome Darren Woods, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of ExxonMobil, who will be joining me for the call today. After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives on 2020 and updates on our priorities and plans for 2021 and beyond. Following those remarks, Darren and I will be happy to address questions. 
Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. 
I'll now highlight development since the third quarter of this year on the next slide. In the Upstream, gas realizations increased by approximately 40%, with demand and prices recovering from lows earlier in 2020, reflecting the impact of supply disruptions, colder weather and crude-linked LNG pricing. Liquids realizations were essentially flat with the third quarter with low October prices improving as the quarter progressed. 
While there were no economic curtailments in the quarter, government-mandated curtailments increased to approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, the Upstream business matched its best ever reliability performance for the year. 
We continue to progress active exploration programs in Guyana and Brazil and in the fourth quarter, announced a hydrocarbon discovery in Suriname, which extends ExxonMobil's resource position in South America. In the Downstream, we achieved the best-ever personnel and process safety as well as record reliability performance for the year. 
Industry refining margins remained at historic lows, driving industry rationalization with 4x the 10-year average level of capacity reductions announced in 2020. With continuing weak margins, we expect further industry closures. 
The Chemical business matched the strong operational performance of the Upstream and Downstream, also achieving best-ever annual safety and reliability performance. This excellent performance enabled us to fully capture the improving margins driven by sustained strength in packaging and continued recovery in automotive and durable product markets. 
Across the corporation, we exceeded the operating cost and CapEx reduction targets that we laid out in April. We decisively responded to the unprecedented market conditions in 2020. Leveraging our global projects organization, we were able to defer spend and optimize projects to preserve the long-term value of our industry-leading investment portfolio. 
Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of fourth quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of fourth quarter results relative to the third quarter. Starting with third quarter 2020, the reported loss of $700 million included favorable identified items of $100 million, driven by the noncash inventory adjustments we noted in the third quarter. Excluding these items, the third quarter loss was $800 million. 
Fourth quarter results were a loss of $20.1 billion, including $20.2 billion of identified items related to impairments. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $100 million, a $900 million improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter results were $200 million lower than the third quarter due to mark-to-market impacts on unsettled derivatives. This reflects the impact of marking-to-market open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy has not closed at the end of the quarter. We expect to realize the full earnings of these trading strategies when they close in the future. 
Improvements in upstream, natural gas and LNG prices as well as increased liquids production  in Guyana also benefited earnings. Continued strong demand for high-value chemical performance products, coupled with the strong reliability supported chemical earnings improvement of $200 million. 
Finally, as a result of the growing strength of our portfolio, we removed less strategic assets from our development plans, including certain dry gas resources, notably in North America. This resulted in a noncash after-tax impairment charge of about $19 billion. 
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items. 
Moving to Slide 5. Improved prices and margins in the Upstream and Chemical increased earnings by $530 million. The benefit of higher upstream liquids production in Guyana, Canada and the U.S. also improved earnings. This was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of planned turnaround, maintenance and exploration activity. 
In the Downstream and Chemical, our integrated manufacturing sites allowed us to rapidly respond to dynamic market conditions and capture significant feedstock benefits. For example, we optimized units that typically produce gasoline to increased production of high-value chemical feedstocks, critical to the manufacturing of gowns, mask and hand sanitizer. Manufacturing results in the Downstream were improved with strong reliability and investments at high-grade product yields contributing $160 million to the fourth quarter earnings. 
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of the full year results. 
Slide 6 is a comparison of full year 2020 results relative to 2019. Results reflected the unprecedented loss in demand driven by the economic impact of COVID, which in turn significantly depress Upstream and Downstream margins. In responding to pandemic-related challenges, the organization rapidly reduced costs, achieving $3 billion in structural savings out of a total reduction of $8 billion. Our manufacturing facilities contributed an additional $1 billion with better reliability and improved product yields. 
Moving to upstream volumes on Slide 7. Upstream volumes decreased by an average of approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2019. Volumes were impacted by economic and government-mandated curtailments as well as [indiscernible] production limits, which in total reduced volumes by approximately 210,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Excluding the impact of economic and government-mandated curtailments entitlements production limits and divestments, volumes increased by about 110,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. This was in line with our original production plans with optimization of maintenance activity reducing the impact of economic curtailments. 
Moving to Slide 8. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15% and CapEx by 30%. We exceeded these reduction targets. 
Looking at capital spending, we established reductions of 30%. The reorganization of our Upstream and Downstream businesses a couple of years ago enabled us to accelerate the efficiency capture that we expected from these changes. 
Cash operating expenses were down $8 billion versus 2019, including structural reductions of about $3 billion that were delivered through optimization of supply chains and logistics, work process simplification and workforce reductions. We leveraged our new global projects organization and strong relationships with EPCs to adjust our capital plan, deferring spend and further optimizing projects. This allowed us to reduce quarterly spend by $2 billion in the second quarter versus the first quarter, a 25% reduction. As we continue this work through the year, we reduced capital expenditures by $10 billion or greater than 30% versus 2019 in the original plan. Importantly, we did this while improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operations. 
Let's turn to the next page, where you can see the impact of these reductions on our cash profile. Excluding the impact of working capital effects, fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $600 million from the third quarter. Gross debt decreased by about $1.2 billion to $67.6 billion. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion of cash, a little above our minimum operating levels. 
Turning to Slide 10, I'll cover a few key considerations for the first quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels [for ]  The fourth quarter. Production is expected to be higher in the first quarter due to seasonal gas demand. 
In the Downstream, we anticipate higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds to be offset by additional efficiencies. In Chemical, we anticipate continued demand resilience across packaging, hygiene and medical segments with continuing recovery in automotive and construction markets. Scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter. Corporate and finance expenses are anticipated to be about $700 million. 
Lastly, at current crude prices and downstream and chemical margins, we expect cash flow from operating activities to cover the dividend and our planned CapEx, which has flexibility to adjust depending on the business environment. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Darren."

I'm sure I'm like many of you, happy to close the book on 2020 and optimistic for the year ahead. 
As you know, the pandemic has had devastating impacts on people and businesses around the world. These effects were especially severe in our industry. Energy consumption collapsed as economy shut down. Oil prices hit their lowest point in history, and refining margins fell well below their 10-year lows. It was the first time in memory that we saw simultaneous lows in each of our businesses. 
As I discussed a year ago, our response throughout these challenging times was primarily focused on 3 areas: protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to support COVID response efforts, providing critical energy and products and aggressively reducing spend while preserving value to ensure we remain in the best possible position for the eventual recovery. 
We're pleased with how we performed on each of these. Our employees stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products from hand sanitizer to specialty products for protective equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts, we kept operations running 24/7, while achieving strong safety results and exceptional reliability performance. At the same time, we leveraged on the ongoing work in reorganizing our Upstream and Downstream businesses to significantly reduce cost and preserve value in an extremely challenging and uncertain market environment. 
We delivered on our cost reduction objectives and outperformed our revised plan, which we shared with you in April. Going forward, we're continuing to work to reduce cost by leveraging synergies from aligned organizations and work processes across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. Further opportunities are being identified to reduce cost to drive cash flow and maintain our capital allocation priorities, including paying a strong dividend and maintaining a fortified balance sheet that we deleverage over time. 
I'll provide more detail momentarily on the successful efforts to drive greater efficiency across our businesses and further improve our cost structure. I'll also spend time discussing the significant steps we're taking to reduce emissions intensity and absolute emissions and our work to advance lower-emission technologies, like our newly announced Low Carbon Solutions business. Collectively, this will help position us as an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance while helping society move to a lower carbon future. 
Let me start, though, by highlighting a few notable achievements from 2020 in what was a very difficult business environment. During a year of unprecedented challenges, our people successfully managed our global operations, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products while achieving best-ever safety and reliability performance. 
We reduced cash operating expenses by more than 15%, including $3 billion of structural improvements and reduced capital investments by more than 30% to $21 billion without compromising the advantages or value of our projects. We achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals for both methane and flaring and established new plans for 2025 that are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. These plans are expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. 
Permian Basin volumes exceeded our plan at 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day despite curtailments and reduced investment. This performance was driven by significant ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and technology development. 
We progressed Liza Phase 2 and Payara developments in Guyana and continued our exploration success with 3 new discoveries, increasing the recoverable resource estimate on the Stabroek Block to nearly 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. Our Chemical business set a new record for polyethylene sales, reflecting the growth in demand for performance packaging and strong operating performance of our expanding asset fleet. We maintained our position as a global leader in carbon capture, one we've held for more than 30 years, by increasing sequester CO2 to more than 120 million tons. This is well over twice the next closest competitor and larger than the next 5 competitors combined. To put this in perspective, 120 million tons is equivalent to taking more than 25 million passenger vehicles off the road in a year. 
In 2020, we focused on managing through the impacts of an unprecedented industry environment, leveraging the strengths of our corporation to progress an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities critical to the long-term success of the company. At the same time, we drove deep structural efficiencies to improve competitiveness and position ourselves amongst the industry's lowest cost of supply. 
Let me start with our efficiencies. You may recall that in 2019, we completed our corporate reorganizations, moving from functional companies to businesses organized along their value chains. This allowed us to reduce overhead and provided end-to-end oversight for each business, which was a critical first step in streamlining the businesses to structurally reduce cost. It also allowed us to more effectively prioritize work and focus on the highest-value activities. 
Consistent organizations across each sector are allowing us to consolidate like activities to fully leverage the corporation's scale, further reducing cost and improving effectiveness. Our global products organization was established in 2019 as a result of this approach. This organization has played a critical role in reoptimizing our global investment portfolio, improving the capital efficiency of each project and when necessary, cost effectively deferring work. As we came into 2020 in the pandemic, the organization changes provided the foundation for significantly reducing spend across the businesses. 
Expense results are shown in this chart, which is consistent with the chart Stephen showed, excluding production taxes and energy expenses that are a function of commodity price. As you can see, 60% of the $5 billion reduction from 2019 to 2020 was structural, driven by reduced overheads and operational efficiencies. The remaining reductions were temporary, driven by lower production and activity deferrals. 
During last year's planning process, each organization identified opportunities to convert the short-term or temporary expense reductions and to permanent structural efficiencies. This year, we expect to achieve a further $1 billion of structural efficiencies. By 2023, we will achieve a total of $6 billion in structural expense reductions versus 2019. I expect even further reductions as we take advantage of additional synergies unlocked by consistently organized businesses. 
One final point to make on this slide. The structural reductions we've shown are independent of the price environment we find ourselves in. On the other hand, returning activity and increased expenses between 2020 and 2023 are in large part a function of the price environment. In lower price environments, much of that increase would be further deferred. 
Let me now turn to another critical area, our capital investments. Over the past several years, we have been progressing a strategy to high grade our asset base and improve the earnings and cash generation potential of our businesses. We announced work to divest less strategic assets and have been progressing a portfolio of industry-leading investments. With pandemic-driven losses, we responded quickly to bring capital spending in line with market conditions and an uncertain outlook and preserve our strong dividend. 
As we enter 2021, our capital plan is at a historic low, significantly reduced from 2020 levels. Our capital plans through 2025 reflect 3 key themes: value, flexibility and discipline: value derived from advancing our highest return, cash-flow-accretive projects to deliver increased earnings and cash, both near and long term; flexibility to respond to a dynamic market, we demonstrated this in 2020 and have developed our plans with this in mind; and discipline to make adjustments to our capital program, depending on market conditions to support a strong dividend and begin to delever. Our plans are built on a price basis consistent with third-party outlooks and advance our highest return investments. We maintain a healthy balance sheet and our strong dividend. They are robust to a wide range of price scenarios and using last year's experience and flexibility to respond to lower price environments. 
In each plan year, we have a level of short-cycle unconventional spend, which can be reduced in line with market conditions. We also expect to restart projects that have been suspended across this time horizon, but if necessary, can be delayed longer, further deferring spend. We also have a level of early investments that fund long-term growth opportunities. These, too, can be deferred or suspended. While each of these reductions impact the value of our plan that are available as circumstances warrant, less flexible spend can also be reduced but at a higher cost. This capital is generally longer cycle, more firmly committed or very near completion. 
The next slide helps quantify our capital flexibility. On the left of this graphic, we show available cash from operations for our 2021 plan at different Brent prices, assuming the lowest refining and chemical margins experienced from 2010 to 2019. This is our source. with higher crude prices generating more available cash. 
As you move right, you see our uses: the current dividend and our 2021 CapEx from the previous page. As you can see, the breakeven Brent price needed to pay our dividend and invest in the low end of our flexible capital is roughly $45 a barrel. The Brent price required for $16 billion, which is the low end of our guidance and closer to where I expect our actual spend to be in 2021 is $50 a barrel. 
With Downstream and Chemical margins at the bottom of the 10-year historical range, we can fund our highest-return investments in Guyana the Permian and the Chemical business and begin paying down debt at Brent prices just above $50 a barrel. If Downstream and Chemical margins were at their 10-year averages,
Brent breakeven prices would be roughly $5 a barrel lower, which would allow us to fund investments, pay the dividend and pay down debt at Brent prices above $45 a barrel. 
As we look at the market year-to-date, actual prices and margins in total are above our plan, allowing us to progress our investments, pay the dividend and begin paying down debt in the first quarter. Obviously, we are very early into the year, and we know the market will change. We're keeping a close eye on developments, and we'll adjust our capital spend accordingly, protecting the strong dividend and preserving the balance sheet. 
Let's shift to a later year in our plan, 2025. By 2025, we expect Downstream and Chemical margins to be off their lows and closer to a long-term average. In this case, we use the average margins from 2010 to 2019. In addition, we will see the full benefits of the structural OpEx improvements and additional cash from the projects that come online by 2025. 
As you can see, there is substantially more flexibility in our capital spend. As a result, our plans continue to cover the dividend and capital investments at Brent prices as low as $35 a barrel. At Brent prices above $50 a barrel, our capital allocation framework supports our planned investments, further debt reduction and/or shareholder distributions. 
So as you can see, our plans are robust to a wide range of price environments. And while we are optimistic that the recent improvements in the macro environment will continue, we recognize that much could change over the next 4 to 5 years. If we face a year where Brent prices remain below $50 a barrel on a sustained basis, we would reduce investments to levels more consistent with this year's plan. 
Recognizing the market uncertainty, we've attempted to strike the right balance between maintaining a strong dividend, fortifying the balance sheet to delever and continuing to invest in high-return cash accretive projects. This last point is critical, particularly in a depletion business. The next chart gives a good perspective of this. 
Our investment strategy is focused on growing earnings and cash flow across a wide range of market environments. We are investing in advantaged projects with some of the industry's lowest cost of supply. They grow earnings and cash flow in a variety of market environments. This graphic helps to illustrate this. 
Using IHS crude price and third-party margins, we expect the cash flow from project start-ups over our investment horizon to represent roughly 40% of our operating cash flow in 2025. This makes a critical point. You pay a significant long-term cost for excessive short-term investment reductions. When industry does it collectively, the market pays with much higher commodity prices. Striking the right balance, responding to short-term constraints with an eye on the mid to long term, generates the greatest value.
Of course, an investment portfolio of industry-advantaged projects is critical. The next slide provides a perspective of the investments we are making in developing Upstream resources, which represents the majority of our Upstream capital spend. 
This chart graphs cumulative upstream capital spend to develop resources from 2021 through 2025 against the Brent price required for the investment to generate a 10% return, which we deemed our cost of supply. As you can see, our focus on high-return, lowest cost of supply investments generated a portfolio with a cost of supply well below $3 a barrel. In fact, almost 90% of our investments in developing upstream resources have a cost of supply of $35 per barrel or less. These investments generate an average return using third-party price outlooks in excess of 30%. 
So as you can see, striking the right balance, progressing a very attractive portfolio of investments while maintaining our strong dividend and fortifying the balance sheet to delever is essential to maximizing value, both near term and long term. When executed in a period where others are pulling back and construction markets are slack, these investments become even more attractive. When you factor in the flexibility of our short-cycle investments in the Permian, where the value proposition continues to grow, we are well positioned. We have an attractive investment portfolio that we can flex with market conditions to strike the right balance across our capital allocation priorities. 
Let me now take a few minutes to highlight the progress we've been making in the Permian. Despite challenging additions and a rapid change in activity, our progress in the Permian exceeded our plan and expectations. These improvements reflect the hard work of our people, the organizational changes made in 2019 and the continued evolution of our technology and techniques. 
In 2019, we better integrated the experience of our global drilling, technology and project organizations with the unconventional operating organization. Working together, they made a step change in performance that continues to improve. 
2020 drilling rates were 50% better than our plan and more than 20% better than full year 2019 results. Drilling and completion costs were 15% below our plan and more than 25% lower than 2019 results. We estimate that rough example, the number of frac stages achieved in a day increased by 30% versus 2019. 
As we enter 2021, we continue to see progress in our key performance metrics, further growing the value of this resource and improving upon our plans. In 2020, capital expenditures in the Permian were 35% below plan. Despite significant economic curtailments in the second quarter, 2020 volumes of 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day exceeded our plan. We're about 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day above 2019. Going forward, with the pandemic-related impacts on our balance sheet and market outlook, we are pacing Permian investments to maintain positive free cash flow, deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and achieve double-digit returns at less than $35 a barrel. 
Based on the current market price projections, our plans result in Permian volumes of approximately 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by 2025. If demand and prices are lower than current third-party outlooks, we'll adjust our plans. At a nominal Brent price of $50 a barrel through 2025, we would expect to deliver an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2025 versus 2020 production levels. 
Key point here is that we have flexibility and options, which I expect to improve with time. We've been making significant progress on our technology programs, which are contributing to current performance. With the advances we are making, I expect continued improvements in productivity activity, growing volumes at even lower cost. Hopefully, the Permian discussion and broader overview of our investment plans provided a useful perspective on the opportunities we have and the balance we are attempting to strike across our capital allocation priorities, amid an uncertain market outlook. 
I'd like to move on to the results we've achieved in lowering our emissions and the plans we have for further reductions. But before I do, I'd like to recap some key points. Our portfolio offers the best collection of investment opportunities we've had in over 20 years. They are some of the industry's lowest cost of supply projects with strong returns that are robust to low prices. Coupled with our expense efficiencies, our capital program through 2025 improves the earnings power and cash generation potential of our asset base in both the near and long term. Leveraging our experience from 2020, we've built flexible plans that will allow us to adjust to market developments and potentially lower prices. If prices move higher than our planned basis, this will allow us to more quickly replenish our balance sheet. Our plans strike the right balance, growing value, maintaining a strong dividend and a fortified balance sheet that is delevered over time. 
Let's turn to our work and position the company for a lower carbon energy future. Addressing the risk of climate change is one of society's biggest challenges, requiring the combined effort and collaboration of governments, academia, businesses and consumers. ExxonMobil has spent decades researching new technologies and deploying existing ones to lower our emissions in the emissions of our customers. Today, we remain committed to this,, with plans to position ExxonMobil as a leader in our industry. 
Since its inception, we have supported the goals of the Paris agreement, engaging in climate-related policies and supporting a tax on carbon. Since 2016, the year of the Paris agreement, we've reduced our operating greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Last year, we met the reduction objectives we set in 2018 and in the fourth quarter, announced new emission reduction plans for 2025 that are consistent with the goals of Paris. 
Our plans to reduce emissions from operated assets align the company with the World Bank's initiative to eliminate routine flaring. To reduce the intensity of our operated upstream in greenhouse gas emissions, they drive a decrease in methane intensity and a decrease in flaring intensity. This is expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% and absolute methane and flaring emissions by 40% to 50% versus 2016 levels. 
Our plans continue to invest in lower-emissions initiatives with an expect to spend more than $500 million a year. This includes energy efficiency, CCS investments, cogeneration, research and development and renewable purchases, an area where we already make a significant contribution. 
Today, we are the second largest buyer of wind and solar power in the oil and gas industry and among the top 5% across all corporations, purchasing roughly 600 megawatts. While we don't bring a significant competitive advantage to many wind and solar projects, we can leverage our size to support world-scale developments with purchase contracts, helping to ensure they are built. 
We're also the world's leader in carbon capture, responsible for over 40% of the CO2 captured. To put this into context, the Nature Conservatory announced a campaign in 2008 to plant 1 billion trees. Our cumulative CO2 capture is more than double that goal. 
We are also one of the world's largest producers of hydrogen. As the potential for this and the energy transition develops, we are well positioned to leverage our experience, scale and technology to contribute. In fact, to ensure that we effectively leverage all of our technologies, experiences and expertise, yesterday, we announced the formation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This business will focus on advancing commercial CCS opportunities and deploying emerging technologies as they mature. I'll come back to our plans for this in a moment as we expect it to underpin our long-term strategy in driving emission reductions. I want to first focus on the progress we've already made. 
As you can see in this chart, since the inception of the Paris agreement, ExxonMobil has made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, down 6%, significantly outpacing the progress made by society as a whole. 
Over the past 20 years, we have invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower emissions energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations. During that time, we eliminated or avoided about 480 million tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 100 million cars. The plans we announced in December further reduced the intensity of our businesses, delivering an expected reduction in emissions of roughly 12% by 2025. 
I want to pause here for a minute and emphasize that these are not targets. These reductions are built into our base plans. 
In conjunction with the reorganizations completed in 2019, we established a more rigorous process to capture emission reduction efforts at operating units around the world. Plans developed in 2020 leverage this process and built-in additional efficiency steps and accretive investments to deliver these reductions. Like other plan objectives, the performance of our businesses and our senior management will be evaluated based on achieving these commitments. I think it's important to point out that our plans are in line with the stated ambitions of the Paris agreement, which you can see on the next chart. 
This slide overlays both global and ExxonMobil emissions since 2016 with the goals of the Paris agreement, hypothetical 1.5-degree and 2-degree Celsius pathways. As you can see, our plans are consistent with the stated ambitions. Of course, the challenge will be maintaining our progress into the future for both ExxonMobil and society at large. 
Today, the set of solutions available in overcoming this challenge is incomplete. There's a gap between what is needed and what is available. This is illustrated by the 2016 Paris submissions shown by the green diamond, which is an estimate of the signatories nationally determined contributions. 
We are working to close this gap and help provide solutions for society. Our investment in R&D is focused on the world's highest-emitting sectors: manufacturing, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for 80% of global energy-related carbon emissions and where today's alternatives are insufficient. 
As I said earlier, through 2025, we expect to invest more than $3 billion in lower emissions initiatives, which include energy-efficient process technology, advanced biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, which is a crucial technology for achieving the goals outlined in the Paris agreement. Carbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in addressing emissions from difficulty decarbonized sectors. It is also generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions. And the 2 degrees scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is estimated that in 2040, 10% of total energy will require CCS. It's also estimated that 15% of global emissions will be mitigated by CCS. If carbon capture and storage does not progress and play a significant role in decarbonizing the economy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that society's cost of achieving a 2-degree outcome would more than double, increasing the cost by 138%. 
In short, the world is unlikely to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement without focused action and innovation and carbon capture and storage. Unfortunately, according to the IEA, its development and deployment are not on track. This is an area where we can potentially leverage unique capabilities to make a difference. 
ExxonMobil has been the global leader in carbon capture for more than 30 years. We believe there's an opportunity to leverage our deep operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution skills, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology to uniquely contribute in this area. 
In 2018, we formed a carbon capture venture to identify and develop potential CCS opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies. This group has been working with governments, industry, academia and tech companies to advance projects. Today, we have more than 20 opportunities under evaluation. 
With increasing government focus, growing market demand and additional investor interest, we are increasing our emphasis in this area through the establishment of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This new business will continue to progress the ongoing venture work while looking to expand other commercial opportunities from our extensive low-carbon technology portfolio. The business will focus its efforts on solutions critical to achieving the ambitions of the Paris agreement, work with governments around the world to promote the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and partner with interested parties to achieve improvements at scale. 
While new, this business will hit the ground running, incorporating the existing venture organization and a healthy pipeline of potential opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information as this effort advances. 
Before we open the lines for your questions, let me close by reiterating our areas of focus: delivering world-class safety and reliability, driving structural cost reductions, advancing a flexible portfolio of high-return cost advantage investments, maintaining the strong dividend and fortified balance sheet and reducing emissions while developing needed technologies to support the ambitions of the Paris agreement. 
Our people delivered in these areas last year, despite the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. I am absolutely confident they will deliver even more this year and into the future. 
I hope I've given you a deeper understanding of our strategy and plans for 2021 and beyond. I look forward to providing you with more detail during our March Investor Day and as the year progresses. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And as you guys have posted further progress on restructuring exploration and environmental plans, too, we did have some industry help along the way. But on this point, it seems like you're pretty encouraged about the outperformance that you've seen on the structural efficiency component that you talked about earlier today and that divestitures, which are another part of the capital management program probably will recover, but in a better price environment. 
So my question is whether or not you agree with my characterizations of these 2 items? And also whether or not you have any additional color or specifics on these parts of the capital management program, which make you optimistic about performance in those areas?"

And before I answer that, let me just take a minute to congratulate you on your pending retirement. Well-earned. I'll miss having you in the mix. 
With respect to your comment and the delivery of some of the improvements we've made, I just maybe step back and provide a little perspective on the journey we've been on. As we looked at the business and focus on the opportunities to improve performance over time, we recognize the need as a capital-intensive industry to make sure that we had a very healthy and attractive set of capital investment opportunities, which is what we focused on in the beginning to recognize the size of that opportunity and the leverage that it gives us with respect to earnings and cash flow. And so as you heard early on with my tenure, that's what I was focused. We generated a very, very attractive set of investments. At the same time, we were progressing an organizational restructuring to move from this functional organization that we had put in place at the time with the merger of Exxon and Mobil, which served its purposes and added a lot of value at the time as we brought those 2 companies together. But with time, recognize the need to to an organization that had a better line of sight end-to-end on the business and a more direct accountability for profit and loss. And we completed that transition in 2019. And I think last year in the March analyst meeting, I mentioned that we were focused on taking advantage of the new organization to drive efficiencies. 
And I would say 2020 delivered on that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see more opportunity down the road and have actually built into our plans from 2020 these improved efficiency. So that's what I would tell you is the foundation of the plan that we've got and the improvement opportunities that we see going forward, independent of where the market takes us. 
Then on top of that, obviously, and as we said back in our third quarter call with where the impact of the pandemic and the price response to the loss of economic activity, we recognize that, that had to be a temporary downturn just because of the fundamentals associated with the industry, and wanted to make sure that we prepared ourselves for what would be an eventual recovery, recognizing the timing of that is somewhat uncertain. 
And I would say, as we sit here today, I would still characterize it as somewhat uncertain, although encouraging here over the last several months. But we haven't -- we're not kind of taking that to the bank, so to speak. We're prepared and keeping an eye on how the market develops and will respond accordingly. 
So I feel good about where we're at today. I think we've got our company in a position and our organization focused on the right things, and then we've got an opportunity set with flexibility that we can execute as we go forward. 
And as I said, as I look at the first quarter, we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be, and we'll already start to delever and continue to progress our investments. So I feel as good as you can given some of the uncertainty out there with the residual pandemic effects."

I think as you saw last year and we've been talking about, we're really trying to focus the activity on the highest value, highest return, lowest cost of capital, which has meant prioritizing investments and high-grading the portfolio. 
So we announced a divestment program, something that we hadn't historically not done, and have been out prosecuting that divestment program. We've got assets in the market today. But as we said at the time we announced it and continues to be the underlying principle associated with our divestment program is it's a value-driven program. So we're looking to make sure that we can find a buyer that values the asset sees more opportunity than we can prosecute with the asset. And so that is what drives the decision. 
Obviously, last year with all the uncertainty, there wasn't a whole lot of activity in this space, although we did make some progress. We have mechanisms with respect to the deals that can accommodate some of the price uncertainty. And that's going to continue on. I would say, as the market recovers and people's views develop more fully, I expect we'll have additional advancements in that program."

We look at a lot of things in that whole space. We've been active in that for quite some time. We continue to be active to look for opportunities to grow value, unique value. And that's kind of what drives, in our mind, the opportunity. And as you know, we've talked about in the past, having always -- have found opportunities that we felt were valued correctly or valued in line with what would be required to kind of extract unique value through an acquisition or a merger, but we continue to look in that space, and it will be an active program going forward."

What I'd say is last year, clearly, was an unprecedented event, something that forced some dramatic action in the industry as a whole and our company. And as we  leverage the new organization and reconfigured our plans in response to the pandemic and the consequences of that. We changed a lot of things and operating under a new set of constraints, obviously, drawing down our balance sheet to the point that we did require a different approach going forward. And so that was the focus in rebuilding the plans for 2020. 
And as I've said, I think the organization as a whole, responded very, very well to the challenging conditions, not only in operating our businesses in the environment, but at the same time, putting together very thorough, well-thought-out plans for how we would go forward and accommodate the increased uncertainty and the recovery that we knew we had to make coming out of the pandemic. And frankly, as we put those plans together, we recognize that was a change from the past, in our past plans. and wanted to make sure that we effectively communicated that going forward. So we had a very early release at the back end of the year after the Board approved the plans that provided some perspective with the intent of coming into this call and more thoroughly taking the community, the investment community, through more details of that plan. And that's what we've been doing here. 
All the things we've talked about, as you can clearly tell, if you look at the materiality of it and it's work has been in a way for quite some time. And I'd say 2020, a lot of effort by the organization to put those together. And our intent is to make sure that we keep the outside community kind of up-to-date with those plans given the constraints that we're operating under."

Yes. I think -- so we've built the plan based on the 3 capital allocation priorities that I touched on as part of my prepared remarks and try to optimize the value to the corporation, recognizing that if you look at the portfolio and the underlying strategy that we embarked on back in 2017, '18 time frame, that remains in place. The -- even stress testing the projects and the investment opportunities we've had, we have in the portfolio, continue to look attractive in this environment. You saw the upstream portfolio, which is the biggest part of our spend, show that. So our intent then is to kind of pace that investment as we move forward, reflective of the market environments. And we structured the capital program, again, consistent with the experience that we had last year and the drawdown that we had in capital to make sure that we have flexibility to adjust. 
If you think about what we've put in that flexible bucket, there's a large chunk of or a piece of short term, the short-cycle investments in the Permian, where we clearly have flexibility. We've got pace projects or things that are global projects organization as we are working to reoptimize the capital program, think very cost effectively and working with our EPC partners suspended some of that project, but put them in warm standby so that we can start those back up again. That's in our flexible spend. And as I mentioned, we've got some longer-term spend to fill the pipeline early on so that we've got things that we move outside the plan freeze. So all those things are -- we can make decisions in real time about whether we continue progress those or pull back in that area, depending on what the environment is at. 
And because we can do that, and as we've pointed out in the charts that we've shown, we've got lots of flexibility under different price environments to sustain the dividend. So we feel really good about where we're at today, that we've got good upside with respect to growing the cash flow as I've showed, but at the same time, if we need to and the environment dictates, we can pull back. I think that's the optimum position is to develop options have the flexibility to adjust if you need to. 
We're very keen not to pull things back to a point where we didn't have plans to take advantage of the portfolio that we had if the market environment was better than what many were thinking last year. And so our intent was build plans that are as best as possible what the market expects and then be positioned to pull down, if necessary. 
Going in with no plan, trying to ramp up is a lot harder than going in with the plan and coming down."

And I think we have not tried to build plans based on speculating where prices will go. Instead, what we've tried to do is build plans based on what a reasonable assumption is. And when I say reasonable, we test our price basis against kind of third party and where the market -- generally the market is. And our expectation is to be kind of within and certainly on the lower end of the price expectations, and that's how we build the plan. But we recognize when we put that together, that those prices probably aren't going to materialize and could be higher or lower and sort of have flexibility. And I wouldn't read anything into how high we went on that chart. I mean, it was -- it's kind of just -- it was a number that we picked. The higher it goes, the better off, obviously, where we're at. 
And I would tell you, our first priority above and beyond the plan, if we see a price environment that's higher than we have anticipated, it would be to continue to delever and to rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. Because again, I would tell you and as I've talked about today and in the past, balancing across the 3 capital allocation priorities is absolutely critical and you take different decisions in the short term. Last year, where we recognized we were in a very deep downturn, one that we also believe would be temporary, prioritize the dividend and made sure that we continue to pay that and grew on the balance sheet. As we come out of that, which is what we expected, our plan is to rebuild the balance sheet so that we can be in a position going forward to absorb what other shocks come in the future. And at the same time, we wanted to make sure that we are continuing to invest in these accretive projects because ultimately, they are going to underpin the long-term success of the corporation. 
So I'd say the keyword, as we worked through last year, is balance. And I'd say the other one is optionality, flexibility, and that's what the plan now reflects in what we've talked about today."

Well, you can see on the Downstream in that Chart 30, we've put a kind of a January estimate, and there's some kind of where we're at currently, it's still well outside that historic range.

Well, you can see on the Downstream in that Chart 30, we've put a kind of a January estimate, and there's some kind of where we're at currently, it's still well outside that historic range. And so I think today, if you look at the industry as a whole across the globe where margins are at, it's not a sustainable position just because of the losses that are accruing. And if you look back in history, I think there's a certain physics associated with these businesses and say you can only go so low before you're not covering your cost and you're bleeding cash, and so you're going to have to make adjustments. And that historical range, in my mind, kind of sets those limits. I mean these are commodity businesses. And if you take a price that goes below the marginal cost of supply, it's going to end up costing industry as a whole, and eventually, players will rationalize and drop out. 
And that -- for as long as I've been in the downstream, that business has been long supply, and it's a slow process to rationalize type, particularly as more refineries come on out in Asia. So I think it's just -- what you're seeing there is the time cycle associated with rebalancing the markets and the supply-demand balance. And obviously, demand is off pretty significantly, what was already a kind of marginally long business. So it will be a function of demand coming back and how quickly that recovers and then rationalization. 
As Stephen said, we've seen last year much higher levels of rationalization. And my expectation would be if we don't see the margins recover back to within that band, that you'll continue to see that."

I think it's -- there's a mixed view. And we've tried to be pretty conservative in our planning, just recognizing the mechanisms required to rebalance the market. That's going to take time. 
My expectation is the second half of the year will look a lot better than the first half. But exactly where we end up on that bar, I think it's tough to tell. I think eventually, we'll get back there, if not back into this year, sometime into next year and potentially see an overcorrection, so to speak, as demand continues to pick up. And with the reduced supply, we'll see that tightness in the supply/demand market play itself out in the downstream is what I would expect.  
The challenge with all these things. I'm talking about very fundamental things. It's not a question of if that's going to happen, but when. And I think that's, I think, the trick in this game and our view is should recognize it's coming but not build a plan based on the hope that it does."

Or are you able to describe some of the steps that have to happen, both technologically and regulatory fiscally to get us from where we are now to something that looks like a genuine business opportunity? 
And the second question, if I asked the follow-up as well at the same time, in CapEx, is it fair to characterize the level of CapEx that you need to address 1 of those 3 objectives that you had, which is to sustain the dividend over the very long term that CapEx needs to be in that 21 to 25 and the current level of spend that you're projecting for '21 is more around about protecting the balance sheet and therefore, not a sustainable level of CapEx in the long term, consistent with your payout?"

Sure, Jon. So on the CCS, I think and as I indicated and as I've talked, I think, for as long as I've been publicly speaking about this is we've recognized that carbon capture storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of the Paris agreement. And one of the things that we've noticed over time is -- and I think the IEA described it as momentum in this space is that we're beginning to see a broader recognition of the importance of that technology. I think the industry for a long time is recognized. But I think more broadly, it's being recognized as an important part of the solution set in terms of achieving ambitions of the Paris agreement. 
So we've been working for quite some time on the technology and trying to address the cost side of that, to find a technology that was lower in cost, which would then make opportunities more attractive and accelerate the deployment of CCS. And so a lot of work over the years on the -- what I'd say is the fundamental process technology and the way they can actually concentrate CO2. 
And as we look at that portfolio, we've been advancing, there's more work to be done there for sure. There's still technology developments that we've got to progress. But we're now seeing, I think, with the increased recognition of the need for this technology, governments being more amenable to an understanding and recognizing the need for policy frameworks and regulatory frameworks, legal frameworks to support establishing CCS. We're seeing investor demand where people are interested in investing in those types of projects. So I think there's money that's looking for opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. And then there's a market growing for reduction credits. We see a lot of things, a lot of market developments and momentum in the market as a whole, which all contribute to building a sustainable business. And so we felt like, given where things evolve, to announce the time to bring a more concerted effort in this space and start making sure that we're staffed and we've got people working hard, engaging with governments to help move all those things along. 
If you look at that portfolio of products that we've got today, one of the biggest challenges in the policy and regulatory framework space. And so that's a real focus area. I think certainly here in the U.S., we've got an administration that's interested in progressing in this space, and we're there ready to talk with them and help provide some perspective from an industry standpoint. 
We think the timing is right, and we think we've got -- we put the right people in this new organization to kind of move that forward. But it will be -- I think this is a complex area. There are a lot of variables at play that we've got to bring together, and we need to make sure that we've got our senior management focused on bringing those things together. 
On your CapEx -- 2021 CapEx, you're right. That is a low CapEx number for us. In fact, if you look at the history and going back in time since Exxon and Mobil merged is the lowest level of capital spend that we've had in any year. And so I think it's fair to say, just using history as a guide that that's probably not a sustainable level of CapEx. And it is a response to the environment that we found ourselves and the recovery that we're making coming out of that environment. And I think longer term going forward, which is one of the reasons why our 2022  through 2025 range and guidance is higher is just a recognition that in a more steady-state environment, the spend needs to be higher to support kind of the growth and to underpin the capital allocation."

We certainly see that there in gas. And we see opportunities from a -- in terms of recycling or an environmentally improved footprint in the Chemical business as well. So I think that, as I mentioned, the momentum that we're seeing broadly in this space is opening up market opportunities, which we think this business can take -- engaged with and make sure that we are contributing where we can. 
I mentioned these -- to make a difference and move the needle, there needs to be fairly broad investment over time. And we have a lot of capabilities that lend itself to that. Not only do we have the technology work that we've been doing. We've got a project organization that knows how to scale up technologies and apply them. We have a manufacturing footprint that we can take advantage of. We've got a very good understanding of subsurface and how that works. We've got midstreams and pipelines. 
We -- if you look at the different elements that have to go in to successfully building a CCS business, it's very consistent with what we do today and very much in our wheelhouse. So we see that as an opportunity. And frankly, the challenge has been the development of the market and the needs here. And again, as we see the momentum in that grow, we see that opportunity. So I think that's the work and what we're focused on doing here."

I would tell you, Sam, this is the year that we will do that with this business. We'll give Joe a chance to get in the chair and then get his organization focused on marketing and business plan and then translating that into our company plan process. And then at the end of the year, we'll have -- we'll start to kind of track it like we do all the other businesses. And so I'd say that's a question that we'll answer as we go forward and look at these opportunities. 
I mean a big variable in all this is just there's a lot of things that have to come together to make these things move and progress. And so part of it is a function of how that external market moves, part of it is a function of how quickly the governments respond and put in the right kind of regulatory and policy frameworks. And so I think it's a complicated space, but it's one that's very consistent with what we've historically done. And so I feel pretty optimistic that we can come in and contribute and actually help in the space, and it's very consistent with our competencies and capabilities. And so this is the space that we feel like where we can contribute and help society reduce their emission. 
So -- but I would say stay tuned. There's a lot of work that has to happen here. And as we develop that, we'll be sharing with you how we see that -- the potential here and how these opportunities are developing.

I would say -- so we've got -- we've had a very active technology portfolio across this whole space. You may recall in the past, I've talked about our energy centers we've got around the world where we've partnered with universities, very focused on investing in areas where we see the potential for alternatives. Biofuels is an area where we've got a number of different technology drives for -- to see if we can develop more cost-effective biofuels that work at scale. 
A lot of work in process technology and how we take existing processes and make them more energy-efficient, less emissions associated with them. So trying to leverage some of the new materials that are out there. There's a lot -- I'd say we've got a really broad spectrum of opportunity we've been working on. 
We've got relationships with 80 universities where we're not necessarily steering that technology work, but we are participating in it. And as we see those technologies advance and look and get higher potential, have a higher potential of those things, we would look to try to bring into the portfolio. So we've got -- what I'd say, we've cast a pretty wide net around the technology space, recognizing that it's requiring some level of evolution, if not breakthroughs and technologies for them to be successful. And so since you can't really plan for that, we kind of keep a finger on the pulse of a lot of different technologies with the intent then to, as they look more promising, to bring them into the emerging and then commercial technology space. And so that's the work that this new group will be focused on. 
And again, it's -- we'll complement what we're doing in the carbon capture and storage. We've got the biofuel work that we've been doing, and we've got the process technology work doing. And a lot of those things overlap with one another. 
Certainly -- and of course, that then also has hydrogen and the process technology work we're doing and the CCS work together have a lot of overlap with potential for hydrogen generation So I'd say that's the space that we tend to be working on from a technology standpoint. 
And then with respect to the spend, this is a long-term focus area for our facilities and businesses. And you can see from the progress we've made with reducing greenhouse gases, it's not something new. It's something we've been after year after year after year. And those opportunities continue to present themselves. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that with the new organization and the new processes that we've put in place, we've got more direct and better line of sight to those opportunities so that we can make sure they're getting funded and moving forward, and that's all built into our plans, and it built into our 2025 objectives that we've laid out."

As we think about just the capital spending range over the next several years, the $20 billion to $25 billion and contextualize that with the analysis that you had in the slides on the amount of cash flow contribution in 2025 from some of the new projects coming online, I was wondering if you could just help us pinpoint, what level of spend you think is required in order to just hold cash flow across the business flat over a multiyear period, understanding it's kind of higher than the 2021 spend, somewhere within that $20 billion to $25 billion. Any way we can fine tune that estimate a little bit in terms of the maintenance CapEx, the whole cash flow steady?"

Well, I think the way we tend to look at it is how do you maximize the value. And we don't have an objective of trying to hold volumes or any other metric it comes back to if what are the projects that we have available to us, the investments, what are the returns that we think we can generate from those investments, what advantage do they have versus industry and within our own portfolio, how robust are they to the price environment. So I would say that, as we look to build up our investment profile, it's understanding what the value of those investments are and then putting those in the context of the constrains that we're operating under to see which ones get funded and how we prioritize them. 
So I would say in 2020, one of the things, given the impacts of coronavirus and draw on our balance sheet, is we really prioritized and focused on the highest value first. We've still got a really deep portfolio that we'll continue to advance as the circumstances allow and as the market allows, and that's how we're going to kind of go forward. 
And that range that we've given in the outer years is indicative of what we think it would be required to continue to fund that very attractive set of investments. Again, I'll come back to, though, if the market and the price environment is not supportive of that, that will be a constraint that continues to moderate that capital. And as I've shown -- I showed on the chart, we've got lots of flexibility, particularly as you move out into the outer years to pull back if we feel like that's the best thing to do given the environment that we find ourselves in, make sure we continue to pay a very strong dividend and maintain a balance sheet that's going to allow us to ride through the cycles and continue to invest. Those are the 3 things. 
And I would just say there's no hard formula. It's responding to the current circumstances and making sure that we're striking the right balance because each of those plays a really important part in the value proposition for the corporation."

After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives on 2020 and updates on our priorities and plans for 2021 and beyond. Following those remarks, Darren and I will be happy to address questions.
Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation.
I'll now highlight developments since the third quarter of this year on the next slide. In the Upstream, gas realizations increased by approximately 40%, with demand and prices recovering from lows earlier in 2020, reflecting the impact of supply disruptions, colder weather and crude-linked LNG pricing. Liquids realizations were essentially flat with the third quarter with low October prices improving as the quarter progressed.
While there were no economic curtailments in the quarter, government-mandated curtailments increased to approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, the Upstream business matched its best ever reliability performance for the year.
We continue to progress active exploration programs in Guyana and Brazil and in the fourth quarter, announced a hydrocarbon discovery in Suriname, which extends ExxonMobil's resource position in South America. In the Downstream, we achieved the best-ever personnel and process safety as well as record reliability performance for the year.
Industry refining margins remained at historic lows, driving industry rationalization with 4x the 10-year average level of capacity reductions announced in 2020. With continuing weak margins, we expect further industry closures.
The Chemical business matched the strong operational performance of the Upstream and Downstream, also achieving best-ever annual safety and reliability performance. This excellent performance enabled us to fully capture the improving margins driven by sustained strength in packaging and continued recovery in automotive and durable product markets.
Across the corporation, we exceeded the operating cost and CapEx reduction targets that we laid out in April. We decisively responded to the unprecedented market conditions in 2020. Leveraging our global projects organization, we were able to defer spend and optimize projects to preserve the long-term value of our industry-leading investment portfolio.
Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of fourth quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of fourth quarter results relative to the third quarter. Starting with third quarter 2020, the reported loss of $700 million included favorable identified items of $100 million, driven by the noncash inventory adjustments we noted in the third quarter. Excluding these items, the third quarter loss was $800 million.
Fourth quarter results were a loss of $20.1 billion, including $20.2 billion of identified items related to impairments. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $100 million, a $900 million improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter results were $200 million lower than the third quarter due to mark-to-market impacts on unsettled derivatives. This reflects the impact of marking-to-market open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy has not closed at the end of the quarter. We expect to realize the full earnings of these trading strategies when they close in the future.
Improvements in upstream, natural gas and LNG prices as well as increased liquids production in Guyana also benefited earnings. Continued strong demand for high-value chemical performance products, coupled with the strong reliability, supported Chemical earnings improvement of $200 million.
Finally, as a result of the growing strength of our portfolio, we removed less strategic assets from our development plans, including certain dry gas resources, notably in North America. This resulted in a noncash after-tax impairment charge of about $19 billion.
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items.
Moving to Slide 5. Improved prices and margins in the Upstream and Chemical increased earnings by $530 million. The benefit of higher Upstream liquids production in Guyana, Canada and the U.S. also improved earnings. This was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of planned turnaround, maintenance and exploration activity.
In the Downstream and Chemical, our integrated manufacturing sites allowed us to rapidly respond to dynamic market conditions and capture significant feedstock benefits. For example, we optimized units that typically produce gasoline to increased production of high-value chemical feedstocks, critical to the manufacturing of gowns, mask and hand sanitizer. Manufacturing results in the Downstream were improved with strong reliability and investments at high-grade product yields contributing $160 million to the fourth quarter earnings.
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of the full year results. Slide 6 is a comparison of full year 2020 results relative to 2019. Results reflected the unprecedented loss in demand driven by the economic impact of COVID, which in turn significantly depress Upstream and Downstream margins. In responding to pandemic-related challenges, the organization rapidly reduced costs, achieving $3 billion in structural savings out of a total reduction of $8 billion. Our manufacturing facilities contributed an additional $1 billion with better reliability and improved product yields.
Moving to upstream volumes on Slide 7. Upstream volumes decreased by an average of approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2019. Volumes were impacted by economic and government-mandated curtailments as well as Groningen production limits, which in total reduced volumes by approximately 210,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Excluding the impact of economic and government-mandated curtailments, entitlements, Groningen production limits and divestments, volumes increased by about 110,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. This was in line with our original production plans with optimization of maintenance activity reducing the impact of economic curtailments.
Moving to Slide 8. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15% and CapEx by 30%. We exceeded these reduction targets. Looking at capital spending, we established reductions of 30%. The reorganization of our Upstream and Downstream businesses a couple of years ago enabled us to accelerate the efficiency capture that we expected from these changes.
Cash operating expenses were down $8 billion versus 2019, including structural reductions of about $3 billion that were delivered through optimization of supply chains and logistics, work process simplification and workforce reductions. We leveraged our new global projects organization and strong relationships with EPCs to adjust our capital plan, deferring spend and further optimizing projects. This allowed us to reduce quarterly spend by $2 billion in the second quarter versus the first quarter, a 25% reduction.
As we continue this work through the year, we reduced capital expenditures by $10 billion or greater than 30% versus 2019 in the original plan. Importantly, we did this while improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operation.
Let's turn to the next page, where you can see the impact of these reductions on our cash profile. Excluding the impact of working capital effects, fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $600 million from the third quarter. Gross debt decreased by about $1.2 billion to $67.6 billion. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion of cash, a little above our minimum operating levels.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll cover a few key considerations for the first quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels from the fourth quarter. Production is expected to be higher in the first quarter due to seasonal gas demand.
In the Downstream, we anticipate higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds to be offset by additional efficiencies. In Chemical, we anticipate continued demand resilience across packaging, hygiene and medical segments with continuing recovery in automotive and construction markets. Scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter. Corporate and finance expenses are anticipated to be about $700 million.
Lastly, at current crude prices and Downstream and Chemical margins, we expect cash flow from operating activities to cover the dividend and our planned CapEx, which has flexibility to adjust depending on the business environment.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Darren."

It's good to be on the call. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. I'm sure I'm like many of you, happy to close the book on 2020 and optimistic for the year ahead.
As you know, the pandemic has had devastating impacts on people and businesses around the world. These effects were especially severe in our industry. Energy consumption collapsed as economy shut down. Oil prices hit their lowest point in history, and refining margins fell well below their 10-year lows. It was the first time in memory that we saw simultaneous lows in each of our businesses.
As I discussed a year ago, our response throughout these challenging times was primarily focused on 3 areas: protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to support COVID response efforts, providing critical energy and products and aggressively reducing spend while preserving value to ensure we remain in the best possible position for the eventual recovery.
We're pleased with how we performed on each of these. Our employees stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products from hand sanitizer to specialty products for protective equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts, we kept operations running 24/7 while achieving strong safety results and exceptional reliability performance. At the same time, we leveraged on the ongoing work in reorganizing our Upstream and Downstream businesses to significantly reduce cost and preserve value in an extremely challenging and uncertain market environment.
We delivered on our cost reduction objectives and outperformed our revised plan, which we shared with you in April. Going forward, we're continuing to work to reduce cost by leveraging synergies from aligned organizations and work processes across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. Further opportunities are being identified to reduce cost to drive cash flow and maintain our capital allocation priorities, including paying a strong dividend and maintaining a fortified balance sheet that we deleverage over time.
I'll provide more detail momentarily on the successful efforts to drive greater efficiency across our businesses and further improve our cost structure. I'll also spend time discussing the significant steps we're taking to reduce emissions intensity and absolute emissions and our work to advance lower-emission technologies, like our newly announced Low Carbon Solutions business. Collectively, this will help position us as an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance while helping society move to a lower carbon future.
Let me start, though, by highlighting a few notable achievements from 2020 in what was a very difficult business environment. During a year of unprecedented challenges, our people successfully managed our global operations, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products while achieving best-ever safety and reliability performance.
We reduced cash operating expenses by more than 15%, including $3 billion of structural improvements and reduced capital investments by more than 30% to $21 billion without compromising the advantages or value of our projects. We achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals for both methane and flaring and established new plans for 2025 that are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These plans are expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.
Permian Basin volumes exceeded our plan at 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day despite curtailments and reduced investment. This performance was driven by significant ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and technology development. We progressed Liza Phase 2 and Payara developments in Guyana and continued our exploration success with 3 new discoveries, increasing the recoverable resource estimate on the Stabroek block to nearly 9 billion oil equivalent barrels.
Our Chemical business set a new record for polyethylene sales, reflecting the growth in demand for performance packaging and strong operating performance of our expanding asset fleet. We maintained our position as a global leader in carbon capture, one we've held for more than 30 years, by increasing sequester CO2 to more than 120 million tons. This is well over twice the next closest competitor and larger than the next 5 competitors combined. To put this in perspective, 120 million tons is equivalent to taking more than 25 million passenger vehicles off the road in a year.
In 2020, we focused on managing through the impacts of an unprecedented industry environment, leveraging the strengths of our corporation to progress an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities critical to the long-term success of the company. At the same time, we drove deep structural efficiencies to improve competitiveness and position ourselves amongst the industry's lowest cost of supply.
Let me start with our efficiencies. You may recall that in 2019, we completed our corporate reorganizations, moving from functional companies to businesses organized along their value chains. This allowed us to reduce overhead and provided end-to-end oversight for each business, which was a critical first step in streamlining the businesses to structurally reduce cost. It also allowed us to more effectively prioritize work and focus on the highest-value activities.
Consistent organizations across each sector are allowing us to consolidate like activities to fully leverage the corporation's scale, further reducing cost and improving effectiveness. Our global products organization was established in 2019 as a result of this approach. This organization has played a critical role in reoptimizing our global investment portfolio, improving the capital efficiency of each project and when necessary, cost effectively deferring work.
As we came into 2020 in the pandemic, the organization changes provided the foundation for significantly reducing spend across the businesses. Expense results are shown in this chart, which is consistent with the chart Stephen showed, excluding production taxes and energy expenses that are a function of commodity price. As you can see, 60% of the $5 billion reduction from 2019 to 2020 was structural, driven by reduced overheads and operational efficiencies. The remaining reductions were temporary, driven by lower production and activity deferrals.
During last year's planning process, each organization identified opportunities to convert the short-term or temporary expense reductions and to permanent structural efficiencies. This year, we expect to achieve a further $1 billion of structural efficiencies. By 2023, we will achieve a total of $6 billion in structural expense reductions versus 2019. I expect even further reductions as we take advantage of additional synergies unlocked by consistently organized businesses.
One final point to make on this slide. The structural reductions we've shown are independent of the price environment we find ourselves in. On the other hand, returning activity and increased expenses between 2020 and 2023 are in large part a function of the price environment. In lower price environments, much of that increase would be further deferred.
Let me now turn to another critical area, our capital investments. Over the past several years, we have been progressing a strategy to high-grade our asset base and improve the earnings and cash generation potential of our businesses. We announced work to divest less strategic assets and have been progressing a portfolio of industry-leading investments. With pandemic-driven losses, we responded quickly to bring capital spending in line with market conditions and an uncertain outlook and preserve our strong dividend.
As we enter 2021, our capital plan is at a historic low, significantly reduced from 2020 levels. Our capital plans through 2025 reflect 3 key themes: value, flexibility and discipline. Value derived from advancing our highest return; cash flow accretive projects to deliver increased earnings and cash, both near and long term; flexibility to respond to a dynamic market, we demonstrated this in 2020 and have developed our plans with this in mind; and discipline to make adjustments to our capital program depending on market conditions to support a strong dividend and begin to delever.
Our plans are built on a price basis consistent with third-party outlooks and advance our highest return investments. We maintain a healthy balance sheet and our strong dividend. They are robust to a wide range of price scenarios and using last year's experience and flexibility to respond to lower price environments.  
In each plan year, we have a level of short-cycle unconventional spend, which can be reduced in line with market conditions. We also expect to restart projects that have been suspended across this time horizon, but if necessary, can be delayed longer, further deferring spend. We also have a level of early investments that fund long-term growth opportunities. These, too, can be deferred or suspended.
While each of these reductions impact the value of our plan that are available as circumstances warrant, less flexible spend can also be reduced but at a higher cost. This capital is generally longer cycle, more firmly committed or very near completion.
The next slide helps quantify our capital flexibility. On the left of this graphic, we show available cash from operations for our 2021 plan at different Brent prices, assuming the lowest refining and chemical margins experienced from 2010 to 2019. This is our source, with higher crude prices generating more available cash.
As you move right, you see our uses: the current dividend and our 2021 CapEx from the previous page. As you can see, the breakeven Brent price needed to pay our dividend and invest in the low end of our flexible capital is roughly $45 a barrel. The Brent price required for $16 billion, which is the low end of our guidance and closer to where I expect our actual spend to be in 2021, is $50 a barrel.
With Downstream and Chemical margins at the bottom of the 10-year historical range, we can fund our highest-return investments in Guyana, the Permian and the Chemical business and begin paying down debt at Brent prices just above $50 a barrel. If Downstream and Chemical margins were at their 10-year averages, Brent breakeven prices would be roughly $5 a barrel lower, which would allow us to fund investments, pay the dividend and pay down debt at Brent prices above $45 a barrel.
As we look at the market year-to-date, actual prices and margins in total are above our plan, allowing us to progress our investments, pay the dividend and begin paying down debt in the first quarter. Obviously, we are very early into the year and we know the market will change. We're keeping a close eye on developments and will adjust our capital spend accordingly, protecting the strong dividend and preserving the balance sheet.
Let's shift to a later year in our plan 2025. By 2025, we expect Downstream and Chemical margins to be off their lows and closer to a long-term average. In this case, we used the average margins from 2010 to 2019. In addition, we will see the full benefits of the structural OpEx improvements and additional cash from the projects that come online by 2025.
As you can see, there is substantially more flexibility in our capital spend. As a result, our plans continue to cover the dividend and capital investments at Brent prices as low as $35 a barrel. At Brent prices above $50 a barrel, our capital allocation framework supports our planned investments, further debt reduction and/or shareholder distributions.
So as you can see, our plans are robust to a wide range of price environments. And while we are optimistic that the recent improvements in the macro environment will continue, we recognize that much could change over the next 4 to 5 years. If we face a year where Brent prices remain below $50 a barrel on a sustained basis, we would reduce investments to levels more consistent with this year's plan.
Recognizing the market uncertainty, we've attempted to strike the right balance between maintaining a strong dividend, fortifying the balance sheet to delever and continuing to invest in high-return cash-accretive projects. This last point is critical, particularly in a depletion business. The next chart gives a good perspective of this.
Our investment strategy is focused on growing earnings and cash flow across a wide range of market environments. We are investing in advantaged projects with some of the industry's lowest cost of supply. They grow earnings and cash flow in a variety of market environments. This graphic helps to illustrate this.
Using IHS crude price and third-party margins, we expect the cash flow from project start-ups over our investment horizon to represent roughly 40% of our operating cash flow in 2025. This makes a critical point. You pay a significant long-term cost for excessive short-term investment reductions. When industry does it collectively, the market pays with much higher commodity prices, striking the right balance, responding to short-term constraints with an eye on the mid to long term, generates the greatest value.
Of course, an investment portfolio of industry advantaged projects is critical. The next slide provides a perspective of the investments we are making in developing upstream resources, which represents the majority of our Upstream capital spend.
This chart graphs cumulative Upstream capital spend to develop resources from 2021 through 2025 against the Brent price required for the investment to generate a 10% return, which we deemed our cost of supply. As you can see, our focus on high-return, lowest cost of supply investments generate a portfolio with a cost of supply well below $3 a barrel. In fact, almost 90% of our investments in developing upstream resources have a cost of supply of $35 per barrel or less. These investments generate an average return using third-party price outlooks in excess of 30%. 
So as you can see, striking the right balance, progressing a very attractive portfolio of investments while maintaining our strong dividend and fortifying the balance sheet to delever is essential to maximizing value, both near term and long term. When executed in a period where others are pulling back and construction markets are slack, these investments become even more attractive. When you factor in the flexibility of our short-cycle investments in the Permian, where the value proposition continues to grow, we are well positioned. We have an attractive investment portfolio that we can flex with market conditions to strike the right balance across our capital allocation priorities.
Let me now take a few minutes to highlight the progress we've been making in the Permian. Despite challenging additions and a rapid change in activity, our progress in the Permian exceeded our plan and expectations. These improvements reflect the hard work of our people, the organizational changes made in 2019 and the continued evolution of our technology and techniques.
In 2019, we better integrated the experience of our global drilling, technology and project organizations with the unconventional operating organization. Working together, they made a step change in performance that continues to improve.
2020 drilling rates were 50% better than our plan and more than 20% better than full year 2019 results. Drilling and completion costs were 15% below our plan and more than 25% lower than 2019 results. We estimate that roughly 2/3 of the savings were due to improved performance. As an example, the number of frac stages achieved in a day increased by 30% versus 2019.
As we enter 2021, we continue to see progress in our key performance metrics, further growing the value of this resource and improving upon our plans. In 2020, capital expenditures in the Permian were 35% below plan. Despite significant economic curtailments in the second quarter, 2020 volumes of 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day exceeded our plan. We're about 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day above 2019.
Going forward, with the pandemic-related impacts on our balance sheet and market outlook, we are pacing Permian investments to maintain positive free cash flow, deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and achieve double-digit returns at less than $35 a barrel.
Based on the current market price projections, our plans result in Permian volumes of approximately 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by 2025. If demand and prices are lower than current third-party outlooks, we'll adjust our plans. At a nominal Brent price of $50 a barrel through 2025, we would expect to deliver an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2025 versus 2020 production levels.
Key point here is that we have flexibility and options, which I expect to improve with time. We've been making significant progress on our technology programs, which are contributing to current performance. With the advances we are making, I expect continued improvements in productivity, growing volumes at even lower cost. Hopefully, the Permian discussion and broader overview of our investment plans provided a useful perspective on the opportunities we have and the balance we are attempting to strike across our capital allocation priorities amid an uncertain market outlook.
I'd like to move on to the results we've achieved in lowering our emissions and the plans we have for further reductions. But before I do, I'd like to recap some key points. Our portfolio offers the best collection of investment opportunities we've had in over 20 years. They are some of the industry's lowest cost of supply projects with strong returns that are robust to low prices.
Coupled with our expense efficiencies, our capital program through 2025 improves the earnings power and cash generation potential of our asset base in both the near and long term. Leveraging our experience from 2020, we've built flexible plans that will allow us to adjust to market developments and potentially lower prices. If prices move higher than our planned basis, this will allow us to more quickly replenish our balance sheet. Our plans strike the right balance, growing value, maintaining a strong dividend and a fortified balance sheet that is delevered over time.
Let's turn to our work in positioning the company for a lower carbon energy future. Addressing the risk of climate change is one of society's biggest challenges, requiring the combined effort and collaboration of governments, academia, businesses and consumers. ExxonMobil has spent decades researching new technologies and deploying existing ones to lower our emissions and the emissions of our customers. Today, we remain committed to this with plans to position ExxonMobil as a leader in our industry.
Since its inception, we have supported the goals of the Paris Agreement, engaging in climate-related policies and supporting a tax on carbon. Since 2016, the year of the Paris Agreement, we've reduced our operating greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Last year, we met the reduction objectives we set in 2018 and in the fourth quarter, announced new emission reduction plans for 2025 that are consistent with the goals of Paris.
Our plan is to reduce emissions from operated assets and align the company with the World Bank's initiative to eliminate routine flaring, to reduce the intensity of our operated upstream and greenhouse gas emissions. They drive a decrease in methane intensity and a decrease in flaring intensity. This is expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% and absolute methane and flaring emissions by 40% to 50% versus 2016 levels.
Our plans continue to invest in lower emissions initiatives with an expected spend of more than $500 million a year. This includes energy efficiency, CCS investments, cogeneration, research and development and renewable purchases, an area where we already make a significant contribution.
Today, we are the second largest buyer of wind and solar power in the oil and gas industry and among the top 5% across all corporations, purchasing roughly 600 megawatts. While we don't bring a significant competitive advantage to many wind and solar projects, we can leverage our size to support world-scale developments with purchase contracts, helping to ensure they are built.
We're also the world's leader in carbon capture, responsible for over 40% of the CO2 captured. To put this into context, the Nature Conservatory announced a campaign in 2008 to plant 1 billion trees. Our cumulative CO2 capture is more than double that goal.
We are also one of the world's largest producers of hydrogen. As the potential for this and the energy transition develops, we are well positioned to leverage our experience, scale and technology to contribute. In fact, to ensure that we effectively leverage all of our technologies, experiences and expertise, yesterday, we announced the formation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This business will focus on advancing commercial CCS opportunities and deploying emerging technologies as they mature. I'll come back to our plans for this in a moment as we expect it to underpin our long-term strategy in driving emission reductions. I want to first focus on the progress we've already made.
As you can see on this chart, since the inception of the Paris Agreement, ExxonMobil has made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, down 6%, significantly outpacing the progress made by society as a whole. Over the past 20 years, we have invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower emissions energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations. During that time, we eliminated or avoided about 480 million tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 100 million cars.
The plans we announced in December further reduced the intensity of our businesses, delivering an expected reduction in emissions of roughly 12% by 2025. I want to pause here for a minute and emphasize that these are not targets. These reductions are built into our base plans. In conjunction with the reorganizations completed in 2019, we established a more rigorous process to capture emission reduction efforts at operating units around the world. Plans developed in 2020 leverage this process and built in additional efficiency steps and accretive investments to deliver these reductions. Like other planned objectives, the performance of our businesses and our senior management will be evaluated based on achieving these commitments.
I think it's important to point out that our plans are in line with the stated ambitions of the Paris agreement, which you can see on the next chart. This slide overlays both global and ExxonMobil emissions since 2016 with the goals of the Paris Agreement, hypothetical 1.5-degree and 2-degree Celsius pathways. As you can see, our plans are consistent with the stated ambitions.
Of course, the challenge will be maintaining our progress into the future for both ExxonMobil and society at large. Today, the set of solutions available in overcoming this challenge is incomplete. There's a gap between what is needed and what is available. This is illustrated by the 2016 Paris submissions shown by the green diamond, which is an estimate of the signatories' nationally determined contributions.
We are working to close this gap and help provide solutions for society. Our investment in R&D is focused on the world's highest emitting sectors, manufacturing, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for 80% of global energy-related carbon emissions and where today's alternatives are insufficient.
As I said earlier, through 2025, we expect to invest more than $3 billion in lower emissions initiatives, which include energy-efficient process technology, advanced biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, which is a crucial technology for achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Carbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in addressing emissions from difficult to decarbonize sectors. It is also generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions. In the 2-degree scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is estimated that in 2040, 10% of total energy will require CCS. It's also estimated that 15% of global emissions will be mitigated by CCS.
If carbon capture and storage does not progress and play a significant role in decarbonizing the economy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that society's cost of achieving a 2-degree outcome would more than double, increasing the cost by 138%. In short, the world is unlikely to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement without focused action and innovation in carbon capture and storage.
Unfortunately, according to the IEA, its development and deployment are not on track. This is an area where we can potentially leverage unique capabilities to make a difference. Exxon Mobil has been the global leader in carbon capture for more than 30 years. We believe there's an opportunity to leverage our deep operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution skills, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology to uniquely contribute in this area.
In 2018, we formed a carbon capture venture to identify and develop potential CCS opportunities using both established and emerging technologies. This group has been working with governments, industry, academia and tech companies to advance projects. Today, we have more than 20 opportunities under evaluation.
With increasing government focus, growing market demand and additional investor interest, we are increasing our emphasis in this area through the establishment of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This new business will continue to progress the ongoing venture work while looking to expand other commercial opportunities from our extensive low-carbon technology portfolio. The business will focus its efforts on solutions critical to achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, work with governments around the world to promote the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and partner with interested parties to achieve improvements at scale.
While new, this business will hit the ground running, incorporating the existing venture organization and a healthy pipeline of potential opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information as this effort advances.
Before we open the lines for your questions, let me close by reiterating our areas of focus: delivering world-class safety and reliability; driving structural cost reductions; advancing a flexible portfolio of high-return, cost-advantaged investments; maintaining the strong dividend and fortified balance sheet and reducing emissions while developing needed technologies to support the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Our people delivered in these areas last year despite the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. I am absolutely confident they will deliver even more this year and into the future.
I hope I've given you a deeper understanding of our strategy and plans for 2021 and beyond. I look forward to providing you with more detail during our March Investor Day and as the year progresses. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

But on this point, it seems like you're pretty encouraged about the outperformance that you've seen on the structural efficiency component that you talked about earlier today and that divestitures, which are another part of the capital management program, probably recover but in a better price environment.
So my question is whether or not you agree with my characterizations of these 2 items and also whether or not you have any additional color or specifics on these parts of the capital management program, which make you optimistic about performance in those areas."

And before I answer that, let me just take a minute to congratulate you on your pending retirement, well-earned. I miss having you in the mix.
But with respect to your comment and the delivery of some of the improvements we've made, I'd just maybe step back and provide a little perspective on the journey we've been on. As we looked at the business and focused on the opportunities to improve performance over time, we recognize the need as a capital-intensive industry to make sure that we had a very healthy and attractive set of capital investment opportunities, which is what we focused on in the beginning to recognize the size of that opportunity and the leverage that it gives us with respect to earnings and cash flow.
And so as you heard early on with my tenure, that's what I was focused. We generated a very, very attractive set of investments. At the same time, we were progressing an organizational restructuring to move from this functional organization that we had put in place at the time with the merger of Exxon and Mobil, which served its purposes and added a lot of value at the time as we brought those 2 companies together.
But with time, recognize the need to move to an organization that had a better line of sight end to end on the business and a more direct accountability for profit and loss. And we completed that transition in 2019. And I think last year, in the March analyst meeting, I mentioned that we were focused on taking advantage of the new organization to drive efficiencies.
And I would say 2020 delivered on that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see more opportunity down the road and have actually built into our plans from 2020 these improved efficiencies. And so that's what I would tell you is the foundation of the plans that we've got and the improvement opportunities that we see going forward, independent of where the market takes us.
Then on top of that, obviously, and as we said back in our third quarter call, with where -- the impact of the pandemic and the price response to the loss of economic activity, we recognize that, that had to be a temporary downturn just because of the fundamentals associated with the industry, and wanted to make sure that we prepared ourselves for what would be an eventual recovery, recognizing the timing of that is somewhat uncertain.
And I would say, as we sit here today, I would still characterize it as somewhat uncertain, although encouraging here over the last several months. But we haven't -- we're not kind of taking that to the bank, so to speak. We're prepared and keeping an eye on how the market develops and we'll respond accordingly.
So I feel good about where we're at today. I think we've got our company in a position and our organization focused on the right things, and then we've got an opportunity set with flexibility that we can execute as we go forward.
And as I said, as I look at the first quarter, we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be, and we'll already start to delever and continue to progress our investments. So I feel as good as you can given some of the uncertainty out there with the residual pandemic effects."

So we announced a divestment program, something that we hadn't historically not done and have been out prosecuting that divestment program. We've got assets in the market today.
But as we said at the time we announced it, it continues to be -- the underlying principle associated with our divestment program is it's a value-driven program. So we're looking to make sure that we can find a buyer that values the asset, sees more opportunity than we can prosecute with the asset. And so that is what drives the decision.
Obviously, last year, with all the uncertainty, there wasn't a whole lot of activity in this space, although we did make some progress. We have mechanisms with respect to the deals that can accommodate some of the price uncertainty. And that's going to continue on. I would say, as the market recovers and people's views develop more fully, I expect we'll have additional advancements in that program."

What I'd say is last year, clearly, was an unprecedented event, something that forced some dramatic action in the industry as a whole and our company. And as we leverage the new organization and reconfigured our plans in response to the pandemic and the consequences of that, we changed a lot of things and operating under a new set of constraints, obviously, drawing down our balance sheet to the point that we did require a different approach going forward. And so that was the focus in rebuilding the plans for 2020.
And as I've said, I think the organization as a whole responded very, very well to the challenging conditions, not only in operating our businesses in the environment, but at the same time, putting together very thorough, well-thought-out plans for how we would go forward and accommodate the increased uncertainty and the recovery that we knew we had to make coming out of the pandemic.
And frankly, as we put those plans together, we recognize that was a change from the past, in our past plans, and wanted to make sure that we effectively communicated that going forward. So we had a very early release at the back end of the year after the Board approved the plans that provided some perspective with the intent of coming into this call and more thoroughly taking the community, the investment community, through more details of that plan. And that's what we've been doing here.
All the things we've talked about, as you can clearly tell, if you look at the materiality of it and this work has been underway for quite some time. And I'd say 2020, a lot of effort by the organization to put those together. And our intent is to make sure that we keep the outside community kind of up-to-date with those plans given the constraints that we're operating under."

I think -- so we've built the plan based on the 3 capital allocation priorities that I touched on as part of my prepared remarks and try to optimize the value to the corporation, recognizing that if you look at the portfolio and the underlying strategy that we embarked on back in 2017, '18 time frame, that remains in place. The -- even stress-testing the projects and the investment opportunities we've had, we have in the portfolio, continue to look attractive in this environment. You saw the Upstream portfolio, which is the biggest part of our spend, show that.
So our intent then is to kind of pace that investment as we move forward, reflective of the market environments. And we structured the capital program, again, consistent with the experience that we had last year and the drawdown that we had in capital to make sure that we have flexibility to adjust.
If you think about what we've put in that flexible bucket, there's a large chunk of or a piece of short term, the short-cycle investments in the Permian, where we clearly have flexibility. We've got pace projects or things that are global projects organization as we are working to reoptimize the capital program, think very cost effectively and working with our EPC partners, suspended some of that projects but put them in warm standby so that we can start those back up again. That's in our flexible spend.
And as I mentioned, we've got some longer-term spend to fill the pipeline early on so that we've got things that we move outside the [ planned freeze ]. So all those things are kind of -- we can make decisions in real time about whether we continue to progress those or pull back in that area, depending on what the environment is at.
And because we can do that, and as we've pointed out in these charts that we've shown, we've got lots of flexibility under different price environments to sustain the dividend. So we feel really good about where we're at today, that we've got good upside with respect to growing the cash flow as I showed. But at the same time, if we need to and the environment dictates, we can pull back. I think that's the optimum position, is to develop options that have the flexibility to adjust if you need to.
We're very keen not to pull things back to a point where we didn't have plans to take advantage of the portfolio that we had if the market environment was better than what many were thinking last year. And so our intent was build plans that are as best as possible what the market expects and then be positioned to pull down, if necessary. Going in with no plan, trying to ramp up is a lot harder than going in with a plan and coming down."

And I think we have not tried to build plans based on speculating where prices will go. Instead, what we've tried to do is build plans based on what a reasonable assumption is. And when I say reasonable, we test our price basis against kind of third party and where the market -- generally the market is. And our expectation is to be kind of within and certainly on the lower end of the price expectations, and that's how we build the plans.
But we recognize, when we put that together, that those prices probably aren't going to materialize and could be higher or lower and sort of have flexibility. And I wouldn't read anything into how high we went on that chart. I mean it was -- it's kind of just -- it was a number that we picked. The higher it goes, the better off, obviously, where we're at.
And I would tell you, our first priority above and beyond the plan, if we see a price environment that's higher than we have anticipated, it would be to continue to delever and to rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. Because again, I would tell you, and as I've talked about today and in the past, balancing across the 3 capital allocation priorities is absolutely critical and you take different decisions in the short term.
Last year, where we recognized we were in a very deep downturn, one that we also believe would be temporary, prioritize the dividend and made sure that we continue to pay that and grew on the balance sheet. As we come out of that, which is what we expected, our plan is to rebuild the balance sheet so that we can be in a position going forward to absorb what other shocks come in the future. And at the same time, we wanted to make sure that we are continuing to invest in these accretive projects because ultimately, they are going to underpin the long-term success of the corporation.
Now I'd say the keyword, as we worked through last year, is balance. And I'd say the other one is optionality, flexibility, and that's what the plan now reflects in what we've talked about today."

Well, you can see on the Downstream and at Chart 30, we've put kind of a January estimate and they're still kind of where we're at currently, and it's still well outside that historic range.

Well, you can see on the Downstream and at Chart 30, we've put kind of a January estimate and they're still kind of where we're at currently, and it's still well outside that historic range. And so I think today, if you look at the industry as a whole across the globe, where margins are at, it's not a sustainable position just because of the losses that are accruing.
And if you look back in history, I think there's a certain physics associated with these businesses that say you can only go so low before you're not covering your cost and you're bleeding cash, and so you're going to have to make adjustments. And that historical range, in my mind, kind of sets those limits. I mean these are commodity businesses. And if you take a price that goes below the marginal cost of supply, it's going to end up costing industry as a whole and eventually, players will rationalize and drop out.
And that -- for as long as I've been in the Downstream, that business has been long supply, and it's a slow process to rationalize [ a type ], particularly as more refineries come on out in Asia. So I think it's just -- what you're seeing there is the time cycle associated with rebalancing the markets and the supply/demand balance. And obviously, demand is off pretty significantly, what was already a kind of marginally long business. So it will be a function of demand coming back and how quickly that recovers and then continued rationalization. 
As Stephen said, we've seen last year much higher levels of rationalization. And my expectation would be if we don't see the margins recover back to within that band that you'll continue to see that."

I think it's -- there's a mixed view. And we've tried to be pretty conservative in our planning, just recognizing the mechanisms required to rebalance the market. That's going to take time.
My expectation is the second half of the year will look a lot better than the first half. But exactly where we end up on that bar, I think it's tough to tell. I think eventually, we'll get back there, if not back into this year, sometime into next year and potentially see an overcorrection, so to speak, as demand continues to pick up. And with the reduced supply, we'll see that tightness in the supply/demand market play itself out in the downstream is what I would expect.
The challenge with all these things, I'm talking about very fundamental things, it's not a question of if that's going to happen, but when. And I think that's, I think, the trick in this game, and our view is should recognize it's coming but not build a plan based on the hope that it does."

Sure, Jon. So on the CCS, I think, and as I indicated and as I've talked, I think, for as long as I've been publicly speaking about this, is we've recognized that carbon capture storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. And one of the things that we've noticed over time is -- and I think the IEA described it as momentum in this space is that we're beginning to see a broader recognition of the importance of that technology. I think the industry for a long time is recognized. But I think more broadly, it's being recognized as an important part of the solution set in terms of achieving ambitions of the Paris Agreement.
So we've been working for quite some time on the technology and trying to address the cost side of that, to find a technology that was lower in cost, which would then make opportunities more attractive and accelerate the deployment of CCS. And so a lot of work over the years on the -- what I'd say is the fundamental process technology and the way they can actually concentrate CO2.
And as we look at that portfolio we've been advancing, there's more work to be done there for sure. There's still technology developments that we've got to progress. But we're now seeing, I think, with the increased recognition of the need for this technology, governments being more amenable to an understanding and recognizing the need for policy frameworks and regulatory frameworks, legal frameworks to support establishing CCS.
We're seeing investor demand where people are interested in investing in those types of projects. So I think there's money that's looking for opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. And then there's a market growing for reduction credits.
We see a lot of things, a lot of market developments and momentum in the market as a whole, which all contribute to building a sustainable business. And so we felt like, given where things evolve to, now is the time to bring a more concerted effort in this space and start making sure that we're staffed and we've got people working hard, engaging with governments to help move all those things along.
If you look at that portfolio of products that we've got today, one of the biggest challenges in the policy and regulatory framework space, and so that's a real focus area. And I think certainly here in the U.S., we've got an administration that's interested in progressing in this space, and we're there ready to talk with them and help provide some perspective from an industry standpoint.
We think the timing is right, and we think we've got -- we put the right people in this new organization to kind of move that forward. But it will be -- I think this is a complex area. There are a lot of variables at play that we've got to bring together, and we need to make sure that we've got our senior management focused on bringing those things together.
On your CapEx -- 2021 CapEx, you're right. That is a low CapEx number for us. In fact, if you look at the history and going back in time since Exxon and Mobil merged, is the lowest level of capital spend that we've had in any year. And so I think it's fair to say, just using history as a guide, that, that's probably not a sustainable level of CapEx. And it is a response to the environment that we found ourselves and the recovery that we're making coming out of that environment.
And I think longer term going forward -- which is one of the reasons why our 2022 through 2025 range and guidance is higher, is just a recognition that in a more steady-state environment, the spend needs to be higher to support kind of the growth and to underpin the capital allocation priorities we have."

I think the point you make, Sam, was the one maybe I was trying to hit on with Jonathon is this market demand in terms of people looking for cleaner options and offsets and emission reduction steps. And so we think there's an opportunity there with that with many of our -- the products in our portfolio. And we see that across, frankly, all of our sectors, the Downstream. You mentioned gas. We certainly see that there in gas. And we see opportunities from a -- in terms of recycling or an environmentally improved footprint in the Chemical business as well.
So I think that, as I mentioned, the momentum that we're seeing broadly in this space is opening up market opportunities, which we think this business can take -- engage with and make sure that we are contributing where we can. I mentioned these -- to make a difference and move the needle, there needs to be fairly broad investment over time. And we have a lot of capabilities that lend itself to that.
Not only do we have the technology work that we've been doing. We've got a projects organization that knows how to scale up technologies and apply them. We have a manufacturing footprint that we can take advantage of. We've got a very good understanding of subsurface and how that works. We've got midstreams and pipelines.
We -- if you look at the different elements that have to go in to successfully building a CCS business, it's very consistent with what we do today and very much in our wheelhouse. So we see that as an opportunity. And frankly, the challenge has been the development of the market and the needs here. And again, as we see the momentum in that grow, we see that opportunity. And so I think that's the work and what we're focused on doing here."

We'll give Joe a chance to get in the chair and then get his organization focused on marketing and business plan and then translating that into our company plan process. And then at the end of the year, we'll have -- we'll start to kind of track it like we do all the other businesses. And so I'd say that's a question that we'll answer as we go forward and look at these opportunities.
I mean a big variable in all this is just there's a lot of things that have to come together to make these things move and progress. And so part of it is a function of how that external market moves, part of it is a function of how quickly the governments respond and put in the right kind of regulatory and policy frameworks. And so I think it's a complicated space, but it's one that's very consistent with what we've historically done. And so I feel pretty optimistic that we can come in and contribute and actually help in the space, and it's very consistent with our competencies and capabilities.
And so this is the space that we feel like where we can contribute and help society reduce their emissions. So -- but I would say stay tuned. There's a lot of work that has to happen here.

I would say -- so we've got -- we've had a very active technology portfolio across this whole space. You may recall in the past, I've talked about our energy centers we've got around the world where we've partnered with universities, very focused on investing in areas where we see the potential for alternatives. Biofuels is an area where we've got a number of different technology drives for -- to see if we can develop more cost-effective biofuels that work at scale.
A lot of work in process technology and how we take existing processes and make them more energy-efficient, less emissions associated with them. So trying to leverage some of the new materials that are out there. There's a lot -- I'd say we've got a really broad spectrum of opportunities we've been working on.
We've got relationships with 80 universities where we're not necessarily steering that technology work, but we are participating in it. And as we see those technologies advance and look -- and get higher potential, have a higher potential of those things, we would look to try to bring into the portfolio.
So we've got -- what I'd say, we've cast a pretty wide net around the technology space, recognizing that it's requiring some level of evolution, if not breakthroughs and technologies, for them to be successful. And so since you can't really plan for that, we kind of keep a finger on the pulse of a lot of different technologies with the intent then to, as they look more promising, kind of to bring them into the emerging and then commercial technology space. And so that's the work that this new group will be focused on.
And again, it's -- we'll complement what we're doing in the carbon capture and storage. We've got the biofuels work that we've been doing, and we've got the process technology work that we've been doing. And a lot of those things overlap with one another.
Certainly -- and of course, that then also has hydrogen and the process technology work we're doing and the CCS work together have a lot of overlap with potential for hydrogen generation. So I'd say that's the space that we tend to be working on from a technology standpoint.
And then with respect to the spend, this is a long-term focus area for our facilities and businesses. And you can see from the progress we've made with reducing greenhouse gases, it's not something new. It's something we've been after year after year after year. And those opportunities continue to present themselves.
And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that with the new organization and the new processes that we've put in place, we've got more direct and better line of sight to those opportunities so that we can make sure they're getting funded and moving forward. And that's all built into our plans and it's built into our 2025 objectives that we've laid out."

As we think about just the capital spending range over the next several years, the $20 billion to $25 billion and contextualize that with the analysis that you had in the slides on the amount of cash flow contribution in 2025 from some of the new projects coming online, I was wondering if you could just help us pinpoint, what level of spend that you think is required in order to just hold cash flow across the business flat over a multiyear period, understanding it's kind of higher than the 2021 spend, somewhere within that $20 billion to $25 billion?

And we don't have an objective of trying to hold volumes or any other metric. It comes back to if -- what are the projects that we have available to us, the investments, what are the returns that we think we can generate from those investments, what advantage do they have versus industry and within our own portfolio, how robust are they to the price environment.
So I would say that, as we look to build up our investment profile, it's understanding what the value of those investments are and then putting those in the context of the constraints that we're operating under to see which ones get funded and how we prioritize them.
So I would say, in 2020, one of the things, given the impacts of coronavirus and draw on our balance sheet, is we really prioritized and focused on the highest value first. We've still got a really deep portfolio that we'll continue to advance as the circumstances allow and as the market allows, and that's how we're going to kind of go forward. And that range that we've given in the outer years is indicative of what we think it would be required to continue to fund that very attractive set of investments.
Again, I'll come back to, though, if the market and the price environment is not supportive of that, that will be a constraint that continues to moderate that capital. And as I've shown -- I showed on the chart, we've got lots of flexibility, particularly as you move out into the outer years to pull back if we feel like that's the best thing to do given the environment that we find ourselves in, make sure we continue to pay a very strong dividend and maintain a balance sheet that's going to allow us to ride through the cycles and continue to invest. Those are the 3 things.
And I would just say there's no hard formula. It's responding to the current circumstances and making sure that we're striking the right balance because each of those plays a really important part in the value proposition for the corporation."

After I cover the quarterly finance operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives on the quarterly results and how we are positioned for 2021. Following those remarks, Darren and I will be happy to address any questions. 
Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and to the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. 
I'll now highlight developments since the fourth quarter of 2020 on the next slide. 
Across all 3 businesses, improved results reflect encouraging signs of the recovery from the pandemic as vaccinations are administered and some restrictions are lifted. In the Upstream, liquids and gas realizations improved significantly versus the fourth quarter. 
Production was higher driven by lower government-mandated curtailments and higher seasonal gas demand in Europe. And as part of our ongoing efforts to high grade our portfolio, we announced the sale of most of our nonoperated assets in the United Kingdom, Central and Northern North Sea. The sale price of more than $1 billion is subject to closing adjustments and has potential upside of approximately $300 million in contingent payments based on commodity prices. 
In the Downstream, we continue to realize improvements in the North America refining margins. However, in Europe, margins remained impacted by COVID lockdowns. While we have seen improved demand for gasoline and diesel, jet demand remains impacted by global travel restrictions. 
During the winter storm, our Texas refineries were able to provide power to more than 200,000 homes through our cogeneration facilities. 
During the quarter, we announced the intent to convert both the Altona, Australia refinery and the Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals as overall industry rationalization continues. In the quarter, there were approximately 500,000 barrels of industry rationalizations announced. 
In Chemical, tight industry supply shipping constraints and strong demand resulted in global average margins improving to the top of the historic 10-year range. We were able to capture the benefits of these improved margins with strong reliability and the rapid recovery of our operations from the winter storm. In addition, we have continued to deliver further cost efficiencies. 
Across the corporation, improved prices and margins, in addition to cost reduction initiatives, resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of more than $4 billion in the quarter. In February, operations across all 3 businesses were impacted by Winter Storm Uri. Repairs were completed and operations fully recovered by the end of the quarter. 
Finally, we established a Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize and deploy our portfolio of emission reduction technologies. The new business will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net 0 emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris agreement. 
Let's go to Slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative to the prior quarter. First quarter earnings were $2.7 billion, including $31 million of identified items related to severance. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $2.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 million versus the fourth quarter. Despite the impacts of the winter storm, which you will see called out in the table, earnings improved across all businesses, primarily due to higher prices and margins. 
There was a $300 million benefit in the quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives, for which the physical trading strategy had not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings impact of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Also, we have continued to benefit from structurally lower operating costs in all of our business lines. 
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items. 
Upstream earnings improved by over $1.8 billion in the first quarter, with liquid realizations increasing by 42% and gas realizations by 33%. The earnings change associated with volumes was negatively impacted by mix and timing effects, which offset higher production versus the prior quarter. Lower expenses, including structural efficiencies, contributed approximately $170 million in earnings. 
On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of upstream volumes. Upstream volumes increased by an average of approximately 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Gas volumes were 12% higher, mainly due to seasonal gas demand and lower scheduled maintenance. 
Liquids were down 3% with winter storm impacts and higher maintenance. Lower entitlements due to higher prices negatively impacted volumes by approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. 
Reduced government-mandated curtailments increased volumes by about 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, and gas demand was higher by approximately 70,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, mainly due to seasonal gas demand in Europe. 
Guyana and Permian production were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2020. However, compared to the first quarter, Permian production was approximately 20% higher, excluding the impact of the winter storm, an average of around 395,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the quarter. Guyana production increased by approximately 70% or 19,000 barrels per day over the same period. 
Moving to Slide 7. Downstream earnings improved by over $300 million in the first quarter despite the impacts of the winter storm. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $500 million as North America product demand continue to rebound. There was almost $400 million of earnings benefit from the expense reductions in the quarter, including structural efficiencies related to maintenance optimization, logistics and marketing. We also had unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of prior period inventory impacts during the quarter. A reserve for announced terminal conversion is included in the other factor. 
Moving to Chemical on Slide 8. Chemical had a strong quarter, delivering over $1.4 billion in earnings. More than a $700 million improvement versus the fourth quarter. Margins improved by $500 million, driven by tightly supplied, polyethylene and polypropylene markets, impacted by the winter storm, where at its peak, approximately 75% of U.S. polyethylene capacity was off-line. Performance product demand into packaging and durable goods was resilient through the period. 
During the quarter, we had strong reliability, which positioned us to capture the improved margins. We continue to deliver cost reductions through turnaround and maintenance scope optimizations, contributing an additional $150 million to earnings in the quarter. 
On the next slide, I will summarize results versus the first quarter of 2020. Versus the first quarter of 2020, earnings increased by around $500 million. There was a total price margin improvement of about $1.3 billion, driven by higher upstream prices and chemical margins as the market recovered. This is partially offset by lower Downstream margins but excludes the mark-to-market impact of unsettled derivatives, which was driven by the absence of a benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Cost reduction efforts, including structural efficiencies and maintenance, supply chain optimizations and the announced workforce reductions contributed over $1 billion of improvement to earnings. 
Moving to Slide 10, I'll provide further details on our cost savings and CapEx reductions. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $9.2 billion in the first quarter. lower than the same quarter last year. This reflects the significant structural improvements achieved in 2020 from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. 
Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, on track towards the lower end of our full year guidance. This reduction of over $4 billion versus the first quarter of 2020 and was enabled by the flexibility of our short-cycle unconventional assets and by our ability to pace Downstream and Chemical projects consistent with market conditions. As Darren will cover later, we are able to do this while preserving the long-term value of the opportunities. 
Moving on to a summary of cash flow on Slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this was up $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting our ability to capture higher prices and margins and the results of our cost reduction efforts. 
We reduced debt by more than $4 billion, consistent with our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash. 
Turning to Slide 12. I will cover a few key considerations for the second quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to be in line with the first quarter. We expect lower volumes with seasonal gas demand and higher maintenance. The sale of the U.K. Central and Northern North Sea assets is expected to close near midyear, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. 
In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement in line with third-party forecasts with check continuing to recover at a slower pace than gasoline and diesel. Higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds are planned for the quarter. 
In Chemical, we anticipate a tight supply and demand balance with ongoing industry maintenance impacting global supply, and we have higher planned turnarounds in the quarter. 
Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be about $600 million, and we expect to further reduce debt if price and margins remain at current levels. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Darren."
406338,711216480,2264956,"Exxon Mobil Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Exxon Mobil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be back with you. This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action w",2693,"Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be back with you. 
This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action was clear. We made some tough decisions and committed to bold actions. In our fourth quarter call, I reviewed our results, the success we had in meeting, and in some cases, beating those bold commitments. We made a lot of progress over the course of a challenging year. The positive results we announced today reflect not only last year's work, the work we started years ago, work that has positioned us to take advantage of market improvements. 
Today, I joined the call to put that work in context. I'll discuss the foundation for success that we've laid and how it will manifest in growing shareholder value, value that will further materialize as markets continue to recover and as the world transitions to a lower carbon future. 
Our successful response to the unprecedented challenges of 2020 has its roots in 2 critical initiatives started years earlier. The first was our focus on developing an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investments to recapitalize our businesses and increase capacity to generate earnings and cash. Prioritized investments in these opportunities last year are paying dividends this year and will continue to well into the future. 
The second initiative, which began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, was a significant restructuring of our businesses, reducing functional silos, organizing along value chains and consolidating competencies. This greatly reduced organizational complexity, interfaces and overhead. We provided a clearer line of sight to the market, increased ownership for earnings at all levels and improved the speed and quality of decision-making across the corporation. Importantly, it helped our people better relate their work to our bottom line results. 
We see the benefits of this in the first quarter results. Through structural changes, we've permanently reduced operating expenses, capturing $3 billion in 2020 versus 2019, with further efficiencies in the first quarter and more expected through the year. In total, we expect to achieve $6 billion of annual savings by 2023 versus 2019. 
At the same time, we reduced emissions, operated safely and delivered best-ever reliability performance. Our focus in this area also paid off in the first quarter with a well-managed response to the Texas ice storms, minimizing impacts and speeding recovery. Throughout 2020, we work to strike a difficult balance, dramatically reducing near-term spend without compromising longer-term value. We used our balance sheet to maintain spending that was critical to shareholder value, including sustaining a strong dividend. 
We also maintained our work in advancing low-carbon technologies and developing projects with the potential to significantly reduce society's emissions. This work is crucial in underpinning our long-term future and in continuing to grow shareholder value. 
It also facilitated the launch of our Low Carbon Solutions business in the first quarter, a strategic business that we expect to grow with significant investments as we advance low-carbon technologies. We prioritize maintenance activities, ensuring essential work was completed last year and the remainder early this year, ahead of the anticipated demand recovery. 
We reduced 2020 CapEx by 30% versus our original plan. We did this by pacing project execution and leveraging our global projects organization to prioritize and optimally slow projects. We are continuing to pace projects to rebuild the balance sheet and pay down debt. In the first quarter, we made significant progress. Investments are in line with our outlook for the year of $16 billion to $19 billion, and debt was reduced by over $4 billion. 
Throughout this time, we've never lost sight of the long-term fundamentals of our business. We knew economies will recover, populations and living standards would continue to grow, ultimately driving demand for our products and an industry recovery. Today, we are beginning to see this and are well positioned. Thanks to our efforts over the last few years, we are a stronger company with an improving outlook. 
You will, of course, recognize this chart, which we've used since our third quarter call last year. At that time, we made the point that the pandemic had driven industry prices and margins to unsustainably low levels. And while hard to predict when that margins and prices would rebound. And today, we're seeing this rebound, which is happening faster than we thought and for some sectors, rising to higher levels than anticipated. 
The Upstream is back within the 10-year range with Brent prices improving by roughly 40% since the fourth quarter and natural gas up by about 1/3. In the Downstream, margins remain well below the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins, on the other hand, has swung from the bottom to the top. 
One thing is for sure, these margins and prices will continue to move. We've based our plans on a conservative outlook and are positioning our businesses to be successful at or below the bottom of these ranges. At the same time, we're making sure that when the upswings come, we take advantage, which is why we went to great efforts to preserve our portfolio of investments while building in flexibility. It's also why we test each investment against a wide range of market scenarios and insist on structural advantages to generate leading returns at any price. 
Today's portfolio of opportunities is the best we've seen in 20 years. 90% of our Upstream investments and resource additions over the next 5 years, including Guyana, Brazil and the Permian, generate 10% returns at $35 a barrel or less. 
In Guyana, we're continuing to progress Liza Phase 2. Payara is on schedule, and we've begun planning for the next development, Yellowtail. The backlog development offshore Brazil is advancing toward a final investment decision, and we're delivering greater efficiencies in the Permian, efficiencies that are driving down costs for drilling and completions while improving recovery rates and growing production. Based on these improvements and without additional capital, we've increased our 2021 outlook to between 410,000 and 430,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day. 
The Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is ahead of schedule with a projected start-up in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the project for about 25% less than the average cost of a Gulf Coast steam cracker. This facility is a key development in our plan to grow sales of high-value performance products by 60% through 2027. 
As we focused our activities on the highest value investments, we also worked hard to preserve the value of the projects we were pacing. As I mentioned, our global projects organization played a critical role in this, working closely with contractors, partners and resource owners to find efficiencies and reduce spend. Every project was reevaluated and tested against conditions informed by the pandemic. While all remained attractive and in our portfolio, the highest-value opportunities were given priority. Pace projects were evaluated for optimum breakpoints, with work continuing until these were reached. You can see this in the photos, which show the project status at the time the pandemic hit and when they were paused. 
Working closely with contractors, our team successfully offset deferral costs with efficiencies and market savings and preserved portfolio returns of greater than 30%. The CapEx outlook we provided incorporates resumptions of these project activities over time as the market recovers and we make progress deleveraging. 
Striking the right balance in our capital allocation priority was critical. as demonstrated by the price and margin chart. This was particularly true in the depleting businesses of the Upstream. The value of the choices made here are shown in the next couple of slides. 
We are excited by the results of the significant work and strategic investments made since 2017 to reshape our portfolio into one of the most price competitive in the industry, generating strong returns in a variety of price environments. 
Chart on the left, similar to the one used on Investor Day, shows the Brent price needed for upstream resource investments made in 2020 to generate a 10% return. As you can see, more than 90% of the investments require Brent price at or below $35 a barrel. On the right are the anticipated cash flows resulting from the projects retained in our 2020 investment program for this year and in 2025. As you can see, the investments we made in 2020 are making a significant contribution now and into the future. This is particularly true in the Permian, shown on the next slide. 
Last year, we reduced Permian CapEx by about 35%, but maintained a level of investment to support our technology efforts and drive improvements. This work contributed to an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2020 versus 2019 and an increase of 60,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year. 
This work also drove significant progress across a number of variables, as shown on the left. Higher well productivity and lower costs resulted in positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year. which will continue through 2021. 
In addition, with the Poker Lake processing facilities online and pipelines commissioned, we can ensure production is delivered to the highest value outlet at the lowest cost. 
Hopefully, these last 2 charts help illustrate the importance of striking the right capital allocation balance to preserve longer-term value, particularly in trying times. Our first quarter results helped demonstrate this. We maintained our strong dividend, generated strong cash flow, delivered further cost reductions, remain flexible and disciplined in our capital spend, delivered excellent safety, environmental and reliability performance and advanced solutions for a lower carbon economy. 
As we progress through this year, we'll maintain our capital priorities and a balanced approach. Our planned capital range for 2021 remains $16 billion to $19 billion with the outyears at $20 billion to $25 billion. If markets take an unexpected downturn, we have the flexibility to adjust. If margins and prices stay higher than planned, we'll deleverage faster, rebuilding the balance sheet. 
If the price and margin chart I reviewed earlier demonstrated, things can change quickly. A strong balance sheet remains a critical advantage in a capital-intensive commodity business. It also provides an important foundation for managing an uncertain future and the transition of the energy sector, which I'll turn to next. 
I'll start by restating our strategy and addressing the risks of climate change and the energy transition, a strategy based on 4 pillars we've had in place for many years. It begins with mitigating emissions in our operations, which has been a focus for decades. 
Versus 2016, 2020 GHG emissions are down 11%. We met the methane and flaring reductions we committed to in 2018 and established aggressive emission reduction plans through 2025, putting us on a trajectory consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
We are committed to providing products to help customers reduce their emissions. Across the globe, we're helping economies decarbonize by providing natural gas for power generation, reducing emissions by more than half versus coal. 
Our chemical products reduced vehicle weight lowering transportation emissions and preserve shelf life of food, reducing waste and agricultural emissions. Our fuels and lube products, improve efficiency, also helping to reduce emissions. 
We're also proactively engaging on climate policy. We've demonstrated this through our support for the Paris agreement and economy-wide price on carbon, consistent regulations to reduce methane emissions and frameworks to support investment in carbon abatement. 
And finally, we're focusing on developing and deploying scalable technology solutions that are needed to reduce emissions on a larger scale. We're focusing on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors of power generation, heavy-duty transport and industrial manufacturing. 
We've launched our Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize technologies and accelerate large-scale emission reductions in these areas. Since 2000, we've invested more than $10 billion in lower emissions technologies and have plans to invest an additional $3 billion by 2025. Our initial emphasis is on carbon capture and storage, or CCS, a technology critical to achieving the goals of the Paris agreement. 
I expect the magnitude of investments to grow as we work with industry, governments and communities to advance attractive project concepts that also generate shareholder value. Having said this, it's important to keep the current level of planned investments in perspective. When you compare the investment levels of our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses with the size of their markets, our spend represents less than 0.3% of the total addressable market. 
We do the same for our planned investments in CCS, they represent over 3% of the total addressable market, more than 10x the level of investments in our traditional businesses. We think this is reasonable given the early stage of this market's development. With our industry-leading position and decades of experience in CCS, we're well positioned to successfully compete in this growing and potentially large future market. 
As we tried to illustrate in this chart, today, we're the global leader in capturing CO2. In fact, we've captured more anthropogenic CO2 than anyone in the world. We have an interest in over 1/5 of the world's CCS capacity and significant holdings in CO2 pipelines. Grass roots, large-scale CCS projects leverage our competitive advantages in technology and project management as well as decades of experience bringing new ventures to market. This is important particularly for this potentially fast-growing large market, and it's why we launched the Low Carbon Solutions business, which is evaluating and advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities around the world. 
Last week, we introduced the concept of a multi-industry CCS hub to capture and store CO2 emissions from the heavy industry around the Houston Ship Channel. We think a carbon capture innovation zone, similar to an enterprise zone where incentives and policies are designed to encourage economic growth, is a smart way to advance this idea. We help bring together government incentives and private sector investment along with new policies and regulations that would encourage innovation. 
Houston is an ideal location for a major project. The plants along the heavily industrialized ship channel represents some of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. They're also relatively close together, providing project scale and reducing unit costs. 
Houston's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also provides direct access to suitable storage locations. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the geology beneath the seafloor has the capacity to safely store all the CO2 that the entire country currently produces for the next 100 years. As currently envisioned, the project could capture 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. This would put Houston well on its way to reaching its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. 
This concept will need support from many different parties, both private and public. Regulatory and legal support at all levels of government will be crucial for establishing incentives and attracting investment. The federal government already provides some carbon reduction incentives such as tax credits for electric vehicle wind, solar and CCS. Enhancing these credits or establishing a market price on carbon emissions, combined with appropriate rules and oversight, would accelerate solutions. 
We've long talked about the importance of innovation. This multiuser hub concept is just one example of how we're looking to take on large, complex challenges and find solutions to help meet society's demand for lower carbon future. This can play an important role in positioning the company to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
The first quarter results clearly show that we're on the right path and well positioned for a continued market recovery. We will remain flexible while focusing on disciplined investing in high-return, competitively advantaged projects. This will provide the foundation for strong cash flows, a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet. We will remain relentless in structurally reducing costs by fully leveraging our new organization. We will continue to deliver industry-leading safety and reliability performance, meet our emission reduction plans, and help society transition to a lower carbon future, and we will do all this to grow shareholder value. I look forward to taking your questions."

Good to see some of the cost reductions and growth investments really paying dividends here in 2021. 
My first question is actually building on some of the last points you're making, Darren, on carbon reduction efforts in the Houston hub specifically, I think it's a very interesting concept, has a lot of potential. I was wondering if you could elaborate from a policy standpoint, what types of things are needed or policies need to be put in place in order to bring these types of projects to fruition? And then are there other parts within your portfolio globally where there are already policies in place to make these types of investments viable today?"

So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we're looking at doing in this space and reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn't have clear market drivers. And the governments have demonstrated, in other industries when they're looking to reduce CO2, they provide stimulus to catalyze advancements of new technology. I think the big difference with what we're talking about here versus some of the other initiatives that the government has supported is there's not an existing business or market that provides some level of financial incentives. And so I think the work that has to be done with the government is aligning on the incentives to drive investments across industries to drop and lower the CO2 price. And we think we can do that and do it at a very attractive rate of return at much lower prices than what the government is currently spending to reduce CO2. 
And if you recall from our Investor Day, we had a chart that showed the costs associated with reducing CO2 through carbon capture and compare that to the cost of CO2 removal through other mechanisms. And we have the opportunity to reduce significant levels of CO2 at a much lower cost than current policy. So that will be an important part, policy to drive incentives. 
You'll need policies and frameworks to support the legal regime for storing CO2. We'll need permitting to put the facilities in place and run the pipelines. You'll need some frameworks to support the storage and access to the storage offshore. So there's a number of areas that will need to be addressed. And then obviously, we'll have to work with the industries involved here and work with them collaboratively to bring the CO2 in and then also, of course, the communities that we'll be operating in. We'll have to work with them, and we think that's all possible. 
If you think about the work we do around the world and establishing new ventures, bringing new ventures to market, this is very consistent with our experience base. And I'll just point to Guyana, where essentially where we have started from grass roots, a brand-new oil and gas industry, working very closely with the government and community there in Guyana. 
So we've got experience in this space. We've got experience working in collaboration with other industry partners and experience working with governments to bring these complicated things together at scale and make a significant contribution."

So annualized, a $4 billion reduction so far. 
And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect the reductions to increase and move through this year, and I know you have a longer-term target of $3 billion of incremental cost reduction. My question specifically though is, how should we think about the cadence of these cost reductions flowing through for the balance of this year and over the next few years. And as you've embarked on these restructuring initiatives, have you found opportunities that might allow you to exceed this target over time, the $6 billion total target?"

I guess let me just maybe start with where you ended and with respect to the $6 billion. And I just want to make the point, it's not a target. It's not something that we've laid out and asked the organization to figure out how to achieve it. It's actually part of the plans that we've built. And so the organization has a clear line of sight to the reductions, and there's -- they've built that into their plans. We're stewarding the businesses every month versus those plans. And so we feel very good about what we've identified and the work that we have going on. And the first quarter demonstrates that we are continuing to achieve the reductions. 
I would not take the first quarter results and try to multiply those and move them out. I think you're going to see things move with activities as you go through the year. But my expectation is the theme that you're seeing with these reductions will continue, and we will -- we're on track to deliver the $6 billion by the end of 2023. 
I guess the final point I would make here, Devin, is my expectation, as we've been working our way through this and translating those plans into action is we'll find more opportunities. I would expect it will beat the target of the plans that we put out there. We've got work going on now that kind of goes across the corporation. 
I mentioned the fact that we have structurally change the way we run our businesses. That change has now aligned each of the sectors in terms of how we're organized and a lot of the processes that were used to execute the business. That gives us an opportunity to take advantage of this consistency and processes and execution and find additional efficiencies and synergies, and that works underway, which we'll continue to develop as we move through this year, and I suspect we'll have more to talk about it as we finalize our plans for the year at the back end and into the next year's Investor Day. 
So I'm real optimistic that the groundwork that we've laid since 2017 and looking at the businesses and how we reorganize are paying dividends today and are going to continue to pay dividends well into the future."

And thanks for the question, Roger. I would say first quarter performance in Chemicals, first and foremost, reflects that organization's focus on running their operations reliably and safely, a lot of hard work to make sure that the integrity of the operations and the reliability of those operations are maintained. 
And we did a lot of work over last year. And I think moving into the first quarter, that focus has really helped our manufacturing facilities deal with the freeze and recover very rapidly from that. So real proud of that effort. It wasn't easy, but that organization really delivered. 
I think the other thing it demonstrates is the focus that they've had for several years on growing their high-performance products. And we knew that the demand for chemicals has been consistently strong and has been growing in excess of GDP growth around the world. And that fundamental, we think, will continue for some time since chemical plays such an important role in people's modern life and the convenience of the modern life and actually the critical importance of some of the products that Chemicals make. 
Of course, the -- so the big challenge there, though, is as supply comes on in fairly large chunks. With different plants, that tends to result in supply and demand imbalances and lower margins. And of course, we saw that last year. And frankly, going into this year, we kind of anticipated a lot of capacity coming on, which would squeeze the margins and make for a challenging year. 
I think what we've seen is with the impact of last year and the pullback in spending that was required due to the pandemic and then probably exacerbated by the Texas storm here with all the capacity in the Gulf Coast area, the supply has gotten pretty tight as demand has continued to move. And then with the economic recovery and the rebound that we're seeing, that's put some more demand into the system. So it's -- I think the first quarter reflects good operations, good performance, good focus on growing our high-performance products and some really helpful market conditions from a supply and demand standpoint. 
My expectation as we move forward is we'll see some of that supply come back on a recovery from the ice storms and some of this new capacity that was deferred will start to make its way back into the market, and that will help probably ease some of the tightness. But our expectation is we'll continue to see a pretty good market here this year for the Chemical business."

Well, as we've said, with our capital allocation priorities, there's 3 legs to the stool, so to speak. And, obviously, really important for the foundation of success for the future is investing in the right projects, particularly in the Upstream with the depletion nature of that business. We've got to find industry advantaged investment opportunities. In the Chemical business, making sure that we're investing in the high-performance products that meet the demand, the growing demand that we're seeing around the world. And in the Downstream, investing in strategic sites to high-grade their production and make sure that the production is in line with the demand in the marketplace. 
And so that's critical element, and that's something that we stay focused on as we went through 2020, making sure that we didn't compromise the value of that particular capital allocation priority. The dividend, obviously, a critical part of that, and sustaining that dividend was a commitment that we've had for a long, long time, and we stay committed to that. So that's obviously going to be an important factor going forward. And then the balance sheet is making sure that we maintain the capacity to ride through the commodity cycles and not compromise those first 2 priorities that I talked to you about. And that's what we did in 2020. 
Obviously, the pandemic was a very unusual year, much deeper than any typical commodity cycle. So we had to lean harder on that than we normally would. We're very committed now to making sure that we rebuild that in anticipation of future commodity cycles. 
I think what we said during the Investor Day was we're going to shoot for something between 20% and 25% debt to capital. And that still feels like a reasonable place to be, and we'll work our way towards that as we go through this year and probably into next -- obviously, depending upon the price and margin environment that we find ourselves in."

I would say we haven't tried to update that number. I think what we tried to do with the Investor Day is just give you and others the confidence that with our portfolio and the plans that we had, we were robust to a very wide range of prices. The fact that the chemical margins are as good as they are today, says that, that breakeven has come down. But frankly, we're not really sharpening our pencils anymore on that because we've got a plan, and the foundations of that plant haven't changed. I just think we feel better about the position that we're in today, given where the market is at. We'll take advantage of it while it's here.

I think I've been talking about that now for several years. And what that organization is demonstrating is, indeed, they are making improvements and making them at a faster rate than we had planned. And so that update with the production is a function of that performance improvement. We have not increased the capital allocation to that business. They're basically running at their planned spend. And obviously, that is -- that plan is across the full year, and that number will be -- will change over the year based on their plan."

You have the $20 billion to $25 billion target out there for the long term, which would obviously be still a pretty big step up from, say, $16 billion to $17 billion. 
So just more intermediate term as we think out to, say, 2022, should we think of the spending being more gradual in terms of the ramp back up, in terms of getting to the 20, 25 long term? Just any color there would be helpful."

We've got plans through 2025 with specific numbers. We're not managing the business to ranges. We have plans. And those ranges frankly reflect the recognition that -- this is -- we got a big business, a lot of variables impacting our projects. Things are going to move, and we can't precisely call exactly when things will occur, but we've got a pretty good basis for that, and that's the plan. And that range that we're showing reflects what I would say is how all these pieces tend to kind of come together and manifest themselves in any one quarter or a year. And so that range gives us, I think, right kind of flexibility to make sure that what we're talking to you about, some of that inherent variability in the plant. 
So we're not kind of wondering which end of that range we'll be at. We've got plans within that range and what I said continues to be the case that we're focused on delivering on those plans. I think the way to think about the spending is recognize we put these plans together, and reviewed them initially with the Board in October and finalize them in November and then very quickly came out with the release that talked about that. 
If you think about the October time frame and where prices we're at, reflect on the chart that I showed you, there was uncertainty as to exactly how the future would manifest itself. We knew that recovery would come just based on some of those underlying fundamentals, but really difficult to call. 
So our plans basically were more back-end loaded. And so what you're seeing in the first quarter is a reflection of the recognition that while things will recover, that we may still have some very challenging times here in the first quarter and into the second quarter, so making sure that we were building plans that comprehended that and anticipated that and would be robust to that. And so that's kind of how we built and why the numbers that you see in the first quarter are lower than maybe what would be a ratable run rate is because we had anticipated a probably more challenging environment than certainly that we're seeing today. So that will ramp up. 
I think the other point I'd make, Phil, is just the point I made about our pace projects and the good work that our project organization did and thinking through, given a portfolio of very attractive, high-return projects. And as I said, we tested all those informed by what we are seeing with the pandemic, tested whether or not they were going to generate the returns and bring the value that we had expected, and all of them continue to look attractive. And so we wanted to make sure that in the short term, we can serve spend to respond to the challenges of the pandemic, but make sure that we didn't compromise that longer-term value. And that was the real challenge of last year and the plans that we laid out reflect that. And so as you move forward, in the back half of this year and into next year, what you're seeing is some of those projects resuming activities on those product -- projects and seeing that spend go up. And so that's, I think, how I would suggest you think about that, is feathering in those projects in a very managed way that our project organization is working very closely with our partners and contractors to make sure that we bring those things back online and get that work going in a very efficient and effective manner."

I think that project has opportunities to do both. If you -- again, what we've been talking about for some time, and I think if I go back a year ago, the litmus test with respect to whether or not the company was focused on managing the risk of climate change and position for an energy transition was whether or not you're investing in solar and wind. 
Frankly, I've been very encouraged at how quickly that conversation has evolved and the recognition that there remains a significant challenge above and beyond the rule that wind and solar and electric vehicles, which they will play an important role. But above and beyond that, how do you decarbonize some of these very difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and do it in a way that is efficient and the lowest cost to society. And so that's the work that, certainly, we've been talking about for some time and the work that we've been investing in with respect to technologies to bring down the cost of the technologies that we believe will be required to achieve that. That's the venture that we launched in 2018, our carbon capture venture to start looking at how we could commercialize some of that technology and start looking for opportunities around the world. So all that was happening with this view of what I would say is a business opportunity to meet an evolving demand of society, which is a reduction in CO2. 
And the way we're thinking about that, that's a new business. That's a new demand for that society, I think, is a strong desire for. And so we're at the early stages of a new business. And what we've put out there is the opportunity to leverage the skills that we have, the competencies that we've developed over decades the experience that we have in bringing new ventures to market, working with governments and leveraging our own capabilities. And this Houston Ship Channel represents exactly that. 
And we'd be working with a number of companies and industries there, so collaborating with others, working with the government. And we -- our own facilities would be involved in that. So I think it's kind of a mix of all those things that you brought up, Phil. It's an opportunity to reduce our own emissions, an opportunity for others to contribute at scale and a cost-effective way to reduce their emissions. And then again, potentially, there is an emerging market for CO2 reduction credits, maybe a way to meet that market demand as well. 
And so I think it's early to take a real sharp pencil and lay all that out, but we think the fundamentals are there. And it just becomes -- comes down to then working with the relevant parties to shape the policies and the frameworks and the constructs of that project to take advantage of that -- of those emerging fundamentals."

Neil talked about the work we had been doing in assessing the portfolio and upgrading that portfolio. And obviously, 2 -- a couple of levers to that. One, one lever is clearly the additional investments in bringing in more profitable lower cost production opportunities and then working on some of the tail items of our portfolio to see if others put a higher value on them, particularly given how rich the new opportunities were for us. 
And so that portfolio of opportunities remains. We've been out actively marketing a number of those. And as you can imagine, last year really slowed that pace down just because of the number of buyers and I'd say the range of uncertainty with where the future was going. 
The way I'd characterize it today is we're continuing that activity on those assets. And I'd say the work that we did in 2020 puts us in a really good position this year. We did not compromise the value that we expected to achieve and that slowed things down. But I think as we go into this year, there's different view that's being taken on the future and the horizon and the price environment, which is generating more interest. And so the way I'd characterize it right now, same set of assets, a lot more interest and discussions happening. And we'll see if we can find the right buyer and settle on a value that's kind of a win-win proposition and that work goes on. And I'm optimistic that we'll see that accelerate a bit, but It will be accelerated based on a lot of work that's already happened and will continue to happen."

My follow-up is really more of a kind of philosophical question, Darren. I guess a year ago, your yield was getting up there.

You've got a fantastic organic portfolio, and some of your peers are now kind of starting with an investment case, you could argue, meaning growth is off the table for investors for the -- at least on EVs.

But I would also tell you that at the end of the day, we're very focused on maximizing our growth in shareholder value and so keeping a kind of a firm eye on the opportunity set. And if things develop, if market conditions drive an opportunity that would be accretive and consistent with the existing portfolio and the capital allocation priorities that we've talked about, then that would certainly be an opportunity that we'd look at. I don't think we take anything off the table when it comes to thinking about the future and how we might leverage our capacities. And then if we find somebody where we can find some synergies with their capabilities and ours and to take advantage of that and together grow value at a rate faster than we can organically. 
But I'll come back to and finish on the point that I started with is we -- the portfolio we've got is pretty attractive.

So I've doubled from your once a year. 
With respect, I think, to the Board and how we think about that, first comment I would make is since I've been in this job, been engaging with shareholders pretty consistently and listening to their perspectives and taking their feedback on. And I think as a result of that, you've seen quite a bit of change in terms of how we interface with the shareholders and in fact, with you and your community. So I think we are responding to the feedback that we get. 
I would tell you that every decision that the Board has made with new directors, and we've brought on 6 since I came into the chair in 2017 have all been in response to and related to the feedback that we've been getting to our shareholders. In terms of the types of competencies and skill sets that they think would benefit our company and managing for the future and Frankly, that continues to be an ongoing dialogue, and we continue to look for what are the capabilities and skills required to successfully manage a business like ours. 
If you look at the Board we have today, and how we -- the Board Affairs Committee goes through the processes, I think, first, you got to recognize this is a big business that spans the globe and also spans a number of different industrial sectors, consumer product sectors, very complicated, a lot of challenges across the different countries and across the different businesses. And so really look to make sure that the folks that we bring into the Board have the perspective and the experience of managing global businesses, complex businesses, ones that span the globe and ones that have the kind of challenges that we see. 
Obviously, if you look at the industry and our company over time, technology and the evolution of technology and how that applies to our business has been a really important part of of the value creation that we've driven over the years and a really important part in terms of the future and how that evolves. And so technology and understanding of the technology, engineering science is an important part of things that we look for in terms of the skills and capabilities of the investors of our Board members. 
If you think about the capital intensity of the business and how we are so intimately tied into economic growth in economies around the world and people standards of living, directors have had that experience in managing, I think, is important. And you can see that in some of our directors that have that experience in capital-intensive link closely to economic activity. So that's important. 
And then I think the third point I would make is understanding of and experience in transitioning businesses. And from our perspective, it's not necessarily transitioning an energy company. It's transitioning business with fundamental drivers, how you think about the changes in those fundamental drivers and how you effectively respond to those changes while creating shareholder value. And if you look at the folks that we have on the board, a number of our individuals have really pertinent and relevant experience to managing large corporations successfully through transitions, albeit potentially in different industries. 
We also look to bring on industry experience that I would tell you has been a capability and competencies that we've been working to fill for quite some time. It's challenging to find someone who has the relevant experience and can relate to all the businesses that we're in, the scale that we're in and the global coverage. And I think we were very lucky last year to engage with after he retired in the middle of 2020, and very pleased that he came on the Board and bring some of the experience from Asia, which is obviously a really important region for our company and the fact that that's where a lot of the growth is happening. So that was a big advantage. 
And then the final point I'll make with respect to some of the new directors that we brought on is thinking about a transition with all the uncertainties associated with it and the challenge is how to best allocate your capital in that space and make sure that, one, that you're moving the business in the direction consistent with some of those broader trends, but doing it in a way that protects shareholder value and generates returns. And so I think some of the new directors have got some really good -- a really good track record in thinking through and doing that and has been bringing some of that additional perspective to many of our existing directors who also have that capital allocation experience. 
And so I think we've got a really experienced Board with a lot of complementary skills. And the final point I would make, which is really, really important is the chemistry of the Board, the culture that we have, the willingness for those directors to work collectively, collaboratively to engage, discuss, debate, I think, is absolutely critical. And what we find today is our Board meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of exploring, debating and all done in a very constructive way, all done focused on driving -- ultimately driving value. And so it's, I think, a very healthy Board that respects one another, but is very focused at the same time in driving value. And they've been a big part  in helping reshape the company and setting us on the path that we're on now."

I would tell you that is the current estimate and that I would expect it to grow. The recent announcement we made with [indiscernible] confirmed a deeper play. And so I think additional opportunity or suggestive of an additional opportunity and resources that we haven't fully quantified yet. So I think it's a very rich set of opportunities that we're going to continue to progress. 
And I wouldn't look for a big bang per se. I would look for a continued and steady progression of bringing those opportunities to market. I think we've laid out a plan that's pretty consistent with that, working very closely with the government and the people of Guyana to continue to progress that resource. And really bring a lot of economic opportunity to the country and the people of Guyana. And I think we're beginning to see the benefits of that manifest themselves, and we'll continue to contribute on a ratable basis there. So I would just say a good, steady drumbeat of improvement as we move through those development and those projects. I think today, we're talking a potential for 7 to 10 FPSOs, 6 projects online by 2027. So we feel really good about what we're finding in Guyana and a very constructive engagement with the government in terms of those developments. 
With respect to LNG, obviously, gas is going to continue to play a really important role. As economies around the world develop, populations grow, people standards of living grow is all going to require power generation, and gas is going to continue to play an important role, in part because it's a really good substitute for coal and the fact that it's got much lower emissions, obviously, and lower particulate. 
It also has the potential with time to basically be used in making hydrogen, and that could play a role going forward as well. So I think gas is going to continue to be a really important part as societies and economies grow and as we move into lower carbon future. 
And so in that context, the LNG opportunities remain an important part of the portfolio, and we continue to work very closely with the governments around progressing discussions on how we continue to build on the portfolio that we have and expand those opportunities and do it in a way that both benefits the countries and the communities in those countries but at the same time, are attractive to us and compete within our portfolio. And so that work goes on. We're continuing to have very constructive conversations. And I would expect to see those advance at a pace that's consistent with those conversations landing at the right frameworks for progressing those projects."

Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and to the supplemental information at the end of this presentation.  
I'll now highlight developments since the fourth quarter of 2020 on the next slide.  
Across all 3 businesses, improved results reflect encouraging signs of the recovery from the pandemic as vaccinations are administered and some restrictions are lifted. In the Upstream, liquids and gas realizations improved significantly versus the fourth quarter.  
Production was higher driven by lower government-mandated curtailments and higher seasonal gas demand in Europe. And as part of ongoing efforts to high grade our portfolio, we announced the sale of most of our nonoperated assets in the United Kingdom, Central and Northern North Sea. The sale price of more than $1 billion is subject to closing adjustments and has potential upside of approximately $300 million in contingent payments based on commodity prices.  
In the Downstream, we continue to realize improvements in the North America refining margins. However, in Europe, margins remained impacted by COVID lockdowns. While we have seen improved demand for gasoline and diesel, jet demand remains impacted by global travel restrictions.  
During the winter storm, our Texas refineries were able to provide power to more than 200,000 homes through our cogeneration facilities.  
During the quarter, we announced the intent to convert both the Altona, Australia refinery and the Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals as overall industry rationalization continues. In the quarter, there were approximately 500,000 barrels of industry rationalizations announced.  
In Chemical, tight industry supply shipping constraints and strong demand resulted in global average margins improving to the top of the historic 10-year range. We were able to capture the benefits of these improved margins with strong reliability and the rapid recovery of our operations from the winter storm. In addition, we have continued to deliver further cost efficiencies.  
Across the corporation, improved prices and margins, in addition to cost reduction initiatives, resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of more than $4 billion in the quarter. In February, operations across all 3 businesses were impacted by Winter Storm Uri. Repairs were completed and operations fully recovered by the end of the quarter.  
Finally, we established a Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize and deploy our portfolio of emission reduction technologies. The new business will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net 0 emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris agreement.  
Let's go to Slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative to the prior quarter. First quarter earnings were $2.7 billion, including $31 million of identified items related to severance. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $2.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 [ billion ] versus the fourth quarter. Despite the impacts of the winter storm, which you will see caught out in the table, earnings improved across all businesses, primarily due to higher prices and margins.  
There was a $300 million benefit in the quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives, for which the physical trading strategy had not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings impact of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Also, we have continued to benefit from structurally lower operating costs in all of our business lines.  
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items.  
Upstream earnings improved by over $1.8 billion in the first quarter, with liquid realizations increasing by 42% and gas realizations by 33%. The earnings change associated with volumes was negatively impacted by mix and timing effects, which offset higher production versus the prior quarter. Lower expenses, including structural efficiencies, contributed approximately $170 million in earnings.  
On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of upstream volumes. Upstream volumes increased by an average of approximately 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Gas volumes were 12% higher, mainly due to seasonal gas demand and lower scheduled maintenance.  
Liquids were down 3% with winter storm impacts and higher maintenance. Lower entitlements due to higher prices negatively impacted volumes by approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.  
Reduced government-mandated curtailments increased volumes by about 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, and gas demand was higher by approximately 70,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, mainly due to seasonal gas demand in Europe.  
Guyana and Permian production were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2020. However, compared to the first quarter, Permian production was approximately 20% higher, excluding the impact of the winter storm, an average of around 395,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the quarter. Guyana production increased by approximately 70% or 19,000 barrels per day over the same period.  
Moving to Slide 7. Downstream earnings improved by over $300 million in the first quarter despite the impacts of the winter storm. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $500 million as North America product demand continue to rebound. There was almost $400 million of earnings benefit from the expense reductions in the quarter, including structural efficiencies related to maintenance optimization, logistics and marketing. We also had unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of prior period inventory impacts during the quarter. A reserve for announced terminal conversion is included in the other factor.  
Moving to Chemical on Slide 8. Chemical had a strong quarter, delivering over $1.4 billion in earnings. More than a $700 million improvement versus the fourth quarter. Margins improved by $500 million, driven by tightly supplied, polyethylene and polypropylene markets, impacted by the winter storm, where at its peak, approximately 75% of U.S. polyethylene capacity was off-line. Performance product demand into packaging and durable goods was resilient through the period.  
During the quarter, we had strong reliability, which positioned us to capture the improved margins. We continue to deliver cost reductions through turnaround and maintenance scope optimizations, contributing an additional $150 million to earnings in the quarter.  
On the next slide, I will summarize results versus the first quarter of 2020. Versus the first quarter of 2020, earnings increased by around $500 million. There was a total price margin improvement of about $1.3 billion, driven by higher upstream prices and chemical margins as the market recovered. This is partially offset by lower Downstream margins but excludes the mark-to-market impact of unsettled derivatives, which was driven by the absence of a benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Cost reduction efforts, including structural efficiencies and maintenance, supply chain optimizations and the announced workforce reductions contributed over $1 billion of improvement to earnings.  
Moving to Slide 10, I'll provide further details on our cost savings and CapEx reductions. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $9.2 billion in the first quarter, $1 billion lower than the same quarter last year. This reflects the significant structural improvements achieved in 2020 from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.  
Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, on track towards the lower end of our full year guidance. This reduction of over $4 billion versus the first quarter of 2020 was enabled by the flexibility of our short-cycle unconventional assets and by our ability to pace Downstream and Chemical projects consistent with market conditions. As Darren will cover later, we are able to do this while preserving the long-term value of the opportunities.  
Moving on to a summary of cash flow on Slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this was up $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting our ability to capture higher prices and margins and the results of our cost reduction efforts.  
We reduced debt by more than $4 billion, consistent with our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash.  
Turning to Slide 12. I will cover a few key considerations for the second quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to be in line with the first quarter. We expect lower volumes with seasonal gas demand and higher maintenance. The sale of the U.K. Central and Northern North Sea assets is expected to close near midyear, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals.  
In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement in line with third-party forecasts with check continuing to recover at a slower pace than gasoline and diesel. Higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds are planned for the quarter.  
In Chemical, we anticipate a tight supply and demand balance with ongoing industry maintenance impacting global supply, and we have higher planned turnarounds in the quarter.  
Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be about $600 million, and we expect to further reduce debt if price and margins remain at current levels.  
With that, I will now turn the call over to Darren."

It's good to be back with you.  This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action",2693,"Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be back with you.  
This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action was clear. We made some tough decisions and committed to bold actions. In our fourth quarter call, I reviewed our results, the success we had in meeting, and in some cases, beating those bold commitments. We made a lot of progress over the course of a challenging year. The positive results we announced today reflect not only last year's work, the work we started years ago, work that has positioned us to take advantage of market improvements.  
Today, I joined the call to put that work in context. I'll discuss the foundation for success that we've laid and how it will manifest in growing shareholder value, value that will further materialize as markets continue to recover and as the world transitions to a lower carbon future.  
Our successful response to the unprecedented challenges of 2020 has its roots in 2 critical initiatives started years earlier. The first was our focus on developing an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investments to recapitalize our businesses and increase capacity to generate earnings and cash. Prioritized investments in these opportunities last year are paying dividends this year and will continue to well into the future. The second initiative, which began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, was the significant restructuring of our businesses, reducing functional silos, organizing along value chains and consolidating competencies. This greatly reduced organizational complexity, interfaces and overhead. We provided a clearer line of sight to the market, increased ownership for earnings at all levels and improved the speed and quality of decision-making across the corporation. Importantly, it helped our people better relate their work to our bottom line results.  
We see the benefits of this in the first quarter results. Through structural changes, we've permanently reduced operating expenses, capturing $3 billion in 2020 versus 2019, with further efficiencies in the first quarter and more expected through the year. In total, we expect to achieve $6 billion of annual savings by 2023 versus 2019.  
At the same time, we reduced emissions, operated safely and delivered best-ever reliability performance. Our focus in this area also paid off in the first quarter with a well-managed response to the Texas ice storms, minimizing impacts and speeding recovery. Throughout 2020, we work to strike a difficult balance, dramatically reducing near-term spend without compromising longer-term value. We used our balance sheet to maintain spending that was critical to shareholder value, including sustaining a strong dividend.  
We also maintained our work in advancing low-carbon technologies and developing projects with the potential to significantly reduce society's emissions. This work is crucial in underpinning our long-term future and in continuing to grow shareholder value.  
It also facilitated the launch of our Low Carbon Solutions business in the first quarter, a strategic business that we expect to grow with significant investments as we advance low-carbon technologies. We prioritize maintenance activities, ensuring essential work was completed last year and the remainder early this year, ahead of the anticipated demand recovery.  
We reduced 2020 CapEx by 30% versus our original plan. We did this by pacing project execution and leveraging our global projects organization to prioritize and optimally slow projects. We are continuing to pace projects to rebuild the balance sheet and pay down debt. In the first quarter, we made significant progress. Investments are in line with our outlook for the year of $16 billion to $19 billion, and debt was reduced by over $4 billion. Throughout this time, we've never lost sight of the long-term fundamentals of our business. We knew economies will recover, populations and living standards would continue to grow, ultimately driving demand for our products and an industry recovery. Today, we are beginning to see this and are well positioned. Thanks to our efforts over the last few years, we are a stronger company with an improving outlook.  
You will, of course, recognize this chart, which we've used since our third quarter call last year. At that time, we made the point that the pandemic had driven industry prices and margins to unsustainably low levels. And while hard to predict when that margins and prices would rebound. And today, we're seeing this rebound, which is happening faster than we thought and for some sectors, rising to higher levels than anticipated.  
The Upstream is back within the 10-year range with Brent prices improving by roughly 40% since the fourth quarter and natural gas up by about 1/3. In the Downstream, margins remain well below the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins, on the other hand, has swung from the bottom to the top. 
One thing is for sure, these margins and prices will continue to move. We've based our plans on a conservative outlook and are positioning our businesses to be successful at or below the bottom of these ranges. At the same time, we're making sure that when the upswings come, we take advantage, which is why we went to great efforts to preserve our portfolio of investments while building in flexibility. It's also why we test each investment against a wide range of market scenarios and insist on structural advantages to generate leading returns at any price.  
Today's portfolio of opportunities is the best we've seen in 20 years. 90% of our Upstream investments and resource additions over the next 5 years, including Guyana, Brazil and the Permian, generate 10% returns at $35 a barrel or less.  
In Guyana, we're continuing to progress Liza Phase 2. Payara is on schedule, and we've begun planning for the next development, Yellowtail. The backlog development offshore Brazil is advancing toward a final investment decision, and we're delivering greater efficiencies in the Permian, efficiencies that are driving down costs for drilling and completions while improving recovery rates and growing production. Based on these improvements and without additional capital, we've increased our 2021 outlook to between 410,000 and 430,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day.  
The Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is ahead of schedule with a projected start-up in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the project for about 25% less than the average cost of a Gulf Coast steam cracker. This facility is a key development in our plan to grow sales of high-value performance products by 60% through 2027. As we focused our activities on the highest value investments, we also worked hard to preserve the value of the projects we were pacing. As I mentioned, our global projects organization played a critical role in this, working closely with contractors, partners and resource owners to find efficiencies and reduce spend. Every project was reevaluated and tested against conditions informed by the pandemic. While all remained attractive and in our portfolio, the highest-value opportunities were given priority. Pace projects were evaluated for optimum breakpoints, with work continuing until these were reached. You can see this in the photos, which show the project status at the time the pandemic hit and when they were paused.  
Working closely with contractors, our team successfully offset deferral costs with efficiencies and market savings and preserved portfolio returns of greater than 30%. The CapEx outlook we provided incorporates resumptions of these project activities over time as the market recovers and we make progress deleveraging.  
Striking the right balance in our capital allocation priority was critical, as demonstrated by the price and margin chart. This was particularly true in the depleting businesses of the Upstream. The value of the choices made here are shown in the next couple of slides.  
We are excited by the results of the significant work and strategic investments made since 2017 to reshape our portfolio into one of the most price competitive in the industry, generating strong returns in a variety of price environments.  
Chart on the left, similar to the one used on Investor Day, shows the Brent price needed for upstream resource investments made in 2020 to generate a 10% return. As you can see, more than 90% of the investments require Brent price at or below $35 a barrel. On the right are the anticipated cash flows resulting from the projects retained in our 2020 investment program for this year and in 2025. As you can see, the investments we made in 2020 are making a significant contribution now and into the future. This is particularly true in the Permian, shown on the next slide.  
Last year, we reduced Permian CapEx by about 35%, but maintained a level of investment to support our technology efforts and drive improvements. This work contributed to an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2020 versus 2019 and an increase of 60,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year. This work also drove significant progress across a number of variables, as shown on the left. Higher well productivity and lower costs resulted in positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year, which will continue through 2021.  
In addition, with the Poker Lake processing facilities online and pipelines commissioned, we can ensure production is delivered to the highest value outlet at the lowest cost.  
Hopefully, these last 2 charts help illustrate the importance of striking the right capital allocation balance to preserve longer-term value, particularly in trying times. Our first quarter results helped demonstrate this. We maintained our strong dividend, generated strong cash flow, delivered further cost reductions, remain flexible and disciplined in our capital spend, delivered excellent safety, environmental and reliability performance and advanced solutions for a lower carbon economy.  
As we progress through this year, we'll maintain our capital priorities and a balanced approach. Our planned capital range for 2021 remains $16 billion to $19 billion with the outyears at $20 billion to $25 billion. If markets take an unexpected downturn, we have the flexibility to adjust. If margins and prices stay higher than planned, we'll deleverage faster, rebuilding the balance sheet.  
If the price and margin chart I reviewed earlier demonstrated, things can change quickly. A strong balance sheet remains a critical advantage in a capital-intensive commodity business. It also provides an important foundation for managing an uncertain future and the transition of the energy sector, which I'll turn to next.  
I'll start by restating our strategy and addressing the risks of climate change and the energy transition, a strategy based on 4 pillars we've had in place for many years. It begins with mitigating emissions in our operations, which has been a focus for decades.  
Versus 2016, 2020 GHG emissions are down 11%. We met the methane and flaring reductions we committed to in 2018 and established aggressive emission reduction plans through 2025, putting us on a trajectory consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are committed to providing products to help customers reduce their emissions. Across the globe, we're helping economies decarbonize by providing natural gas for power generation, reducing emissions by more than half versus coal.  
Our chemical products reduced vehicle weight lowering transportation emissions and preserve shelf life of food, reducing waste and agricultural emissions. Our fuels and lube products, improve efficiency, also helping to reduce emissions.  
We're also proactively engaging on climate policy. We've demonstrated this through our support for the Paris Agreement and economy-wide price on carbon, consistent regulations to reduce methane emissions and frameworks to support investment in carbon abatement.  
And finally, we're focusing on developing and deploying scalable technology solutions that are needed to reduce emissions on a larger scale. We're focusing on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors of power generation, heavy-duty transport and industrial manufacturing.  
We've launched our Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize technologies and accelerate large-scale emission reductions in these areas. Since 2000, we've invested more than $10 billion in lower emissions technologies and have plans to invest an additional $3 billion by 2025. Our initial emphasis is on carbon capture and storage, or CCS, a technology critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.  
I expect the magnitude of investments to grow as we work with industry, governments and communities to advance attractive project concepts that also generate shareholder value. Having said this, it's important to keep the current level of planned investments in perspective. When you compare the investment levels of our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses with the size of their markets, our spend represents less than 0.3% of the total addressable market.  
We do the same for our planned investments in CCS, they represent over 3% of the total addressable market, more than 10x the level of investments in our traditional businesses. We think this is reasonable given the early stage of this market's development. With our industry-leading position and decades of experience in CCS, we're well positioned to successfully compete in this growing and potentially large future market.  
As we tried to illustrate in this chart, today, we're the global leader in capturing CO2. In fact, we've captured more anthropogenic CO2 than anyone in the world. We have an interest in over 1/5 of the world's CCS capacity and significant holdings in CO2 pipelines. Grass roots, large-scale CCS projects leverage our competitive advantages in technology and project management as well as decades of experience bringing new ventures to market. This is important particularly for this potentially fast-growing large market, and it's why we launched the Low Carbon Solutions business, which is evaluating and advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities around the world.  
Last week, we introduced the concept of a multi-industry CCS hub to capture and store CO2 emissions from the heavy industry around the Houston Ship Channel. We think a carbon capture innovation zone, similar to an enterprise zone where incentives and policies are designed to encourage economic growth, is a smart way to advance this idea. We help bring together government incentives and private sector investment along with new policies and regulations that would encourage innovation.  
Houston is an ideal location for a major project. The plants along the heavily industrialized ship channel represents some of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. They're also relatively close together, providing project scale and reducing unit costs.  
Houston's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also provides direct access to suitable storage locations. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the geology beneath the seafloor has the capacity to safely store all the CO2 that the entire country currently produces for the next 100 years. As currently envisioned, the project could capture 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. This would put Houston well on its way to reaching its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. This concept will need support from many different parties, both private and public. Regulatory and legal support at all levels of government will be crucial for establishing incentives and attracting investment. The federal government already provides some carbon reduction incentives such as tax credits for electric vehicle wind, solar and CCS. Enhancing these credits or establishing a market price on carbon emissions, combined with appropriate rules and oversight, would accelerate solutions.  
We've long talked about the importance of innovation. This multiuser hub concept is just one example of how we're looking to take on large, complex challenges and find solutions to help meet society's demand for lower carbon future. This can play an important role in positioning the company to deliver long-term shareholder value.  
The first quarter results clearly show that we're on the right path and well positioned for a continued market recovery. We will remain flexible while focusing on disciplined investing in high-return, competitively advantaged projects. This will provide the foundation for strong cash flows, a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet. We will remain relentless in structurally reducing costs by fully leveraging our new organization. We will continue to deliver industry-leading safety and reliability performance, meet our emission reduction plans, and help society transition to a lower carbon future, and we will do all this to grow shareholder value. I look forward to taking your questions."

Good to see some of the cost reductions and growth investments really paying dividends here in 2021. 
My first question is actually building on some of the last points you're making, Darren, on carbon reduction efforts in the Houston hub specifically, I think it's a very interesting concept, has a lot of potential. I was wondering if you could elaborate from a policy standpoint, what types of things are needed or policies need to be put in place in order to bring these types of projects to fruition? And then are there other parts within your portfolio globally where there are already policies in place to make these types of investments viable today?"
406338,711216480,2265165,"Exxon Mobil Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Exxon Mobil Corporation","Executives","Sure. Thanks, Devin. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we're looking at doing in this space and reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn't have clear market drivers. And the governments have de",417,"Sure. Thanks, Devin. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we're looking at doing in this space and reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn't have clear market drivers. And the governments have demonstrated, in other industries when they're looking to reduce CO2, they provide stimulus to catalyze advancements of new technology. I think the big difference with what we're talking about here versus some of the other initiatives that the government has supported is there's not an existing business or market that provides some level of financial incentives. And so I think the work that has to be done with the government is aligning on the incentives to drive investments across industries to drop and lower the CO2 price. And we think we can do that and do it at a very attractive rate of return at much lower prices than what the government is currently spending to reduce CO2. 
And if you recall from our Investor Day, we had a chart that showed the costs associated with reducing CO2 through carbon capture and compare that to the cost of CO2 removal through other mechanisms. And we have the opportunity to reduce significant levels of CO2 at a much lower cost than current policy. So that will be an important part, policy to drive incentives. 
You'll need policies and frameworks to support the legal regime for storing CO2. We'll need permitting to put the facilities in place and run the pipelines. You'll need some frameworks to support the storage and access to the storage offshore. So there's a number of areas that will need to be addressed. And then obviously, we'll have to work with the industries involved here and work with them collaboratively to bring the CO2 in and then also, of course, the communities that we'll be operating in. We'll have to work with them, and we think that's all possible. 
If you think about the work we do around the world and establishing new ventures, bringing new ventures to market, this is very consistent with our experience base. And I'll just point to Guyana, where essentially where we have started from grassroots, a brand-new oil and gas industry, working very closely with the government and community there in Guyana. 
So we've got experience in this space. We've got experience working in collaboration with other industry partners and experience working with governments to bring these complicated things together at scale and make a significant contribution."

So annualized, a $4 billion reduction so far. 
And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect the reductions to increase and move through this year, and I know you have a longer-term target of $3 billion of incremental cost reduction. My question specifically though is, how should we think about the cadence of these cost reductions flowing through for the balance of this year and over the next few years. And as you've embarked on these restructuring initiatives, have you found opportunities that might allow you to exceed this target over time, the $6 billion total target?"

I guess let me just maybe start with where you ended and with respect to the $6 billion. And I just want to make the point, it's not a target. It's not something that we've laid out and asked the organization to figure out how to achieve it. It's actually part of the plans that we've built. And so the organization has a clear line of sight to the reductions, and there's -- they've built that into their plans. We're stewarding the businesses every month versus those plans. And so we feel very good about what we've identified and the work that we have going on. And the first quarter demonstrates that we are continuing to achieve the reductions. 
I would not take the first quarter results and try to multiply those and move them out. I think you're going to see things move with activities as you go through the year. But my expectation is the theme that you're seeing with these reductions will continue, and we will -- we're on track to deliver the $6 billion by the end of 2023. 
I guess the final point I would make here, Devin, is my expectation, as we've been working our way through this and translating those plans into action is we'll find more opportunities. I would expect it will beat the target, the plans that we put out there. We've got work going on now that kind of goes across the corporation. 
I mentioned the fact that we have structurally change the way we run our businesses. That change has now aligned each of the sectors in terms of how we're organized and a lot of the processes that were used to execute the business. That gives us an opportunity to take advantage of this consistency and processes and execution and find additional efficiencies and synergies, and that works underway, which we'll continue to develop as we move through this year, and I suspect we'll have more to talk about as we finalize our plans for the year at the back end and into the next year's Investor Day. 
So I'm real optimistic that the groundwork that we've laid since 2017 and looking at the businesses and how we reorganize are paying dividends today and are going to continue to pay dividends well into the future."

And thanks for the question, Roger. I would say first quarter performance in Chemicals, first and foremost, reflects that organization's focus on running their operations reliably and safely, a lot of hard work to make sure that the integrity of the operations and the reliability of those operations are maintained. 
And we did a lot of work over last year. And I think moving into the first quarter, that focus has really helped our manufacturing facilities deal with the freeze and recover very rapidly from that. So real proud of that effort. It wasn't easy, but that organization really delivered. 
I think the other thing it demonstrates is the focus that they've had for several years on growing their high-performance products. And we knew that the demand for chemicals has been consistently strong and has been growing in excess of GDP growth around the world. And that fundamental, we think, will continue for some time since chemical plays such an important role in people's modern life and the convenience of the modern life and actually the critical importance of some of the products that Chemicals make. 
Of course, the -- so the big challenge there, though, is as supply comes on in fairly large chunks with different plants, that tends to result in supply and demand imbalances and lower margins. And of course, we saw that last year. And frankly, going into this year, we kind of anticipated a lot of capacity coming on, which would squeeze the margins and make for a challenging year. 
I think what we've seen is with the impact of last year and the pullback in spending that was required due to the pandemic and then probably exacerbated by the Texas storm here with all the capacity in the Gulf Coast area, the supply has gotten pretty tight as demand has continued to move. And then with the economic recovery and the rebound that we're seeing, that's put some more demand into the system. So it's -- I think the first quarter reflects good operations, good performance, good focus on growing our high-performance products and some really helpful market conditions from a supply and demand standpoint. 
My expectation as you move forward is we'll see some of that supply come back on a recovery from the ice storms and some of this new capacity that was deferred will start to make its way back into the market, and that will help probably ease some of the tightness. But our expectation is we'll continue to see a pretty good market here this year for the Chemical business."

Well, as we've said, with our capital allocation priorities, there's 3 legs to the stool, so to speak. And, obviously, really important for the foundation of success for the future is investing in the right projects, particularly in the Upstream with the depletion nature of that business. We've got to find industry advantaged investment opportunities. In the Chemical business, making sure that we're investing in the high-performance products that meet the demand, the growing demand that we're seeing around the world. And in the Downstream, investing in strategic sites to high-grade their production and make sure that the production is in line with the demand in the marketplace. 
And so that's critical element, and that's something that we stay focused on as we went through 2020, making sure that we didn't compromise the value of that particular capital allocation priority. The dividend, obviously, a critical part of that, and sustaining that dividend was a commitment that we've had for a long, long time, and we stay committed to that. So that's obviously going to be an important factor going forward. And then the balance sheet is making sure that we maintain the capacity to ride through the commodity cycles and not compromise those first 2 priorities that I talked to you about. And that's what we did in 2020. 
Obviously, the pandemic was a very unusual year, much deeper than any typical commodity cycle. So we had to lean harder on that than we normally would. We're very committed now to making sure that we rebuild that in anticipation of future commodity cycles. 
I think what we said during the Investor Day was we're going to shoot for something between 20% and 25% debt to capital. And that still feels like a reasonable place to be, and we'll work our way towards that as we go through this year and probably into next -- obviously, depending upon the price and margin environment that we find ourselves in."

And so if you remember how we did that breakeven as we made some assumptions about kind of low end of Chemical and Downstream margins and then average chemical margin and downstream margins going forward. And recognizing that, that wasn't necessarily forecast, it was just one way to characterize it. 
And the important point we were trying to make, and I think we've made historically, is as you look at our breakeven, you can't just focus on the crude price that we've got significant businesses in both the Downstream and Chemicals that obviously impact that. I would say we haven't tried to update that number. I think what we tried to do with the Investor Day is just give you and others the confidence that with our portfolio and the plans that we had, we were robust to a very wide range of prices. The fact that the chemical margins are as good as they are today, says that, that breakeven has come down. But frankly, we're not really sharpening our pencils anymore on that because we've got a plan, and the foundations of that plan haven't changed. I just think we feel better about the position that we're in today, given where the market is at. We'll take advantage of it while it's here. But I would tell you that our plans aren't based on those sustaining themselves. 
And as I said, we will pay down the debt and deleverage faster given the help that we're getting from the market right now. That's just put us in a stronger position for the future."

What we're seeing in the Permian and the point that I tried to make in the slide in the prepared remark is what's changed really is the progress that the improvements that, that business is making. 
And what the chart shows you, I think, is really, really impressive performance stuff that we had talked about. And I believe in reorganizing and better leveraging our technology, better leveraging the competencies of the entire organization in this very important resource that we would see significant improvements with time. I think I've been talking about that now for several years. And what that organization is demonstrating is, indeed, they are making improvements and making them at a faster rate than we had planned. And so that update with the production is a function of that performance improvement. We have not increased the capital allocation to that business. They're basically running at their planned spend. And obviously, that is -- that plan is across the full year, and that number will be -- will change over the year based on their plan."

We've got plans through 2025 with specific numbers. We're not managing the business to ranges. We have plans. And those ranges frankly reflect the recognition that -- this is -- we got a big business, a lot of variables impacting our projects. Things are going to move, and we can't precisely call exactly when things will occur, but we've got a pretty good basis for that, and that's the plan. And that range that we're showing reflects what I would say is how all these pieces tend to kind of come together and manifest themselves in any one quarter or a year. And so that range gives us, I think, right kind of flexibility to make sure that what we're talking to you about, some of that inherent variability in the plan. 
So we're not kind of wondering which end of that range we'll be at. We've got plans within that range and what I said continues to be the case that we're focused on delivering on those plans. I think the way to think about the spending is recognize we put these plans together, and reviewed them initially with the Board in October and finalize them in November and then very quickly came out with the release that talked about that. 
If you think about the October time frame and where prices we're at, reflect on the chart that I showed you, there was uncertainty as to exactly how the future would manifest itself. We knew that recovery would come just based on some of those underlying fundamentals, but really difficult to call. 
So our plans basically were more back-end loaded. And so what you're seeing in the first quarter is a reflection of the recognition that while things will recover, that we may still have some very challenging times here in the first quarter and into the second quarter, so making sure that we were building plans that comprehended that and anticipated that and would be robust to that. And so that's kind of how we built and why the numbers that you see in the first quarter are lower than maybe what would be a ratable run rate is because we had anticipated a probably more challenging environment than certainly that we're seeing today. So that will ramp up. 
I think the other point I'd make, Phil, is just the point I made about our pace projects and the good work that our project organization did and thinking through, given a portfolio of very attractive, high-return projects. And as I said, we tested all those informed by what we are seeing with the pandemic, tested whether or not they were going to generate the returns and bring the value that we had expected, and all of them continue to look attractive. And so we wanted to make sure that in the short term, we can serve spend to respond to the challenges of the pandemic, but make sure that we didn't compromise that longer-term value. 
And that was the real challenge of last year and the plans that we laid out reflect that. And so as you move forward, in the back half of this year and into next year, what you're seeing is some of those projects resuming activities on those product -- projects and seeing that spend go up. And so that's, I think, how I would suggest you think about that, is feathering in those projects in a very managed way that our project organization is working very closely with our partners and contractors to make sure that we bring those things back online and get that work going in a very efficient and effective manner."

I think that project has opportunities to do both. If you -- again, what we've been talking about for some time, and I think if I go back a year ago, the litmus test with respect to whether or not the company was focused on managing the risk of climate change and position for an energy transition was whether or not you're investing in solar and wind. 
Frankly, I've been very encouraged at how quickly that conversation has evolved and the recognition that there remains a significant challenge above and beyond the rule that wind and solar and electric vehicles will play, which they will play an important role. But above and beyond that, how do you decarbonize some of these very difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and do it in a way that is efficient and the lowest cost to society. And so that's the work that, certainly, we've been talking about for some time and the work that we've been investing in with respect to technologies to bring down the cost of the technologies that we believe will be required to achieve that. That's the venture that we launched in 2018, our carbon capture venture to start looking at how we could commercialize some of that technology and start looking for opportunities around the world. So all that was happening with this view of what I would say is a business opportunity to meet an evolving demand of society, which is a reduction in CO2. 
And the way we're thinking about that, that's a new business. That's a new demand for that society, I think, is a strong desire for. And so we're at the early stages of a new business. And what we've put out there is the opportunity to leverage the skills that we have, the competencies that we've developed over decades, the experience that we have in bringing new ventures to market, working with governments and leveraging our own capabilities. And this Houston Ship Channel represents exactly that. 
And we'd be working with a number of companies and industries there, so collaborating with others, working with the government. And we -- our own facilities would be involved in that. So I think it's kind of a mix of all those things that you brought up, Phil. It's an opportunity to reduce our own emissions, an opportunity for others to contribute at scale and a cost-effective way to reduce their emissions. And then again, potentially, there is an emerging market for CO2 reduction credits, and maybe a way to meet that market demand as well. 
And so I think it's early to take a real sharp pencil and lay all that out, but we think the fundamentals are there. And it just becomes -- comes down to then working with the relevant parties to shape the policies and the frameworks and the constructs of that project to take advantage of that -- of those emerging fundamentals."

And so that portfolio of opportunities remains. We've been out actively marketing a number of those. And as you can imagine, last year really slowed that pace down just because of the number of buyers and I'd say the range of uncertainty with where the future was going. 
The way I'd characterize it today is we're continuing that activity on those assets. And I'd say the work that we did in 2020 puts us in a really good position this year. We did not compromise the value that we expected to achieve and that slowed things down. But I think as we go into this year, there's different view that's being taken on the future and the horizon and the price environment, which is generating more interest. And so the way I'd characterize it right now, same set of assets, a lot more interest and discussions happening. And we'll see if we can find the right buyer and settle on a value that's kind of a win-win proposition and that work goes on.

But I would also tell you that at the end of the day, we're very focused on maximizing our growth in shareholder value and so keeping a kind of a firm eye on the opportunity set. And if things develop, if market conditions drive an opportunity that would be accretive and consistent with the existing portfolio and the capital allocation priorities that we've talked about, then that would certainly be an opportunity that we'd look at. I don't think we take anything off the table when it comes to thinking about the future and how we might leverage our capacities. And then if we find somebody where we can find some synergies with their capabilities and ours and to take advantage of that and together grow value at a rate faster than we can organically. 
But I'll come back to and finish on the point that I started with is we -- the portfolio we've got is pretty attractive. It's going to -- whatever we do is going to have to compete with that attractive portfolio. We feel real good about that. We'll keep an eye open, but it's nice not to be in a position where we have to do something."

And hopefully, you can keep this up regularly, not just once a year. 
I guess my first question is just on the Board changes. Exxon has announced some changes to Board representation. You're obviously in the middle of a proxy contest going into the shareholder meeting. Can you just talk about, from your perspective, Darren, why you think that the current set of Boards -- the current Board best represents the interest of shareholders and some of the changes that you made and what these changes are able to deliver for the shareholder?"

So I've doubled from your once a year. With respect, I think, to the Board and how we think about that, first comment I would make is since I've bee",953,"Well, Neil, and I'd just start by pointing out, this is the second time this year I've been on the call. So I've doubled from your once a year. 
With respect, I think, to the Board and how we think about that, first comment I would make is since I've been in this job, been engaging with shareholders pretty consistently and listening to their perspectives and taking their feedback on. And I think as a result of that, you've seen quite a bit of change in terms of how we interface with the shareholders and in fact, with you and your community. So I think we are responding to the feedback that we get. 
I would tell you that every decision that the Board has made with new directors, and we've brought on 6 since I came into the chair in 2017 have all been in response to and related to the feedback that we've been getting to our shareholders. In terms of the types of competencies and skill sets that they think would benefit our company and managing for the future. And frankly, that continues to be an ongoing dialogue, and we continue to look for what are the capabilities and skills required to successfully manage a business like ours. 
If you look at the Board we have today, and how we -- the Board Affairs Committee goes through the processes, I think, first, you got to recognize this is a big business that spans the globe and also spans a number of different industrial sectors, consumer product sectors, very complicated, a lot of challenges across the different countries and across the different businesses. And so really look to make sure that the folks that we bring into the Board have the perspective and the experience of managing global businesses, complex businesses, ones that span the globe and ones that have the kind of challenges that we see. 
Obviously, if you look at the industry and our company over time, technology and the evolution of technology and how that applies to our business has been a really important part of the value creation that we've driven over the years and a really important part in terms of the future and how that evolves. And so technology and understanding the technology, engineering science is an important part of things that we look for in terms of the skills and capabilities of the investors of our Board members. 
If you think about the capital intensity of the business and how we are so intimately tied into economic growth in economies around the world and people standards of living, directors have had that experience in managing, I think, is important. And you can see that in some of our directors that have that experience in capital-intensive linked closely to economic activity. So that's important. 
And then I think the third point I would make is understanding of and experience in transitioning businesses. And from our perspective, it's not necessarily transitioning an energy company. It's transitioning business with fundamental drivers, how you think about the changes in those fundamental drivers and how you effectively respond to those changes while creating shareholder value. And if you look at the folks that we have on the Board, a number of our individuals have really pertinent and relevant experience to managing large corporations successfully through transitions, albeit potentially in different industries. 
We also look to bring on industry experience that I would tell you has been a capability and competencies that we've been working to fill for quite some time. It's challenging to find someone who has the relevant experience and can relate to all the businesses that we're in, the scale that we're in and the global coverage. And I think we were very lucky last year to engage with Wan Zul after he retired in the middle of 2020, and very pleased that he came on the Board and bring some of the experience from Asia, which is obviously a really important region for our company and the fact that that's where a lot of the growth is happening. So that was a big advantage. 
And then the final point I'll make with respect to some of the new directors that we brought on is thinking about a transition with all the uncertainties associated with it and the challenge is how to best allocate your capital in that space and make sure that, one, that you're moving the business in the direction consistent with some of those broader trends, but doing it in a way that protects shareholder value and generates returns. And so I think some of the new directors have got some really good -- a really good track record in thinking through and doing that and has been bringing some of that additional perspective to many of our existing directors who also have that capital allocation experience. 
And so I think we've got a really experienced Board with a lot of complementary skills. And the final point I would make, which is really, really important is the chemistry of the Board, the culture that we have, the willingness for those directors to work collectively, collaboratively to engage, discuss, debate, I think, is absolutely critical. And what we find today is our Board meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of exploring, debating and all done in a very constructive way, all done focused on driving -- ultimately driving value. And so it's, I think, a very healthy Board that respects one another, but is very focused at the same time in driving value. And they've been a big part in helping reshape the company and setting us on the path that we're on now."

I would think with Guyana, with respect to the potential of that resource base, it is -- we've talked about 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. I would tell you that is the current estimate and that I would expect it to grow. The recent announcement we made with Uaru-2 confirmed a deeper play. And so I think additional opportunity or suggestive of an additional opportunity and resources that we haven't fully quantified yet. So I think it's a very rich set of opportunities that we're going to continue to progress. 
And I wouldn't look for a big bang per se. I would look for a continued and steady progression of bringing those opportunities to market. I think we've laid out a plan that's pretty consistent with that, working very closely with the government and the people of Guyana to continue to progress that resource. And really bring a lot of economic opportunity to the country and the people of Guyana. And I think we're beginning to see the benefits of that manifest themselves, and we'll continue to contribute on a ratable basis there. So I would just say a good, steady drumbeat of improvement as we move through those development and those projects. I think today, we're talking a potential for 7 to 10 FPSOs, 6 projects online by 2027. So we feel really good about what we're finding in Guyana and a very constructive engagement with the government in terms of those developments. 
With respect to LNG, obviously, gas is going to continue to play a really important role. As economies around the world develop, populations grow, people standards of living grow is all going to require power generation, and gas is going to continue to play an important role, in part because it's a really good substitute for coal and the fact that it's got much lower emissions, obviously, and lower particulate. 
It also has the potential with time to basically be used in making hydrogen, and that could play a role going forward as well. So I think gas is going to continue to be a really important part as societies and economies grow and as we move into lower carbon future. 
And so in that context, the LNG opportunities remain an important part of the portfolio, and we continue to work very closely with the governments around progressing discussions on how we continue to build on the portfolio that we have and expand those opportunities and do it in a way that both benefits the countries and the communities in those countries but at the same time, are attractive to us and compete within our portfolio. And so that work goes on. We're continuing to have very constructive conversations. And I would expect to see those advance at a pace that's consistent with those conversations landing at the right frameworks for progressing those projects."

Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter. Starting with the extensive engagement the Board",750,"Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter. Starting with the extensive engagement the Board and I had with our shareholders in the months leading up to our annual meeting. We received some very explicit feedback that we found valuable and are incorporating in our plans as we move the company forward. In future, the directors, the management committee and I look forward to continuing the active shareholder engagement and discussing the good work going on at the company and the progress we are making on all fronts. 
Since our annual meeting, we welcomed our new directors. Greg Goff, Kaisa Hietala and Andy Karsner with a number of discussions that included myself, our Lead Director, Ken Frazier, other Board members and senior managers of the company. In June, we began the new members' onboarding process with in-depth reviews of our businesses and key topics such as our energy outlook and our approach to the energy transition. While the Board has met virtually on a couple of topics since the annual meeting, this week was the first in-person regular meeting of the Board. We had very substantive and productive discussions across both of the committees and the full Board that were informed by the extensive shareholder engagements of the past several months. I'm pleased to say that without exception, our Directors are focused on improving the performance of the company, addressing the challenges faced by our industry and increasing long-term shareholder value. There is very good alignment on the importance of leveraging the diverse experience and skills of the Board. The important role ExxonMobil will have in the transition, helping to lead to the development and deployment of critical technologies, advocating for necessary policy and making strategically and financially accretive investments. The need to improve transparency and engagement with our shareholders, actively listening and more explicitly addressing concerns and, of course, driving total shareholder return in both the short and long run. While there is still much to do, I think we're working from a very strong foundation. 
ExxonMobil is proud to be a global leader in the industry. As the energy system evolves with society's needs, we look forward to continuing our role as a leader, helping lead society through the transition leveraging the deep thinking and analytical rigor of our 20,000 scientists and engineers and the hard work of all of our people. 
Another important development in the quarter was the addition of Kathy Mikells to our management committee as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Board, the other members of the management committee and our entire organization, I want to welcome Kathy and express how excited we are to have her on board. She joins us formally next month and brings significant CFO and Investor Relations experience from her time at Diageo, Xerox, United Airlines and ADT. In addition to the financial functions, Kathy's portfolio will include corporate strategic planning, investor relations and a number of our global business services like IT and procurement. We look forward to the depth of experience and perspectives she'll bring. 
By welcoming Kathy, I'd like to also recognize Andy Swiger's retirement, which was also recently announced. I'd like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the many contributions Andy has made during his 43 years with the company. He has certainly earned his retirement, and we all wish him and his wife Sherry, the very best. 
Also of significance in the quarter was the continuing market recovery, which obviously underpins our results. As you will hear, the organization remains very focused on continuing to leverage the changes we've implemented over the last several years and on delivering the plans we've discussed with you in March. As the margin improves, we've maintained a disciplined approach doing more with less. We remain focused on delivering industry-leading operating performance, continuing to significantly reduce costs, advancing our portfolio of high return advantage projects, executing value-accretive investments and rebuilding the strength of our balance sheet. In addition, as the need for climate solutions beyond wind, solar and electric vehicles grow, we are working to expand our portfolio of strategically and financially accretive low-carbon solutions investments. While still in the early stages, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. I'll come back to this later in the call. 
At this time, I'll hand it back to Stephen."

Across all 3 businesses, demand recovery has improved results. In the Upstream, liquids realizations improved significantly versus the first quarter. Production was lower due to seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher scheduled maintenance activity, notably in Canada. We continue to explore and progress development in our advantaged deepwater assets with 2 discoveries announced in Guyana during the second quarter and a third discovery, Whiptail, announced this week. We also completed final investment decision for the Bacalhau development offshore Brazil. 
In the Downstream, global demand improved in line with economic recovery. However, we did see the impact of regional lockdowns resulting from COVID outbreaks. While there is improved demand for gasoline and diesel, margins continue to be impacted by product oversupply and depressed jet demand driven by lower international travel. 
The Chemical business achieved record quarterly earnings with strong reliability and high polyethylene and polypropylene margins, specifically in North America and Europe due to continued strong demand, tight industry supply and ongoing shipping constraints. 
During the quarter, we announced the sale of our global Santoprene business to Celanese for more than $1.1 billion. The transaction includes 2 manufacturing sites in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Wales and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 
Earnings improvements across all businesses resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of $2.7 billion in the quarter. Finally, our Low Carbon Solutions business signed 2 MOUs to progress large-scale carbon capture and storage projects in Scotland and France. 
Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of second quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of second quarter results relative to the prior quarter. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $4.7 billion, an increase of approximately $2 billion versus the first quarter, primarily due to higher prices and margins and strong reliability. There was a $700 million hurt compared to the prior quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy had not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings benefit of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Consistent with prior disclosures, planned maintenance activity impacted earnings by about $800 million in the quarter, and was partially offset by lower corporate expenses and favorable tax items. 
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results for each business. Upstream earnings improved more than $630 million compared to the first quarter. Higher prices increased earnings by about $1 billion, partially offset by mark-to-market impacts of unsettled derivatives. Tighter supply-demand balances increased liquids realizations by 12%. Gas realizations also increased, driven primarily by higher European and LNG gas prices. Increased planned maintenance, primarily in Canada and Australia impacted earnings by $360 million. 
Next quarter, we expect lower levels of planned maintenance. Other items were a help of $310 million and included favorable asset management and onetime tax items. 
On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of Upstream volumes. On average, Upstream volumes decreased by about 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter. Gas and liquids were both lower in the quarter with seasonal gas demand reductions primarily in Europe, lower entitlements due to higher prices and the planned maintenance activity that I mentioned earlier. These impacts were partially offset by improved reliability, primarily in Canada and the U.S. and recovery from winter storm impacts experienced in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 8. Downstream earnings improved by approximately $160 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $600 million but were partially offset by the unsettled mark-to-market impacts I mentioned earlier. We had our best ever lubricants quarterly earnings driven by improved base stock margins. We have also seen demand improve, particularly in North America retail fuels. During the quarter, planned maintenance and turnarounds reduced earnings by $220 million. We optimize the timing of our Downstream maintenance in the first half of 2021, which positions us well for the continuing economic recovery as we move through the year. We also benefited from the absence of the first quarter refinery to terminal conversion provision for our Altona, Australia and Slagen, Norway refineries, which was included in the other factor. 
Moving to Chemical on Slide 9. Chemical had its best ever quarterly earnings, delivering over $2.3 billion, more than a $900 million improvement versus the first quarter. Margins improved by approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting our continued reliable operations and tight industry supply conditions, particularly in the polyethylene and polypropylene markets in North America and Europe. Planned seasonal maintenance and turnarounds in Europe reduced earnings by $180 million. 
The next slide summarizes results versus the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the second quarter of last year, earnings increased by $7.7 billion, driven by a total price margin improvement of about $6.7 billion and increased sales of $802 million. We had $850 million in planned maintenance as we successfully stretched maintenance intervals out of 2020 into the first half of this year. This position us well for a continuing economic recovery in the second half of 2021. Structural efficiencies, lower corporate and financing expenses and favorable hedge benefits. 
Slide 11 provides further details on investing. Cash operating expenses were $18.7 billion during the first half of 2021. In addition to reducing structural costs by $3 billion in 2020, the company has captured over $1 billion in further structural savings in the first half of 2021. The company remains on pace to achieve through 2023 total structural cost reductions of $6 billion relative to 2019. The cost associated with turnarounds, winter storm repairs and other market and activity-based factors were a partial offset. 
Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $6.9 billion year-to-date. Consistent with our plans, we started the year with lower levels of investment to mobility for responding to market conditions. We remain on track with full year spending on the lower end of our $16 billion to $19 billion range. Investments in the second half of the year are expected to be higher due to the timing of spend for major Upstream and Chemical projects, including Guyana, Brazil, Permian and Chemical performance products. 
Moving on to the summary of cash flow on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.7 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this is up about $2 billion from the first quarter, reflecting continued market improvement and ongoing benefits of our cost reductions. 
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, total debt was reduced to $60.6 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date reductions to over $7 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash. 
Turning to Slide 13 for the third quarter outlook. In the Upstream, we expect higher volumes with lower planned maintenance. The sale of the U.K. Central and Northern North Sea assets is now expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. 
In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement with continued economic recovery, lower turnarounds and maintenance are planned for the quarter. 
In Chemical, we anticipate some easing and the tight supply-demand balance as industry downtime improves and additional capacity comes online. We also expect lower turnaround impacts next quarter. 
Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $600 million, and we anticipate further debt reductions if prices and margins remain at current levels. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack."
406338,1673855037,2356702,"Exxon Mobil Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Exxon Mobil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first 6 months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction. We've also made progress in o",2002,"Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first 6 months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction. We've also made progress in our efforts to reduce emissions, advance lower carbon solutions and further advance the depth and quality of our portfolio. 
I'll spend a few minutes providing some highlights and perspectives on this progress, and let's start with a look at the business environment. Second quarter saw a rapidly recovering environment with significant improvement in all our product markets. Oil and gas prices increased materially since the fourth quarter of last year, and we're back within the 10-year range, driven largely by economic recovery as the pandemic-related restrictions were relaxed. 
Downstream margins moved close to the low end of the 10-year band. They continue to be impacted by an unbalanced global refining system, resulting primarily from an oversupply of distillates from low international jet demand. Nonetheless, U.S. demand growth drove substantial improvements from the historic lows of the fourth quarter. Importantly, significant earnings potential remains as the Downstream continues to recover from the lingering effects of the pandemic. And to build on that point and demonstrate just how quickly things can change, Chemical prices and margins were far above the 10-year band and drove record earnings. Chemicals record results were driven by strong base reliability, robust demand and tight supply for both polyethylene and polypropylene in the North American and European markets. Looking ahead, although we anticipate lengthening of supply and rising feed across the regions, our outlook is for Chemical margins to remain strong in the coming months. 
Given the dynamic market and record results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking more deeply about the Chemical markets in our business. Starting with a closer look at the current market environment. The last 18 months have been a testament to the underlying resiliency in demand for Chemical products, and that is especially true in a surging global economic recovery as these products are widely needed for food packaging, hygiene and the recovering automobile sector, among others. This year, polyethylene and polypropylene margins across North America and Europe increased by more than 140% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The recovery in Asia has been more challenging due to pockets of COVID resurgence, higher supply and increased crude and naphtha prices. 
Strong margins in the Atlantic Basin are the result of several factors: first, hurricane impacts in late 2020, followed by Winter Storm Uri earlier this year, which reduced inventory levels; second, unplanned industry shutdowns and turnarounds; third, global shipping constraints of finished products caused by port congestion, container availability and increased shipping costs from Asia to the U.S.; and then finally, demand growth in the U.S. commensurate with growth in GDP. 
Our Chemical business has benefited from this tightness with 70% of our polyethylene capacity located in these regions. A material portion of this is typically exported to Asia, but was redirected to Europe and North America enabling us to capture more than our share of demand growth. The scale, global footprint and multitude of product lines in our Chemical business provides competitive advantage and strong earnings potential is amplified in tight markets like today, and is also durable when looking at long [indiscernible] ExxonMobil Chemicals earnings over the past decade were 80% higher than the industry average. In the first quarter, our earnings were double the industry average. And our second quarter result is materially higher than the first. The core strategy of our Chemicals business is growing technology-driven, higher-value performance products. These have proven, over the test of time, to add significant value for our customers versus commodity chemical products. 
Our diverse product offerings and global reach are significant advantages. ExxonMobil Chemical is #1 or #2 in more than 80% of the markets where we compete. This provides resiliency across a wide range of market scenarios and upside in a market like today. In addition to the product diversity, I want to highlight the benefits we've seen this year from 3 important drivers: first, our ability to optimize feed and unit operations at our integrated facilities and leverage regional feedstock supply chains has generated about $1.4 billion of earnings for the first 6 months of this year; second, as we discussed during Investor Day, we've sharpened our focus on making our Chemicals business a leader in cost efficiency. As a result, costs were down significantly in 2020. And even with the higher sales volumes this year, ongoing structural efficiencies such as digital enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies and previously announced staffing reductions are expected to support $1 billion in annual reductions versus 2019; and third, the recent advantaged project investments, including the world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker and polyethylene reactors delivered $600 million in earnings in the first half of this year. And there are more advantaged projects in flight today that will grow our supply performance products and have an even larger impact on earnings. These projects will grow our supply of performance products by 70% by 2027. And grow the earnings contribution by 100% due to the higher value slate of new products. These products bring significant benefits to our customers. They support lower emissions, improve the performance of technologies that enable the energy transition and improve efficiencies. And those advantages ultimately are reflected in higher margins. 
For example, polyethylene packaging has lower life cycle emissions compared to alternatives. Performance polyethylene like our Exceed XP is stronger, enabling thinner films for the same applications. We're developing the capability to produce certified circular polymers from plastic waste using our proprietary advanced recycling technology. And polypropylene used to reduce the weight of vehicles, improve fuel economy and battery life. 
The projects gained advantage not just from the higher-margin products they produce, but also from advantaged fee, scale, proprietary catalyst technology and the integration with our existing Chemical and Downstream facilities and logistics. 
Our focus going forward remains on advancing a number of major Chemical and also Downstream projects. It will further strengthen our integrated manufacturing platforms and upgrade our product mix to meet a range of future demand scenarios. As you may recall, many of these projects were paced to preserve cash during the market downturn last year. 
Our global projects organization has done an excellent job managing this activity to preserve long-term value. This group of projects are expected to still be completed within the FID estimate. As an aside, this is the same organization that we'll be delivering future carbon capture projects advancing through our Low Carbon Solutions business. This capability continues to be an enduring competitive advantage and will only increase in importance going forward. 
In the Chemical business, our large Corpus Christi Chemical complex is ahead of schedule and under budget. We just announced a mechanical completion of the 3 derivative units, including a monoethylene glycol unit and 2 polyethylene reactors. Full site start-up is anticipated by year-end. Progress is ongoing at the polypropylene growth project in Baton Rouge, start-up anticipated next year. Our Baytown Chemical Plant expansion will include a new Vista Max unit and a full range linear alpha olefins unit, is on track for a 2023 startup. Our China One Venture captures the advantage of being located in the world's largest growth market. We signed several important agreements to advance the project, including a contract with Sinopec for basic engineering design, procurement and construction. 
In the Downstream, we're moving crude to the Wink to Webster Pipeline from the Permian Basin and are preparing to ship third-party production in the fourth quarter of this year. At Beaumont, process unit modules are on site, and we're ramping up construction activity for start-up in 2023. And our Singapore and Foley projects are also progressing. However, they are a bit further out in terms of a full project restart. 
Even in the current challenging refining environment, these Downstream projects are still attractive and materially improve the competitiveness of our integrated sites. If these 4 projects were online at today's margins, they would be contributing more than $1 billion in annual earnings. For example, our Singapore Zidd project will produce 20,000 barrels a day of high-quality lube base stocks that would have added to our strong lubricants result this quarter. Collectively, this world-class Chemical and Downstream project portfolio delivers 30% returns at 10-year average margins. That's more than $4 billion of annual earnings at 10-year average margins and $2 billion of 10-year low margins. 
We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive Upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 400,000 oil equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans. 
Relative to 2019, we've more than doubled the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling a Delaware Basin 12,500-foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately 3x more efficient than in 2019. So another way to think about this is that the 8 rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just 2 years ago. Completions are improving, too. Our frac rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%. 
Our environmental performance also continues to improve. We achieved record low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantaged short-cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameter setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry-leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns and $35 a barrel or less. This low price resiliency also applies to our deepwater developments in Guyana and Brazil. 
In Guyana's Stabroek block, we've added 3 new discoveries since the first quarter, including the Whiptail discovery announced this week. The Uaru-2 well encountered 120 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoirs. The Longtail-3 well encountered 230 feet of net pay and both of these results included newly identified intervals below the zones originally discovered. Resource quantification is ongoing. 
The Whiptail-1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay and drilling is ongoing at the Whiptail-2 well, which has encountered 167 feet of net pay both in high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. This additional resource will add to the 9 billion oil equivalent barrels we discussed at Investor Day, further increasing our confidence in the resource size and quality in the area east of Liza and supporting our view of an ultimate block-wide footprint of 7 to 10 developments. The projects in progress remain on schedule with the expected arrival of the Liza Phase 2 Unity FPSO in Guyanese waters early in the fourth quarter. Payara, the third major development on the block is on track for a 2024 start-up with topside construction ongoing. And pending government approval, we're targeting a final investment decision on Yellowtail, our fourth major development later this year with startup planned for 2025. 
Offshore Brazil, we confirmed the final investment decision on the Bacalhau development during the second quarter. and expect this 220,000 barrel a day project to start up in 2024. It will deliver more than a 15% rate of return at $50 a barrel. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Darren to discuss our Low Carbon Solutions business and long-term plans."

Let me shift focus now to the wide range of activities we are pursuing to ensure ExxonMobil plays a key role in the energy transition while continuing to grow shareholder value. You'll recall that earlier this year, we established our Low Carbon Solutions business to develop potential carbon capture and storage opportunities using both established and emerging technologies and progress commercialization of other lower emissions technologies. We believe that the depth and breadth of our operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology gives us a competitive advantage in what is expected to be a fast-growing market for Low Carbon Solutions. 
We also believe that the time is right, given the developing market for emission reduction credits and growing recognition of the importance of carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels by both governments and investors, all critical for broad-scale commercialization. The new organization is making steady progress in developing a wide range of attractive opportunities weighted initially towards carbon capture storage. We provided a few examples here to give you a sense of the opportunities. 
Next year, we anticipate final investment decisions for a large CCS expansion at our LaBarge facility in Wyoming and a new carbon capture technology pilot associated with the Porthos project in Rotterdam. This quarter, we signed an MOU to explore the development of CO2 infrastructure to help decarbonize the industrial basin in the Normandy region of France, and an MOU to participate in the recently announced Acorn CCS project in Scotland. 
We are continuing to pursue several Gulf Coast opportunities, including our Houston Hub concept, which are all gaining industry and third-party support. In addition to carbon capture and storage, we're advancing a number of options to produce low emissions biofuels. These include new projects, repurposing existing refinery units, co-processing biofeeds and purchase agreements. These plans would enable the production of more than 40,000 barrels per day of low-emission fuels by 2025. 
We also recently completed a successful trial to co-process biofeed across our existing refining circuit. Coprocessing biofeed is a key technology that can be rapidly scaled to help society quickly lower emissions, provided the right policies are in place. In addition, during the quarter, we expanded a previous agreement with alternative fuels developer, Global Clean Energy, to annually purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel. This is basically a drop in lower carbon fuel that meets all finished product specs for today's engines. Commercial production is expected to begin next year. 
In markets where low carbon fuels policies incentivize the development of lower emission fuels like California and Canada, scale opportunities exist. We see the potential to leverage our existing facility footprint, proprietary catalyst technology and decades of experience in processing challenging feed streams to develop attractive low-emission fuels projects with competitive returns. An effectively designed low carbon fuel standard in the U.S. could accelerate significant CO2 reductions in the hard-to-abate transportation segment at a cost much lower than some existing policy. 
While we advocate for needed policies such as a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard and develop future projects, we continue to lead the industry in developing and deploying new technologies to address another important issue, reducing methane emissions. To that end, we have conducted more than 23,000 league surveys on more than 5 million components at over 9,500 locations. We are eliminating high-bleed pneumatic devices across our U.S. unconventional production and participating as a founding member and industry initiatives to improve detection and reduction of methane leaks. ExxonMobil is also the first company to file an application with the EPA to use airplanes equipped with methane detection technology to conduct large fly-over inspections, and we're evaluating satellite technology in support of our 2025 reduction plans for both methane intensity and absolute methane emissions. These ongoing efforts to commercialize low carbon solutions and reduce emissions are central to our long-term plan to grow shareholder value. As markets and policies continue to evolve, we will be there playing our part, contributing where we bring the most value. 
In the near term, as we begin the development of next year's plan, our organization is focused on continuing to deliver industry-leading operating performance, building on last year's record results in safety and reliability and extending our trend of annual reductions in emissions intensity by accelerating the pace of reductions and establishing more aggressive objectives. This will enable us to reduce our own emissions at a pace faster than what the countries have committed to under the Paris agreement. It will also help accelerate our objective of industry leadership in greenhouse gas performance by the end of the decade. Of course, we remain focused on sustained financial discipline. We are developing plans consistent with our existing commitments to deliver $6 billion of annual structural savings by the end of 2023, manage future capital investments, including new low carbon projects within previously announced CapEx ranges and restoring the strength of our balance sheet, returning debt to levels consistent with a strong AA rating. 
As our results demonstrate, we've made good progress in improving our competitiveness, but we're not satisfied. Our plans will focus on driving a further step change. We see a significant opportunity to capture scale and integration benefits from our recent reorganizations, improving efficiency, effectiveness and growing additional cash flow. 
To strengthen the earnings and cash flow potential of our assets, our plans will continue to advance high-return, advantaged projects and high-grade our existing assets through accretive divestments. Finally, as I have illustrated, we're stepping up and accelerating efforts to ensure the company plays a meaningful role in the energy transition. Our plans will reflect the continuing development and deployment of needed technologies, and where the appropriate incentives are in place, accretive investments. As we finalize our plans later this year, we'll provide additional updates with a more detailed review at our next Investor Day. 
Reflecting back on the past half year, we're pleased with the results the organization's hard work has delivered in a recovering market. We made a lot of progress as demonstrated by our year-to-date performance, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. We appreciate your participation in today's call and look forward to answering your questions."

Yes, I think the one point I would make in terms of a context to the response is it's fairly early in the process, as I said in my opening comments. We've only had the 1 meeting with the Board, but I would tell you that meeting was very encouraging. 
The other point I would make is actually the new Board has formed at a very good time with respect to our typical cycle with -- in managing the business. We have just kicked off our corporate plan process that runs through the end of November. And so we -- with the new Board, went through the basis of the plan and the objectives that we are setting ourselves. So we had an opportunity for a very rich conversation about that and what we need the organization to deliver this year and continuing this year and into next year and the years ahead. 
We also have a biannual strategy process that we have in place, which this year, we are doing in September and the new Board will basically have an opportunity to really dig into and go through the strategies that we've developed with all of our business, including our new business, Low Carbon Solutions and the broader corporate profile. So I expect, as we go through this year, to get a lot of good conversations about where the company is going, the opportunities that are ahead of us and where we want to put our emphasis. 
I think I would say the fundamental approach that we've taken is very, I'd say, it's a very good alignment amongst the board. I think they all recognize that the opportunity for us to take leadership role in this space is leveraging the capabilities and advantages we currently have. And so finding the opportunities that fit well with where we can add the most value is, I think, a very aligned objective amongst the Board. And of course, you've heard me talk about that, and I mentioned in my opening comments, the broader conversation that society is now having, governments are now having around the solution sets needed to address the transition, I think, opens the door to a much richer conversation about where ExxonMobil can play and contribute carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, biofuels, other areas potentially that leverage our strength. So I think we're -- things are lining up very well within the company. And then I would say more externally in the broader environment. 
With respect to CapEx and the balance sheet, as you mentioned, I think, again, good alignment around the importance of rebuilding the strength of the balance sheet. Everyone recognizes this is a commodity market with some significant cycles and volatility and making sure that we've got a balance sheet that we can lean on as we move through that volatile environment and manage the downs as well as the ups is a really important foundational piece of our strategy, and I think very good alignment on that, and that was reaffirmed in the conversations we had this week with our finance committee and the broader Board. 
And I think, too, given the improvements we've made around capital efficiencies, the work our global project organization has done to really make sure that we can deliver these projects with -- at a very advantaged cost. And we're very confident that we can do the things that we want to do, add some additional activities in the Low Carbon Solutions and do all of that within the range of CapEx that we've previously communicated. And I think, again, good alignment on that, and we'll confirm that as we move to the plan cycle and have those reviews with the Board later this year."

We'll be talking about that and the investments that we're planning going forward. And then, of course, the steel in the ground will come with time across the horizon that we typically talk about.

I'm going to hand it to Jack here to get maybe more specifics, but maybe a couple broader comments at your point that it is unusual given the consecutive quarters of challenging results in the Downstream. But I would also say going through the pandemic and losing over half of the jet demand coming out of the refining circuit is very unusual as well. And I think a very discrete and unique event associated with the global pandemic. So I think that context is really important to keep in mind as you think about our Downstream business and the results. 
The other point that I would just make with respect to your comment or question is, I think when you talk about the Downstream and compare across competitors, you've got to recognize the difference in the footprints and the investments in capital assets that we have. I would tell you as you look across our competitive group, we are much more heavily weighted in refining than some of our competitors. And so obviously, in an environment where refining margins are structurally down, performance is going to look different. And I think it's really important certainly what we focus on is making sure we normalize and understand what aspects are driving the performance. And I would say our capital structure, the investments that we've made over the years are a really important part of that. 
I would also tell you that what I refer to as the physics of this business is you can't stay at these low levels and continue with the level of supply that has historically existed in the Downstream. And you see that today with the shutdowns that are occurring in the industry. And so while that takes some time, this market will come back into balance. And if it's anything like we've seen accrue when that economic recovery kicks in, we're going to see supply and demand tighten, I suspect, and I think we'll see a different level of performance with respect to the Downstream and with respect to our peers. But obviously, that will be a function of that balance and when that economic recovery comes back around again. 
And I'll just make one final point in terms of -- we're not relying on just the cycle. We recognize the impact of the cycle, but I can assure you that, that Downstream organization is very focused on ensuring that we're pulling as many value levers as we can in the right way to build sustained and structural improvements that will benefit us, obviously, in this down cycle, but also in the upcycle. 
With that, let me turn it over to Jack, if I left you anything Jack."

We do have quite a bit of exposure that marked about in the full quarter, how historically low that was, and we are seeing some recovery. But due to the jet demand, that's going to take a little bit of time. 
I did mention in my prepared remarks that these new investments that we are making will help and the recent ones we have made have helped. The Rotterdam investment has made a couple of hundred million dollars this year and that will continue to help. So we are investing to continue to grow advantage in our -- in what is it difficult right now, fuels value chain, but picking up on the Rotterdam comment, our lubricants business has done quite well over the past couple of years. As a matter of fact, having a record year last year and extremely strong results so far this year. So that is a kind of balance to the fuels -- a tough refining fuels market. 
We -- I mentioned the integration of our refining with our Chemicals. 75% of our refineries are integrated with Chemicals and others are in advantaged market. So we're making sure -- we want to make sure that the refineries we have going forward are advantaged. And that's what these investments are about making sure the ones that we think are -- have natural advantages we build on those advantages. 
And then just in terms of Darren, I'm at about kind of the physics that we're finding. We've seen about almost 3 million barrels a day of rationalization over the past year, 18 months. So it's definitely quite a bit above where it has been historically, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. But we are seeing a slow -- slower than we hoped recovery filing environment."

And maybe just as, I think, very important context, understand what's enabled that change revolution. And I've talked before, I think, with all of you about the reorganizations and the consolidations and the changes that we've been making and how we run the business. 
If you look at the senior -- the corporate officers in the organization, we reduced that group by almost 40% over the years in terms of as we simplify the business, line up the value chains, reduce the overhead. We're able to make significant simplifications in that structure and then reduce numbers. And that also allows us to concentrate and consolidate some of the responsibility. So as we've made those changes with time, we've been able to shape the portfolio of the management committee members and focus them on core areas. And so we're in a position today where, as we've consolidated those responsibilities and focus them that we're creating a management committee position that's much more aligned today with what would be typical CFO-type responsibilities versus the past where we had much broader number of businesses and therefore, a much broader reporting relationship up into Dallas. So that simplification has enabled our ability to focus and bring these portfolios in line with what would be some more industry standard opportunities, which then led us through board discussions last year, to start thinking about how we can expand the capabilities, the skill sets, the experience on the management committee and bringing what we think is some relevant experience into a portfolio that's consistent with and shaped with outside industry experience. And obviously, understanding the industry is going to be an important role for that. I think we've got a pretty capable team, an organization that understands that industry very well that's going to support Kathy, with respect to that as she comes with a learning curve there. But I also think she'll bring in a lot of perspective from the outside, that's very relevant to the business along some of those core areas, including procurement and supply chains and some of the other areas of responsibility. So I think there's -- that change in our structure and approach to running the business has opened up some nice opportunities, and we think bringing in that diversity of thought experience and perspective is actually going to benefit. And obviously, we'll supplement that with our industry knowledge. So I think the mix will be a very powerful combination."

If you can bear with me for a minute to address the 800 tonne gorilla in the room, which obviously was the Board changes. The press that have us believe that you lost a climate fight, but all the discussions we've had with some of your large shareholders suggest it was an issue of capital discipline, spending, dividend protection. And my question really is that Exxon is already a leader in carbon capture. You're already leading through the methane partnership. You've been doing a lot of things for a long time. And you have got one of the best portfolio of growth opportunities in the industry that can drive sustainable dividend growth. A lot of your peers mismanage the cycle. Now some might say you spent a little bit too aggressively, the bottom line is you've still got those opportunities. So can you give us some assurances that just to pick a box, you are not going to sacrifice returns relative on a relative basis across the portfolio?"

That has been a primary focus for us for a long, long time, and certainly when I've been in the job. And as you know from past conversations, the work that we've been doing to reshape the organization to get more effective at running the business. And then importantly, recapitalizing the business with advantaged assets and supply has been a really important focus. And I think the work that we've done in the past has put us in a very solid position to continue to contribute I think everybody on the board is realistic with respect to the challenges facing society with this transition and the work that's going to be required by everybody, ourselves, the rest of industry, governments around the world, other industries and consumers to make changes on that transition, and that will take time. 
And I think as you look at a lot of independent third parties assessments, they all recognize that this is a challenging area that's going to require a lot of work and expertise in that our industry has an important role to play in helping with that transition, but very importantly, in continuing to meet the need for energy and existing sources of energy. And so that's the balance that we're trying to strike. And of course, I think one of the -- and how that transition evolves and the uncertainty associated with obviously everyone to take a different view on that, our view is the way you help manage some of that uncertainty while you're continuing to meet current demand is make sure that what you're doing is very advantaged. 
And on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, which is what we've been focused on, what we've been talking about. So we think we've got a really good portfolio of high-return projects that are advantaged versus the rest of industry. And so as time goes on and that uncertainty begins to manifest itself, we think, irrespective of how that -- the shape of that curve, we're still going to be in a very good position. And so I think strong recognition within the board that that's the advantage that we've created. And I think commitment to continue to leverage that advantage as we look at opportunities in this space of transition. 
And the final point I would make to try to reassure you, Doug, is I think one of the -- if you go back 18 months, I would say, the litmus test for whether or not somebody was committed to helping manage the transition was whether we are investing in solar and wind. Of course, we were concerned about the returns you could generate in that and the value that we bring to that sector. My sense is over the last 18 months, the broader conversation has quickly evolved and there's this recognition today that more solutions are needed and solutions that fit into our skill set and solutions where we have been working on creating advantage. So I'm confident that as the need for carbon capture is recognized and projects are being advanced in that space whether for biofuels or hydrogen, that the work that we've done on the technology and the fundamentals of carving out advantage there that we will generate an above industry, above average return for the things that we do in that space."

And what we're doing, I think, an even better job in recent years, looking at that whole portfolio together. And for instance, the Singapore project is both a Downstream and a Chemicals project and see more of those, I think, where we're involving both sides of the business and creating additional value there. 
So I think that integration, we view as a real strength going forward. As you think about the whole energy transition and as we move forward there, I think it's going to be even more valuable as we think about molecule management and increasing the value of all those molecules coming into our integrated complexes."

We're really improving the development efficiency in the Permian, really hitting on all cylinders, getting the sort efficiency that we've been targeting for the last couple of years and really hitting those 3 priorities we talked about in terms of increasing cash flow and capital efficiency and really driving down those development costs. 
So as we look going forward the Permian, we're going to be looking at making sure we hold on to those efficiencies that we've captured, making sure that we -- those are sustainable.

But we had committed last year to start a more  of a continuum in discussions and talking and put less emphasis on the Investor Day big bang and more what I would say is a continuing dialogue about where the business is going. And so after we had our plan endorsed by the Board, we put out a press release that gave some highlights. I talked about it in our fourth quarter call and rolled into the Investor Day. 
I would tell you, that continues to be the new approach that we want to take. I think that was reinforced by a lot of the discussions that we had with shareholders and this desire for continued transparency and more engaged dialogues. And so we're committed to continuing to do that. 
My expectation was as the Board goes through its deliberations as our organization develop plans and options that you're going to see more of a continuum in the discussion and the evolution of those plans going forward. I think, again, I'd just reiterate, if you look at the foundational elements of our strategy, which is really leveraging the strengths of our corporation, the technology, the ability to scale our project's organization, the capital capabilities that we have. A lot of those fundamentals, those have not changed. And the work that we are doing in technology to advance what we believe we're going to be important solutions to address transition -- the transition, that hasn't changed. In fact, what I would tell you is there's probably even more appetite around that. So if you think about the fundamentals of what we can bring to the equation and then what's needed, given that those remain fairly constant, I think I wouldn't see huge shifts in the strategy, but you may see acceleration, additional emphasis scenarios and continuing to leverage on those cores and how they manifest themselves. 
We're committed to leveraging the new perspectives and experience and capabilities we brought into the Board. That was part -- in part some of the reasons that we made some of those changes. And so we've got a really good experience set today and how we leverage that and our thinking and what opportunities that develops, I think will come out of our strategy and planned discussions, and we'll talk to you all about that as that thinking evolves and gets translated into plans and actions."

But if we look at your peer that reported today, they returned about the same amount of net income on a lower production volume number. And I know at any quarter, there's moving parts and doing an exact comparison is a little bit unfair. But it is a meaningful number of equality across 2 different companies. And I was wondering, as you think about the OpEx savings to come, that $3 billion and the Q2 performance, kind of where you think you are today and where you think you might be by the end of '23 when all that's run through as we think about profitability of the upstream?"

First of all, I'd link back to the comment that we had in the Downstream, not all volumes are created equal. And so when you talk about Upstream and volumes, I think you really got to step back and look at the mix of those volumes and the resource types that you're in and the location of the resources. And so I think, again, while it ultimately is a function of what you deliver, and so no excuses there. It's just understanding that and what leverage you have to affect it, which ties into -- so I think you start with your portfolio and how do you feel about that and where the opportunities to improve it are, which comes back to the capital we've been investing in the Upstream with the view that we got -- we're focused on bringing in more profitable higher value barrels. And the divestment work that we've been doing, which we just touched on, which is taking the areas, the volumes and some of the projects were an asset that you feel like it may have a higher value to others and shifting those out of our portfolio. So that high-grading of the portfolio and the resulting change in the mix of our barrels and volumes, I think is a very important part of the equation. And one of the things we've been very focused on, I would just tell you, that is a big driver as you look across the competitive landscape, and one of the reasons why we've been so focused on that space. 
And then above and beyond that, when you think about the organizational construct, how you're managing that the focus that you've got end-to-end focus along that value chain. That has been a very big change that we've made in the organization. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that today and how we're running Upstream, and my expectation is we'll continue to see additional benefits manifest themselves with time. And that's -- with respect to effectiveness, and responding more effectively to market signals and delivering value there, and it's also a function of efficiency in terms of additional cost reduction. So I would expect to continue to see evolving, improving business in the upstream just as I expect to see that in our Chemical and Downstream business."

And then my second question is on Chemicals. It seems like the segment kind of has a lack of transparency with 2 respects. One in the performance product earnings and to on benefits to greenhouse gas emissions. So on the performance products, can you discuss what that's contributing currently if there was kind of an outsized benefit because of the overall chemicals environment strength? And what kind of a normalized earnings looks like moving forward in that performance products? 
And then related to emissions, you mentioned that the performance products really help with emissions reductions, but Exxon maybe doesn't get that benefit because it's not like a Scope 3 reduction or your own emissions reductions. Is there any thought to supporting kind of emissions reporting scheme that awards Exxon for producing products that helps the world reduce emissions even if it doesn't reduce your own emissions?

So it is an important part of the equation that we think about and continue to work. And I'm less focused on how you take credit for it and more focused on making sure that it happens. But I'll let Jack spend some more time on that. 
With respect to your capital allocation and the dividends, I would tell you that the foundational elements of our capital allocation remain unchanged with respect to making sure that we're finding high-return, industry-advantaged investments because that underpins basically everything else we do for the long term. We're a capital-intensive industry. And so you better be making sure that you've got a good program of investments of capital, particularly in the depletion side of the business. Maintaining the balance sheet has always been an important part. We drew down heavily, and that advantage paid off last year, and we're going to rebuild that. So as you said, that's part of our strategy. And then shareholders distributions have been the third leg of that stool, an important aspect. And so with respect to that, of course, you heard, we think we've got a good plan on our investments and the range that we'll be investing going forward. We're making good progress on the debt, particularly given the higher price environments than anticipated. And then on distribution, it is part of the conversation and the discussions we've had. I would tell you, we have always felt a very strong commitment to our base shareholders to deliver on a dividend, a reliable and growing dividend, and that continues to be part of the conversation. And I would say the Board would like to continue to deliver on that commitment. And so we continue -- we're committed to that, a reliable dividend and one that grows with time. 
And obviously, if we're maintaining capital in the range that we want, we get our debt back to levels that assure us the ability to ride through the cycles, and we've got a manageable dividend that's reliable and growing. Recognize any time you raise the dividend, that brings the burden up. We're going to continue to do that. But at the same time, they want to manage that, that total outlay in the dividend. And so buybacks and other distributions become part of that equation, particularly when to redistribute cash. So that's all on the table. And I think as we move through this year and depending on where price is at, those opportunities will grow in relevance. And with a capital program that's pretty well defined and a debt that -- objective that's pretty well defined, you've got this opportunity on distributions, I think the Board will continue to evaluate as we go forward."

Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter. Starting with the extensive engagement the Board",750,"Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter. Starting with the extensive engagement the Board and I had with our shareholders in the months leading up to our annual meeting. We received some very explicit feedback that we found valuable and are incorporating in our plans as we move the company forward. In future, the directors, the management committee and I look forward to continuing the active shareholder engagement and discussing the good work going on at the company and the progress we are making on all fronts.  
Since our annual meeting, we welcomed our new directors. Greg Goff, Kaisa Hietala and Andy Karsner with a number of discussions that included myself, our Lead Director, Ken Frazier, other Board members and senior managers of the company. In June, we began the new members' onboarding process with in-depth reviews of our businesses and key topics such as our energy outlook and our approach to the energy transition. While the Board has met virtually on a couple of topics since the annual meeting, this week was the first in-person regular meeting of the Board. We had very substantive and productive discussions across both of the committees and the full Board that were informed by the extensive shareholder engagements of the past several months. 
I'm pleased to say that without exception, our Directors are focused on improving the performance of the company, addressing the challenges faced by our industry and increasing long-term shareholder value. There is very good alignment on the importance of leveraging the diverse experience and skills of the Board. The important role ExxonMobil will have in the transition, helping to lead to the development and deployment of critical technologies, advocating for necessary policy and making strategically and financially accretive investments. The need to improve transparency and engagement with our shareholders, actively listening and more explicitly addressing concerns and, of course, driving total shareholder return in both the short and long run. While there is still much to do, I think we're working from a very strong foundation.  
ExxonMobil is proud to be a global leader in the industry. As the energy system evolves with society's needs, we look forward to continuing our role as a leader, helping lead society through the transition leveraging the deep thinking and analytical rigor of our 20,000 scientists and engineers and the hard work of all of our people.  
Another important development in the quarter was the addition of Kathy Mikells to our management committee as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Board, the other members of the management committee and our entire organization, I want to welcome Kathy and express how excited we are to have her on board. She joins us formally next month and brings significant CFO and Investor Relations experience from her time at Diageo, Xerox, United Airlines and ADT. In addition to the financial functions, Kathy's portfolio will include corporate strategic planning, investor relations and a number of our global business services like IT and procurement. We look forward to the depth of experience and perspectives she'll bring.  
While welcoming Kathy, I'd like to also recognize Andy Swiger's retirement, which was also recently announced. I'd like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the many contributions Andy has made during his 43 years with the company. He has certainly earned his retirement, and we all wish him and his wife Sherry, the very best.  
Also of significance in the quarter was the continuing market recovery, which obviously underpins our results. As you will hear, the organization remains very focused on continuing to leverage the changes we've implemented over the last several years and on delivering the plans we've discussed with you in March. As the margin improves, we've maintained a disciplined approach doing more with less. We remain focused on delivering industry-leading operating performance, continuing to significantly reduce costs, advancing our portfolio of high return advantage projects, executing value-accretive divestments and rebuilding the strength of our balance sheet. In addition, as the need for climate solutions beyond wind, solar and electric vehicles grow, we are working to expand our portfolio of strategically and financially accretive low-carbon solutions investments. While still in the early stages, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. I'll come back to this later in the call.  
At this time, I'll hand it back to Stephen."

Across all 3 businesses, demand recovery has improved results. In the Upstream, liquids realizations improved significantly versus the first quarter. Production was lower due to seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher scheduled maintenance activity, notably in Canada. We continue to explore and progress development in our advantaged deepwater assets with 2 discoveries announced in Guyana during the second quarter and a third discovery, Whiptail, announced this week. We also completed final investment decision for the Bacalhau development offshore Brazil.  
In the Downstream, global demand improved in line with economic recovery. However, we did see the impact of regional lockdowns resulting from COVID outbreaks. While there is improved demand for gasoline and diesel, margins continue to be impacted by product oversupply and depressed jet demand driven by lower international travel.  
The Chemical business achieved record quarterly earnings with strong reliability and high polyethylene and polypropylene margins, specifically in North America and Europe due to continued strong demand, tight industry supply and ongoing shipping constraints.  
During the quarter, we announced the sale of our global Santoprene business to Celanese for more than $1.1 billion. The transaction includes 2 manufacturing sites in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Wales and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.  
Earnings improvements across all businesses resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of $2.7 billion in the quarter. Finally, our Low Carbon Solutions business signed 2 MOUs to progress large-scale carbon capture and storage projects in Scotland and France.  
Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of second quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of second quarter results relative to the prior quarter. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $4.7 billion, an increase of approximately $2 billion versus the first quarter, primarily due to higher prices and margins and strong reliability. There was a $700 million hurt compared to the prior quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy had not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings benefit of these trading strategies when they close in the future.  
Consistent with prior disclosures, planned maintenance activity impacted earnings by about $800 million in the quarter, and was partially offset by lower corporate expenses and favorable tax items.  
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results for each business. Upstream earnings improved more than $630 million compared to the first quarter. Higher prices increased earnings by about $1 billion, partially offset by mark-to-market impacts of unsettled derivatives. Tighter supply-demand balances increased liquids realizations by 12%. Gas realizations also increased, driven primarily by higher European and LNG gas prices. Increased planned maintenance, primarily in Canada and Australia impacted earnings by $360 million.  
Next quarter, we expect lower levels of planned maintenance. Other items were a help of $310 million and included favorable asset management and onetime tax items.  
On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of Upstream volumes. On average, Upstream volumes decreased by about 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter. Gas and liquids were both lower in the quarter with seasonal gas demand reductions primarily in Europe, lower entitlements due to higher prices and the planned maintenance activity that I mentioned earlier. These impacts were partially offset by improved reliability, primarily in Canada and the U.S. and recovery from winter storm impacts experienced in the first quarter.  
Moving to Slide 8. Downstream earnings improved by approximately $160 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $600 million but were partially offset by the unsettled mark-to-market impacts I mentioned earlier. We had our best ever lubricants quarterly earnings driven by improved base stock margins. We have also seen demand improve, particularly in North America retail fuels. During the quarter, planned maintenance and turnarounds reduced earnings by $220 million. We optimize the timing of our Downstream maintenance in the first half of 2021, which positions us well for the continuing economic recovery as we move through the year. We also benefited from the absence of the first quarter refinery to terminal conversion provision for our Altona, Australia and Slagen, Norway refineries, which was included in the other factor.  
Moving to Chemical on Slide 9. Chemical had its best ever quarterly earnings, delivering over $2.3 billion, more than a $900 million improvement versus the first quarter. Margins improved by approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting our continued reliable operations and tight industry supply conditions, particularly in the polyethylene and polypropylene markets in North America and Europe. Planned seasonal maintenance and turnarounds in Europe reduced earnings by $180 million.  
The next slide summarizes results versus the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the second quarter of last year, earnings increased by $7.7 billion, driven by a total price margin improvement of about $6.7 billion and increased sales of $802 million. We had $850 million in planned maintenance as we successfully stretched maintenance intervals out of 2020 into the first half of this year. This position us well for a continuing economic recovery in the second half of 2021. Structural efficiencies, lower corporate and financing expenses and favorable tax items delivered additional earnings benefit.
Slide 11 provides further details on investing and cost management. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $18.7 billion during the first half of 2021. In addition to reducing structural costs by $3 billion in 2020, the company has captured over $1 billion in further structural savings in the first half of 2021. The company remains on pace to achieve through 2023 total structural cost reductions of $6 billion relative to 2019. The cost associated with turnarounds, winter storm repairs and other market and activity-based factors were a partial offset.  
Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $6.9 billion year-to-date. Consistent with our plans, we started the year with lower levels of investment to provide flexibility for responding to market conditions. We remain on track with full year spending on the lower end of our $16 billion to $19 billion range. Investments in the second half of the year are expected to be higher due to the timing of spend for major Upstream and Chemical projects, including Guyana, Brazil, Permian and Chemical performance products.  
Moving on to the summary of cash flow on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.7 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this is up about $2 billion from the first quarter, reflecting continued market improvement and ongoing benefits of our cost reductions.  
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, total debt was reduced to $60.6 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date reductions to over $7 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash.  
Turning to Slide 13 for the third quarter outlook. In the Upstream, we expect higher volumes with lower planned maintenance. The sale of the U.K. Central and Northern North Sea assets is now expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals.  
In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement with continued economic recovery, lower turnarounds and maintenance are planned for the quarter.  
In Chemical, we anticipate some easing and the tight supply-demand balance as industry downtime improves and additional capacity comes online. We also expect lower turnaround impacts next quarter.  
Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $600 million, and we anticipate further debt reductions if prices and margins remain at current levels.  
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack."
406338,1673855037,2356851,"Exxon Mobil Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Exxon Mobil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first 6 months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction. We've also made progress in o",2009,"Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first 6 months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction. We've also made progress in our efforts to reduce emissions, advance lower carbon solutions and further advance the depth and quality of our portfolio.  
I'll spend a few minutes providing some highlights and perspectives on this progress, and let's start with a look at the business environment. Second quarter saw a rapidly recovering environment with significant improvement in all our product markets. Oil and gas prices increased materially since the fourth quarter of last year, and we're back within the 10-year range, driven largely by economic recovery as the pandemic-related restrictions were relaxed.  
Downstream margins moved close to the low end of the 10-year band. They continue to be impacted by an unbalanced global refining system, resulting primarily from an oversupply of distillates from low international jet demand. Nonetheless, U.S. demand growth drove substantial improvements from the historic lows of the fourth quarter. Importantly, significant earnings potential remains as the Downstream continues to recover from the lingering effects of the pandemic. And to build on that point and demonstrate just how quickly things can change, Chemical prices and margins were far above the 10-year band and drove record earnings. Chemicals record results were driven by strong base reliability, robust demand and tight supply for both polyethylene and polypropylene in the North American and European markets. Looking ahead, although we anticipate lengthening of supply and rising feed across the regions, our outlook is for Chemical margins to remain strong in the coming months.  
Given the dynamic market and record results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking more deeply about the Chemical markets in our business. Starting with a closer look at the current market environment. The last 18 months have been a testament to the underlying resiliency in demand for Chemical products, and that is especially true in a surging global economic recovery as these products are widely needed for food packaging, hygiene and the recovering automobile sector, among others. This year, polyethylene and polypropylene margins across North America and Europe increased by more than 140% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The recovery in Asia has been more challenging due to pockets of COVID resurgence, higher supply and increased crude and naphtha prices.  
The strong margins in the Atlantic Basin are the result of several factors. First, hurricane impacts in late 2020, followed by Winter Storm Uri earlier this year, which reduced inventory levels; second, unplanned industry shutdowns and turnarounds; third, global shipping constraints of finished products caused by port congestion, container availability and increased shipping costs from Asia to the U.S.; and then finally, demand growth in the U.S. commensurate with growth in GDP.  
Our Chemical business has benefited from this tightness with 70% of our polyethylene capacity located in these regions. A material portion of this is typically exported to Asia, but was redirected to Europe and North America enabling us to capture more than our share of demand growth. The scale, global footprint and multitude of product lines in our Chemical business provides competitive advantage and strong earnings potential is amplified in tight markets like today, and is also durable when looking at longer time frames. ExxonMobil Chemicals earnings over the past decade were 80% higher than the industry average. In the first quarter, our earnings were double the industry average. And our second quarter result is materially higher than the first. The core strategy of our Chemicals business is growing technology-driven, higher-value performance products. These have proven, over the test of time, to add significant value for our customers versus commodity chemical products.  
Our diverse product offerings and global reach are significant advantages. ExxonMobil Chemical is #1 or #2 in more than 80% of the markets where we compete. This provides resiliency across a wide range of market scenarios and upside in a market like today. In addition to the product diversity, I want to highlight the benefits we've seen this year from 3 important drivers: first, our ability to optimize feed and unit operations at our integrated facilities and leverage regional feedstock supply chains has generated about $1.4 billion of earnings for the first 6 months of this year; second, as we discussed during Investor Day, we've sharpened our focus on making our Chemicals business a leader in cost efficiency. 
As a result, costs were down significantly in 2020. And even with the higher sales volumes this year, ongoing structural efficiencies such as digital enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies and previously announced staffing reductions are expected to support $1 billion in annual reductions versus 2019; and third, the recent advantaged project investments, including the world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker and polyethylene reactors delivered $600 million in earnings in the first half of this year. And there are more advantaged projects in flight today that will grow our supply performance products and have an even larger impact on earnings. These projects will grow our supply of performance products by 70% by 2027. And grow the earnings contribution by 100% due to the higher value slate of new products. These products bring significant benefits to our customers. They support lower emissions, improve the performance of technologies that enable the energy transition and improve efficiencies. And those advantages ultimately are reflected in higher margins.  
For example, polyethylene packaging has lower life cycle emissions compared to alternatives. Performance polyethylene like our Exceed XP is stronger, enabling thinner films for the same applications. We're developing the capability to produce certified circular polymers from plastic waste using our proprietary advanced recycling technology. And polypropylene used to reduce the weight of vehicles, improve fuel economy and battery life.  
The projects gained advantaged not just from the higher-margin products they produce, but also from advantaged fee, scale, proprietary catalyst technology and the integration with our existing Chemical and Downstream facilities and logistics.  
Our focus going forward remains on advancing a number of major Chemical and also Downstream projects that will further strengthen our integrated manufacturing platforms and upgrade our product mix to meet a range of future demand scenarios. As you may recall, many of these projects were paced to preserve cash during the market downturn last year.  
Our global projects organization has done an excellent job managing this activity to preserve long-term value. This group of projects are expected to still be completed within the FID estimate. As an aside, this is the same organization that we'll be delivering future carbon capture projects advancing through our Low Carbon Solutions business. This capability continues to be an enduring competitive advantage and will only increase in importance going forward.  
In the Chemical business, our large Corpus Christi Chemical complex is ahead of schedule and under budget. We just announced a mechanical completion of the 3 derivative units, including a monoethylene glycol unit and 2 polyethylene reactors. Full site start-up is anticipated by year-end. Progress is ongoing at the polypropylene growth project in Baton Rouge, start-up anticipated next year. Our Baytown Chemical Plant expansion will include a new Vistamaxx unit and a full range linear alpha olefins unit, is on track for the 2023 startup. Our China [ One Venture ] captures the advantaged of being located in the world's largest growth market. We signed several important agreements to advance the project, including a contract with Sinopec for basic engineering design, procurement and construction.  
In the Downstream, we're moving crude to the Wink to Webster Pipeline from the Permian Basin and are preparing to ship third-party production in the fourth quarter of this year. At Beaumont, process unit modules are on site, and we're ramping up construction activity for start-up in 2023. And our Singapore and [ Foley ] projects are also progressing. However, they are a bit further out in terms of a full project restart.  
Even in the current challenging refining environment, these Downstream projects are still attractive and materially improve the competitiveness of our integrated sites. If these 4 projects were online at today's margins, they would be contributing more than $1 billion in annual earnings. For example, our Singapore [ Zidd ] project will produce 20,000 barrels a day of high-quality lube base stocks that would have added to our strong lubricants result this quarter. Collectively, this world-class Chemical and Downstream project portfolio delivers 30% returns at 10-year average margins. That's more than $4 billion of annual earnings at 10-year average margins and $2 billion of 10-year low margins.  
We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive Upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 400,000 oil equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans.  
Relative to 2019, we've more than doubled the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling a Delaware Basin 12,500-foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately 3x more efficient than in 2019. So another way to think about this is that the 8 rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just 2 years ago. Completions are improving, too. Our frac rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%.  
Our environmental performance also continues to improve. We achieved record low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantaged short-cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameter setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry-leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns and $35 a barrel or less. This low price resiliency also applies to our deepwater developments in Guyana and Brazil.  
In Guyana's Stabroek block, we've added 3 new discoveries since the first quarter, including the Whiptail discovery announced this week. The Uaru-2 well encountered 120 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoirs. The Longtail-3 well encountered 230 feet of net pay and both of these results included newly identified intervals below the zones originally discovered. Resource quantification is ongoing.  
The Whiptail-1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay and drilling is ongoing at the Whiptail-2 well, which has encountered 167 feet of net pay both in high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. This additional resource will add to the 9 billion oil equivalent barrels we discussed at Investor Day, further increasing our confidence in the resource size and quality in the area east of Liza and supporting our view of an ultimate block-wide footprint of 7 to 10 developments. The projects in progress remain on schedule with the expected arrival of the Liza Phase 2 Unity FPSO in Guyanese waters early in the fourth quarter. Payara, the third major development on the block is on track for a 2024 start-up with topside construction ongoing. And pending government approval, we're targeting a final investment decision on Yellowtail, our fourth major development later this year with startup planned for 2025.  
Offshore Brazil, we confirmed the final investment decision on the Bacalhau development during the second quarter. And expect this 220,000 barrel a day project to start up in 2024. It will deliver more than a 15% rate of return at $50 a barrel.  
I'll now turn the call back over to Darren to discuss our Low Carbon Solutions business and long-term plans."

Let me shift focus now to the wide range of activities we are pursuing to ensure ExxonMobil plays a key role in the energy transition while continuing to grow shareholder value. You'll recall that earlier this year, we established our Low Carbon Solutions business to develop potential carbon capture and storage opportunities using both established and emerging technologies and progress commercialization of other lower emissions technologies. We believe that the depth and breadth of our operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology gives us a competitive advantage in what is expected to be a fast-growing market for Low Carbon Solutions.  
We also believe that the time is right, given the developing market for emission reduction credits and growing recognition of the importance of carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels by both governments and investors, all critical for broad-scale commercialization. The new organization is making steady progress in developing a wide range of attractive opportunities weighted initially towards carbon capture and storage. We provided a few examples here to give you a sense of the opportunities.  
Next year, we anticipate final investment decisions for a large CCS expansion at our LaBarge facility in Wyoming and a new carbon capture technology pilot associated with the Porthos project in Rotterdam. This quarter, we signed an MOU to explore the development of CO2 infrastructure to help decarbonize the industrial basin in the Normandy region of France, and an MOU to participate in the recently announced Acorn CCS project in Scotland.  
We are continuing to pursue several Gulf Coast opportunities, including our Houston Hub concept, which are all gaining industry and third-party support. In addition to carbon capture and storage, we're advancing a number of options to produce low emissions biofuels. These include new projects, repurposing existing refinery units, co-processing biofeeds and purchase agreements. These plans would enable the production of more than 40,000 barrels per day of low-emission fuels by 2025.  
We also recently completed a successful trial to co-process biofeed across our existing refining circuit. Coprocessing biofeed is a key technology that can be rapidly scaled to help society quickly lower emissions, provided the right policies are in place. In addition, during the quarter, we expanded a previous agreement with alternative fuels developer, Global Clean Energy, to annually purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel. This is basically a drop in lower carbon fuel that meets all finished product specs for today's engines. Commercial production is expected to begin next year.  
In markets where low carbon fuels policies incentivize the development of lower emission fuels like California and Canada, scale opportunities exist. We see the potential to leverage our existing facility footprint, proprietary catalyst technology and decades of experience in processing challenging feed streams to develop attractive low-emission fuels projects with competitive returns, and effectively designed low carbon fuel standard in the U.S. could accelerate significant CO2 reductions in the hard-to-abate transportation segment at a cost much lower than some existing policy.  
While we advocate for needed policies such as a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard and develop future projects, we continue to lead the industry in developing and deploying new technologies to address another important issue, reducing methane emissions. To that end, we have conducted more than 23,000 league surveys on more than 5 million components at over 9,500 locations. We are eliminating high-bleed pneumatic devices across our U.S. unconventional production and participating as a founding member and industry initiatives to improve detection and reduction of methane leaks. 
ExxonMobil is also the first company to file an application with the EPA to use airplanes equipped with methane detection technology to conduct large fly-over inspections, and we're evaluating satellite technology in support of our 2025 reduction plans for both methane intensity and absolute methane emissions. These ongoing efforts to commercialize low carbon solutions and reduce emissions are central to our long-term plan to grow shareholder value. As markets and policies continue to evolve, we will be there playing our part, contributing where we bring the most value.  
In the near term, as we begin the development of next year's plan, our organization is focused on continuing to deliver industry-leading operating performance, building on last year's record results in safety and reliability and extending our trend of annual reductions in emissions intensity by accelerating the pace of reductions and establishing more aggressive objectives. This will enable us to reduce our own emissions at a pace faster than what the countries have committed to under the Paris agreement. It will also help accelerate our objective of industry leadership in greenhouse gas performance by the end of the decade. Of course, we remain focused on sustained financial discipline. We are developing plans consistent with our existing commitments to deliver $6 billion of annual structural savings by the end of 2023, manage future capital investments, including new low carbon projects within previously announced CapEx ranges and restoring the strength of our balance sheet, returning debt to levels consistent with a strong AA rating.  
As our results demonstrate, we've made good progress in improving our competitiveness, but we're not satisfied. Our plans will focus on driving a further step change. We see a significant opportunity to capture scale and integration benefits from our recent reorganizations, improving efficiency, effectiveness and growing additional cash flow.  
To strengthen the earnings and cash flow potential of our assets, our plans will continue to advance high-return, advantaged projects and high-grade our existing assets through accretive divestments. Finally, as I have illustrated, we're stepping up and accelerating efforts to ensure the company plays a meaningful role in the energy transition. Our plans will reflect the continuing development and deployment of needed technologies, and where the appropriate incentives are in place, accretive investments.  
As we finalize our plans later this year, we'll provide additional updates with a more detailed review at our next Investor Day.  
Reflecting back on the past half year, we're pleased with the results the organization's hard work has delivered in a recovering market. We made a lot of progress as demonstrated by our year-to-date performance. And we're excited about the opportunities ahead. We appreciate your participation in today's call and look forward to answering your questions."

Yes, I think the one point I would make in terms of a context to the response is it's fairly early in the process, as I said in my opening comments. We've only had the 1 meeting with the Board, but I would tell you that meeting was very encouraging.  
The other point I would make is actually the new Board has formed at a very good time with respect to our typical cycle with -- in managing the business. We have just kicked off our corporate plan process that runs through the end of November. And so we -- with the new Board, went through the basis of the plan and the objectives that we are setting ourselves. So we had an opportunity for a very rich conversation about that and what we need the organization to deliver this year and continuing this year and into next year and the years ahead.  
We also have a biannual strategy process that we have in place, which this year, we are doing in September and the new Board will basically have an opportunity to really dig into and go through the strategies that we've developed with all of our business, including our new business, Low Carbon Solutions and the broader corporate profile. So I expect, as we go through this year, to get a lot of good conversations about where the company is going, the opportunities that are ahead of us and where we want to put our emphasis.  
I think I would say the fundamental approach that we've taken is very, I'd say, it's a very good alignment amongst the Board. I think they all recognize that the opportunity for us to take leadership role in this space is leveraging the capabilities and advantages we currently have. And so finding the opportunities that fit well with where we can add the most value is, I think, a very aligned objective amongst the Board. And of course, you've heard me talk about that, and I mentioned in my opening comments, the broader conversation that society is now having, governments are now having around the solution sets needed to address the transition, I think, opens the door to a much richer conversation about where ExxonMobil can play and contribute carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, biofuels, other areas potentially that leverage our strength. So I think we're -- things are lining up very well within the company. And then I would say more externally in the broader environment.  
With respect to CapEx and the balance sheet, as you mentioned, I think, again, good alignment around the importance of rebuilding the strength of the balance sheet. Everyone recognizes this is a commodity market with some significant cycles and volatility and making sure that we've got a balance sheet that we can lean on as we move through that volatile environment and manage the downs as well as the ups is a really important foundational piece of our strategy, and I think very good alignment on that, and that was reaffirmed in the conversations we had this week with our finance committee and the broader Board.  
And I think, too, given the improvements we've made around capital efficiencies, the work our global project organization has done to really make sure that we can deliver these projects with -- at a very advantaged cost. And we're very confident that we can do the things that we want to do, add some additional activities in the Low Carbon Solutions and do all of that within the range of CapEx that we've previously communicated. And I think, again, good alignment on that, and we'll confirm that as we move to the plan cycle and have those reviews with the Board later this year."

We'll be talking about that and the investments that we're planning going forward. And then, of course, the steel in the ground will come with time across the horizon that we typically talk about.

I'm going to hand it to Jack here to get maybe more specifics, but maybe a couple broader comments at your point that it is unusual given the consecutive quarters of challenging results in the Downstream. But I would also say going through the pandemic and losing over half of the jet demand coming out of the refining circuit is very unusual as well. And I think a very discrete and unique event associated with the global pandemic. So I think that context is really important to keep in mind as you think about our Downstream business and the results.  
The other point that I would just make with respect to your comment or question is, I think when you talk about the Downstream and compare across competitors, you've got to recognize the difference in the footprints and the investments in capital assets that we have. I would tell you as you look across our competitive group, we are much more heavily weighted in refining than some of our competitors. And so obviously, in an environment where refining margins are structurally down, performance is going to look different. And I think it's really important certainly what we focus on is making sure we normalize and understand what aspects are driving the performance. And I would say our capital structure, the investments that we've made over the years are a really important part of that.  
I would also tell you that what I refer to as the physics of this business is you can't stay at these low levels and continue with the level of supply that has historically existed in the Downstream. And you see that today with the shutdowns that are occurring in the industry. And so while that takes some time, this market will come back into balance. And if it's anything like we've seen accrue when that economic recovery kicks in, we're going to see supply and demand tighten, I suspect, and I think we'll see a different level of performance with respect to the Downstream and with respect to our peers. But obviously, that will be a function of that balance and when that economic recovery comes back around again.  
And I'll just make one final point in terms of -- we're not relying on just the cycle. We recognize the impact of the cycle, but I can assure you that, that Downstream organization is very focused on ensuring that we're pulling as many value levers as we can in the right way to build sustained and structural improvements that will benefit us, obviously, in this down cycle, but also in the upcycle.  
With that, let me turn it over to Jack. I don't know if I left anything Jack."

We do have at the largest refinery. We do have quite a bit of exposure that market we talked about in the full quarter, how historical low that was, and we are seeing some recovery. But due to the jet demand, that's going to take a little bit of time.  
I did mention in my prepared remarks that these new investments that we are making will help and the recent ones we have made have helped. The Rotterdam investment has made a couple of hundred million dollars this year and that will continue to help. So we are investing to continue to grow advantage in our -- in what is it difficult right now, fuels value chain, but picking up on the Rotterdam comment, our lubricants business has done quite well over the past couple of years. As a matter of fact, having a record year last year and extremely strong results so far this year. So that is a kind of balance to the fuels -- a tough refining fuels market.  
We -- I mentioned the integration of our refining with our chemicals. 75% of our refineries are integrated with Chemicals and others are in advantaged market. So we're making sure -- we want to make sure that the refineries we have going forward are advantaged. And that's what these investments are about making sure the ones that we think are -- have natural advantages we build on those advantages.  
And then just in terms of Darren's comment about [ kind of the physics that ] we're finding, we've seen about almost 3 million barrels a day of rationalization over the past year, 18 months. So it's definitely quite a bit above where it has been historically, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. But we are seeing a slow -- slower than we hoped recovery filing environment."

And maybe just as, I think, very important context, understand what's enabled that change revolution. And I've talked before, I think, with all of you about the reorganizations and the consolidations and the changes that we've been making and how we run the business. 
If you look at the senior -- the corporate officers in the organization, we reduced that group by almost 40% over the years in terms of as we simplify the business, line up the value chains, reduce the overhead. We're able to make significant simplifications in that structure and then reduce numbers. And that also allows us to concentrate and consolidate some of the responsibility. So as we've made those changes with time, we've been able to shape the portfolio of the management committee members and focus them on core areas. 
And so we're in a position today where, as we've consolidated those responsibilities and focus them that we're creating a management committee position that's much more aligned today with what would be typical CFO-type responsibilities versus the past where we had much broader number of businesses and therefore, a much broader reporting relationship up into Dallas. So that simplification has enabled our ability to focus and bring these portfolios in line with what would be some more industry standard opportunities, which then led us through Board discussions last year, to start thinking about how we can expand the capabilities, the skill sets, the experience on the management committee and bring in what we think is some relevant experience into a portfolio that's consistent with and shaped with outside industry experience. 
And obviously, understanding the industry is going to be an important role of that. I think we've got a pretty capable team, an organization that understands that industry very well that's going to support Kathy, with respect to that as she comes with a learning curve there. But I also think she'll bring in a lot of perspective from the outside, that's very relevant to the business along some of those core areas, including procurement and supply chains and some of the other areas of responsibility. So I think there's -- that change in our structure and approach to running the business has opened up some nice opportunities, and we think bringing in that diversity of thought experience and perspective is actually going to benefit. And obviously, we'll supplement that with our industry knowledge. So I think the mix will be a very powerful combination."

The press that have us believe that you lost a climate fight, but all the discussions we've had with some of your large shareholders suggest it was an issue of capital discipline, spending, dividend protection. And my question really is that Exxon is already a leader in carbon capture. You're already leading through the methane partnership. You've been doing a lot of things for a long time. And you have got one of the best portfolio of growth opportunities in the industry that can drive sustainable dividend growth. A lot of your peers mismanage the cycle.

That has been a primary focus for us for a long, long time, and certainly when I've been in the job. And as you know from past conversations, the work that we've been doing to reshape the organization to get more effective at running the business. And then importantly, recapitalizing the business with advantaged assets and supply has been a really important focus. And I think the work that we've done in the past has put us in a very solid position to continue to contribute I think everybody on the Board is realistic with respect to the challenges facing society with this transition and the work that's going to be required by everybody, ourselves, the rest of industry, governments around the world, other industries and consumers to make changes on that transition, and that will take time. 
And I think as you look at a lot of independent third parties assessments, they all recognize that this is a challenging area that's going to require a lot of work and expertise in that our industry has an important role to play in helping with that transition, but very importantly, in continuing to meet the need for energy and existing sources of energy. And so that's the balance that we're trying to strike. And of course, I think one of the -- and how that transition evolves and the uncertainty associated with obviously everyone to take a different view on that, our view is the way you help manage some of that uncertainty while you're continuing to meet current demand is make sure that what you're doing is very advantaged. 
And on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, which is what we've been focused on, what we've been talking about. So we think we've got a really good portfolio of high-return projects that are advantaged versus the rest of industry. And so as time goes on and that uncertainty begins to manifest itself, we think, irrespective of how that -- the shape of that curve, we're still going to be in a very good position. And so I think strong recognition within the Board that that's the advantage that we've created. And I think commitment to continue to leverage that advantage as we look at opportunities in this space of transition. 
And the final point I would make to try to reassure you, Doug, is I think one of the -- if you go back 18 months, I would say, the litmus test for whether or not somebody was committed to helping manage the transition was whether we are investing in solar and wind. Of course, we were concerned about the returns you could generate in that and the value that we bring to that sector. My sense is over the last 18 months, the broader conversation has quickly evolved and there's this recognition today that more solutions are needed and solutions that fit into our skill set and solutions where we have been working on creating advantaged. So I'm confident that as the need for carbon capture is recognized and projects are being advanced in that space whether for biofuels or hydrogen, that the work that we've done on the technology and the fundamentals of carving out advantaged there that we will generate an above industry, above average return for the things that we do in that space."

That's what -- from the Upstream perspective, that's what's going to be driving our results there. And I think the slide I showed pretty much demonstrated why that you're seeing that bottom line earnings improvement. We're really improving the development efficiency in the Permian, really hitting on all cylinders, getting the sort efficiency that we've been targeting for the last couple of years and really hitting those 3 priorities we talked about in terms of increasing cash flow and capital efficiency and really driving down those development costs. 
So as we look going forward the Permian, we're going to be looking at making sure we hold on to those efficiencies that we've captured, making sure that we -- those are sustainable. And they continue to work with technology there, and we see some additional benefits of technology being applied to that program. And as we do that, you get confidence with those benefits are sustainable, got the technology built in, then we'll be growing that program over time."

But we had committed last year to start a more of a continuum in discussions and talking and put less emphasis on the Investor Day big bang and more what I would say is a continuing dialogue about where the business is going. And so after we had our plan endorsed by the Board, we put out a press release that gave some highlights. I talked about it in our fourth quarter call and rolled into the Investor Day. 
I would tell you, that continues to be the new approach that we want to take. I think that was reinforced by a lot of the discussions that we had with shareholders and this desire for continued transparency and more engaged dialogues. And so we're committed to continuing to do that. 
My expectation was as the Board goes through its deliberations as our organization develop plans and options that you're going to see more of a continuum in the discussion and the evolution of those plans going forward. I think, again, I'd just reiterate, if you look at the foundational elements of our strategy, which is really leveraging the strengths of our corporation, the technology, the ability to scale our project's organization, the capital capabilities that we have. A lot of those fundamentals, those have not changed. And the work that we are doing in technology to advance what we believe we're going to be important solutions to address transition -- the transition, that hasn't changed. In fact, what I would tell you is there's probably even more appetite around that. So if you think about the fundamentals of what we can bring to the equation and then what's needed, given that those remain fairly constant, I think I wouldn't see huge shifts in the strategy, but you may see acceleration, additional emphasis scenarios and continuing to leverage on those cores and how they manifest themselves. 
We're committed to leveraging the new perspectives and experience and capabilities we brought into the Board. That was part -- in part some of the reasons that we made some of those changes. And so we've got a really good experience set today and how we leverage that and our thinking and what opportunities that develops, I think will come out of our strategy and planned discussions, and we'll talk to you all about that as that thinking evolves and gets translated into plans and actions."

And then dovetailing that with the expectation for the additional $3 billion of OpEx savings, which I have recognized is spread across the company. But if we look at your peer that reported today, they returned about the same amount of net income on a lower production volume number. And I know at any quarter, there's moving parts and doing an exact comparison is a little bit unfair. But it is a meaningful number of equality across 2 different companies. And I was wondering, as you think about the OpEx savings to come, that $3 billion and the Q2 performance, kind of where you think you are today and where you think you might be by the end of '23 when all that's run through as we think about profitability of the upstream?"

First of all, I'd link back to the comment that we had in the Downstream, not all volumes are created equal. And so when you talk about Upstream and volumes, I think you really got to step back and look at the mix of those volumes and the resource types that you're in and the location of the resources. And so I think, again, while it ultimately is a function of what you deliver, and so no excuses there. It's just understanding that and what leverage you have to affect it, which ties into -- so I think you start with your portfolio and how do you feel about that and where the opportunities to improve it are, which comes back to the capital we've been investing in the Upstream with the view that we got -- we're focused on bringing in more profitable higher value barrels. 
And the divestment work that we've been doing, which we just touched on, which is taking the areas, the volumes and some of the projects were an asset that you feel like it may have a higher value to others and shifting those out of our portfolio. So that high-grading of the portfolio and the resulting change in the mix of our barrels and volumes, I think is a very important part of the equation. And one of the things we've been very focused on, I would just tell you, that is a big driver as you look across the competitive landscape, and one of the reasons why we've been so focused on that space. 
And then above and beyond that, when you think about the organizational construct, how you're managing that the focus that you've got end-to-end focus along that value chain. That has been a very big change that we've made in the organization. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that today and how we're running Upstream, and my expectation is we'll continue to see additional benefits manifest themselves with time. And that's -- with respect to effectiveness, and responding more effectively to market signals and delivering value there, and it's also a function of efficiency in terms of additional cost reduction. So I would expect to continue to see evolving, improving business in the upstream just as I expect to see that in our Chemical and Downstream business."

Can you just discuss if there was thought in increasing the dividend this quarter? What needs to happen to increase the dividend moving forward? And maybe connect that to debt levels? And connected to that, would you consider some sort of shareholder distribution strategy that gives cash to shareholders as oil prices are kind of above any long-term trend you expect? 
And then my second question is on Chemicals. It seems like the segment kind of has a lack of transparency with 2 respects. One in the performance product earnings and two, on benefits to greenhouse gas emissions. So on the performance products, can you discuss what that's contributing currently if there was kind of an outsized benefit because of the overall chemicals environment strength? And what kind of a normalized earnings looks like moving forward in that performance products? 
And then related to emissions, you mentioned that the performance products really help with emissions reductions, but Exxon maybe doesn't get that benefit because it's not like a Scope 3 reduction or your own emissions reductions. Is there any thought to supporting kind of emissions reporting scheme that awards Exxon for producing products that helps the world reduce emissions even if it doesn't reduce your own emissions? That's it. Sorry, I know that was a lot, but I appreciate it."

And I'm going to -- I will let Jack talk to the Chemical piece of your question, and I'll address the capital allocation. What I will, though, just on the Chemical ones.

That is something that we talk a lot about. We've -- gas is another one I would add with respect to the alternatives that are out there today. So it is an important part of the equation that we think about and continue to work. And I'm less focused on how you take credit for it and more focused on making sure that it happens. But I'll let Jack spend some more time on that. 
With respect to your capital allocation and the dividends, I would tell you that the foundational elements of our capital allocation remain unchanged with respect to making sure that we're finding high-return, industry-advantaged investments because that underpins basically everything else we do for the long term. We're a capital-intensive industry. And so you better be making sure that you've got a good program of investments of capital, particularly in the depletion side of the business. Maintaining the balance sheet has always been an important part. We drew down heavily, and that advantaged paid off last year, and we're going to rebuild that. So as you said, that's part of our strategy. And then shareholders distributions have been the third leg of that stool, an important aspect. 
And so with respect to that, of course, you heard, we think we've got a good plan on our investments and the range that we'll be investing going forward. We're making good progress on the debt, particularly given the higher price environments than anticipated. And then on distribution, it is part of the conversation and the discussions we've had. I would tell you, we have always felt a very strong commitment to our base shareholders to deliver on a dividend, a reliable and growing dividend, and that continues to be part of the conversation. And I would say the Board would like to continue to deliver on that commitment. And so we continue -- we're committed to that, a reliable dividend and one that grows with time. 
And obviously, if we're maintaining capital in the range that we want, we get our debt back to levels that assure us the ability to ride through the cycles, and we've got a manageable dividend that's reliable and growing. Recognize any time you raise the dividend, that brings the burden up. We're going to continue to do that. But at the same time, they want to manage that, that total outlay in the dividend. And so buybacks and other distributions become part of that equation, particularly when to redistribute cash. So that's all on the table. And I think as we move through this year and depending on where prices at, those opportunities will grow in relevance. And with a capital program that's pretty well defined and a debt that -- objective that's pretty well defined, you've got this opportunity on distributions, I think the Board will continue to evaluate as we go forward."

And I think that was demonstrated if you look at this quarter, a lot of -- almost all the Chemical companies benefited from the dynamics we had in the quarter. But you saw the earnings power of our chemicals company because of this higher margin, because of the technology we bring in those performance products. 
And the other advantage those have -- when you think about all our investments going forward, these investments are focused on generating those performance products, and they're not more capital intensive. This is catalyst technology. So it's not more capital intensive and yet we get -- we're having -- we're generating a product that gets 10% to 25% more margin. So you can imagine those investments look more profitable as well.

It's good to be with you today to discuss our strong third quarter results and the progress we are making in growing shareholder value and, of course, to take your questions. 
I'd like to start by welcoming Kathy to the call, her first in what I know will be many. I can tell you that Kathy has hit the ground running, seamlessly joined the management team and has been broadly welcomed by the organization. While early in her tenure, we are already benefiting from her diverse experiences and wise counsel. 
Since we posted a full set of slides and remarks on the website, I'll keep my comments brief this morning, starting with an overview of the work we are doing to position the company to sustainably grow shareholder value. 
Our first priority was to significantly grow the value of our base business to achieve industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth. This is work that has been ongoing for some time and is built on the significant changes we have made to our organization and increased focus on fully leveraging all of our competitive advantages in technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and most importantly, our people. This also allowed us to improve operating performance, drive down costs and develop a portfolio of industry-advantaged high-return investments. Our businesses are driving returns and generating cash to maintain a strong balance sheet and fund future investments. The work we began in 2018 to develop opportunities in carbon capture and later low-emission fuels plays to our competitive strengths, positions us to build a successful low carbon solutions business, and take a leading role in driving to a lower carbon future in hard-to-decarbonize areas. At the same time, we have to ensure our plans are robust to a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways, and the continuing use of hydrocarbons. Our low-carbon solutions business draws on the same core capabilities and competitive strengths used in our established businesses. This gives us optionality and build resiliency into our plans. As the future takes shape and demand shift across our businesses, we will maintain our advantage. 
Now I'll turn to our third quarter performance. The value of the organization's hard work I just highlighted is showing itself as the market recovers. In the third quarter, we delivered excellent operational and financial performance with improved earnings and cash flow. We significantly improved our cash position, reduced total debt, progressed key projects and set a number of best-ever operational milestones. 
Earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion. Year-to-date, earnings surpassed $14 billion on the strength of our upstream portfolio and industry-leading chemical and downstream businesses. 
Last year during the pandemic, we worked to improve our cost structure by $3 billion versus 2019. That progress continued in the third quarter. Our structural costs are now $4.5 billion lower than 2019 on an annual basis, with a clear line of sight to continued improvements. 
Strong earnings and sound CapEx management resulted in cash flow after CapEx and dividends of $5.2 billion. We paid down approximately $4 billion of debt during the quarter and increased the dividend, maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth. 
Good progress in improving the earnings power of our business, coupled with solid operating performance in a rapidly improving market, provides a good foundation for developing our future plans We will finalize our plans over the course of November, and we will provide additional details in early December. However, I'd like to take the opportunity of this call to provide a brief overview of some key planned priorities and objectives, starting with our operations. 
In 2020, we delivered industry-leading performance in safety and reliability. Our go-forward plans intend to sustain that leadership position. We also established objectives to significantly reduce emissions intensity by 2025. 
Our focus on this effort more than paid off. We now expect to meet our objectives this year and are working to significantly raise the bar and reset our 2025 objectives. 
We are also ahead of schedule in our work to improve our cost structure. We expect to deliver more than $6 billion in structural savings by 2023. 
We continue to find additional synergies and greater efficiency throughout our new organization. We expect to keep our capital spend within the previously communicated range of $20 billion to $25 billion. This represents a significant reduction versus our pre-pandemic plans. 
With the changes we've made to our businesses, our new project organization and improved use of technology, we expect to deliver the same growth in earnings and cash flow as our pre-pandemic plans, offsetting the pandemic-induced delays. In addition, we can free up funds to grow our low-carbon solutions business and further accelerate efforts to reduce emissions. From 2022 to 2027, our cumulative capital investment in emission reduction projects is expected to be $15 billion. 
This year, we made substantial progress in restoring the strength of our balance sheet. By year-end, we expect to be well within the debt-to-capital range of 20% to 25%. 
On Wednesday, we announced an increase in our dividend, adding to what is already a very attractive yield. In addition, given the improvements in our business and market conditions, we are expanding shareholder distributions by up to $10 billion over 12 to 24 months through a repurchase program beginning next year. 
Our plans are being built from the bottoms up, with strong line ownership and a commitment to deliver. They are flexible and can be adjusted to adverse market conditions. They strike a strong balance across our capital allocation priorities, drive continued efficiencies and significantly grow earnings and cash flow while competitively positioning us for a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways.

Darren, I want to kick off just with a comment, and commend your restraint against the ludicrous question you were faced with the [indiscernible]. I'm not sure all of us could have stood up to the same level of patience for that testimony. 
And that leads me to my first question, which is your -- you've got a new Board, or at least a refreshed Board. And you've now come out with this updated low carbon, I guess, investment strategy going forward. I'm just curious when the new Board members have got to look under the hood at the relative investment opportunities, you have the carbon intensity of those, the returns that cash, free cash, margin expansion opportunities and so on. I'm just curious how perceptions of the new Board members relative to what external perceptions might be, how those have evolved as you've had the chance to present your strategy to those folks?"

I think let me just start with maybe a little broader comment on the Board and the discussions we've been having. Which I would tell you, we've got additional diversity of perspective in the Board. It's bringing a very engaged board",489,"Yes. Thank you, Doug. I think let me just start with maybe a little broader comment on the Board and the discussions we've been having. Which I would tell you, we've got additional diversity of perspective in the Board. It's bringing a very engaged board across the entire group and a lot of good constructive discussions. 
And to your point, I think as folks come into the company and look under the hood and get an understanding of how we approach and look at these businesses, the opportunities that we have and how our advantages manifest themselves in those opportunities. I think there's generally I would describe it as sound solid consensus across the board in terms of the recognition of the strength of the portfolio that we have, and a recognition of the industry-leading position that our investment and our projects have. 
I would also say and as you know, you mentioned low-carbon investments. We launched that business earlier this year. But if you'll recall from our Investor Day, I talked about that in the context of ventures that we established starting back in 2018, looking at carbon capture opportunities and then a little later on, the low emission fuels opportunities. And what we're focused on there was how do we find these investment opportunities to help drive lower emissions going forward, but do that in a way that's accretive to the shareholders and one that distinguishes us from the rest of the industry. And so it's really looking for a formula that leverages our existing competitive advantages. 
And what we tried to share in the Investor Day last year, and we'll continue to talk about and spend more time talking about in the Investor Day next year, is we think we have found a really good mix of opportunities that are very well aligned with our core capabilities, and therefore as we move forward, can invest in both our established businesses. Given some of the policy that exists around the world, there are opportunities to invest in low-carbon solutions business and still generate a very solid return from that, and then as we move in the growth, manifest itself across that portfolio. Because we're drawing on those same capabilities, we have the ability to shift resources with between those and make sure that we're responding to the developments in the marketplace. 
That strategy, that discussion that we've been having with the Board, I think, is recognized as a unique capability that this company has. Our global footprint gives us exposure to a very broad set of markets. And as those markets develop somewhat uniquely with respect to the transition, we can adjust our approach in those markets selectively to make sure that we're on the front end of that and taking advantage of the opportunities as they develop. So I think there's a strong recognition of the advantages that we bring to this space as a whole."

And in particular a number of areas that we don't have complete solutions yet, and the need for companies like ExxonMobil to help develop those. And so we, as you know, resisted what we think are some of the more, let me call it commodity opportunities in this space, and focus on where we don't have good solutions and where we can leverage a unique capability, and therefore generate what we think will be a unique returns. 
That portfolio that we're talking about today, we're leveraging some proprietary technologies to boost the returns there. And so our approach here is not going to be what I would call an industry standard. It's going to be advantaged projects, like we've tried to generate in the rest of the portfolio. 
I think as you think about that $15 billion, part of it is around our growth projects and making sure that we are building resiliency into those growth projects, by putting in the necessary investments in technology to lower the greenhouse gases, so those projects become that much more robust. And the returns that we're showing for those projects comprehend that spend to lower the emissions. And then we've got new opportunities that we're pursuing, that take advantage of some of the policy that's out there and generate returns. And then we're building and seeding what I would say the development of a much larger scale projects that are going to require additional policy. And we're doing the work in anticipation of that, recognizing that as that policy front develops, we'll be in a position to take advantage of that with projects that we've developed in anticipation of it."

And I would start with first of all, we've got to invest in the advantaged projects that we have, that earn very strong returns. And that's from Guyana to things like biofuels and the  Strathcona  project, right? 
Obviously, we've been very focused on maintaining a strong dividend. I think the company did a great job, as it went through the pandemic, really protecting that dividend. And that's a priority for us. 
And we've got to have a strong balance sheet, and you've seen our focus over the course of this year in strengthening the balance sheet. In this quarter, we reduced debt by about $4 billion. 
After we consider those priorities, if we've got available cash, we will then look to distribute that to shareholders. And you've obviously seen that in the buyback announcement that we had. 
I think it's important also to just recognize that the company looks to have a balanced approach and maintain flexibility. You would have seen the company reduce its capital spending pretty significantly, in part to protect the dividend as the pandemic was ensuing. And so we do have flexibility as we think about capital allocation, but those are our priorities. Obviously, share repurchase programs are an efficient way to distribute capital to shareholders, but that's how we think about it."

So maybe just following up on Doug's question by asking it in a little different way. Can you just talk about how the new Board is weighing evidence that increased oil and gas investment is probably warranted, not just from Exxon but globally, against what's becoming essentially a mandate from investors to allocate capital to the energy transition? And how does that seemingly dual mandate kind of square with the current medium-term CapEx range? We know you reiterated it, but we understand that the low-carbon solution and the emission reductions that will now have a larger share. And that kind of CapEx spend is extending beyond the medium-term range."

And then if Kathy's got anything to add, I'll pass it on to her. 
But I think you talked about a dual mandate. And that's really the challenge that we face as a company, and I think more broadly as a society, which is clearly a drive to move to a lower emissions energy system and a lower emissions future, but at the same time recognizing that the need for energy today is real and continuing to grow. And I think striking that balance and thoughtfully moving forward and trying to make sure that as you're transitioning from one source to another, that you do it in a way that doesn't penalize populations and compromise people's standards of living. 
You see a little maybe evidence of the challenge there when you look at what's happening in Europe and some of the constraints as we've come out of the pandemic, with the depletion business and the lack of investment that the industry broadly had in 2019 going into -- severely into 2020, and still coming out of that in 2021. And then the growing the growth in demand, you put those 2 together, lack of demand, lower supply, growing lack of -- yes, lower supply and lower investments and then the growth in demand, you get these pinch points. 
And so I think the Board and management were very conscientious of that and recognize our challenge is to leverage our perspective, the experience that we have in this space, our understanding of it, and to try to strike the appropriate balance and make sure we're moving forward at a pace. And in fact leading industry as we drive to this lower emissions future, but not leave whole communities behind and penalize them with respect to their standards of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. And the investments that we're making, I think strike that balance. 
And I've been very pleased that the work that we started back in 2018 and 2019 and through 2020. Difficult to see during the pandemic with the collapse in the demand, but I think today as we come out of that and you see the market recovery, the benefits of those structural changes that we have made are manifesting themselves. We are able to generate the same kind of value with a lot less capital and a lot less expense. And that's been because of the work we've done with our organization and the emphasis on leveraging our competitive advantages. And foremost among those people and the work that they've done through this time frame and the technology that we brought to bear in some of this work. 
If you look at the capital portfolio that we had coming into the pandemic, none of the projects -- we haven't dropped any of the projects. We're still moving those forward. As you know, we paused them. If you look at the spend associated with those projects, we've actually managed to bring that spend down. And I think that's a testament to our new projects organization. So a lot of good work manifesting itself in the results that you're seeing and in the future that we're laying out, the ability to do what we said we were going to do more efficiently, and then expand into the lower carbon area where we're finding with the work that we've done, opportunities in that space as well."

And then of course, our ability to execute those opportunities and high-grade the asset portfolio will be a function of, obviously, finding buyers who put a value on that that's consistent with what we think we need in order to take that out of the portfolio. 
So that's work going on. I would tell you we did a lot of work last year, maintaining our push in this space, but not willing to really push anything out to a market where we didn't see the value that we expected.

I would say your breakeven calculations are significantly higher than what ours are. And of course, one of the issues is we haven't had the opportunity to take you through the plans in development and the reviews that we're having with our Board. So that's I think to come. But the work that we've been doing and what I've referenced here so far on the call with respect to the OpEx reductions that we are seeing, and the opportunity frankly that we see going forward, and the capital productivity that we are now demonstrating. And I'd put that really in 2 buckets. 
One is the project organization, which I continually refer back to. But to me, it's been such a huge success to leverage what were very strong organizations across the corporation, centralizing that, bringing it together and making sure that we're putting the best resources on the projects that best fits the need their capabilities is really resulting in some significant capital efficiency improvements. 
And the other thing, the other bucket would be technology. We laid out a plan, and I'll just focus on the Permian for now. But we laid out a plan there to pre-invest, to do a lot of delineation to understand what we had there. We were working on bringing in some technology, doing quite a bit of trialing and testing, which again requires some upfront capital. We put in a -- if you recall what I call the long ball game, which is leveraging ExxonMobil's strengths into a Permian, and moved from what was considered a short game in the Permian to a long ball. And that's paying off, and we're seeing that work that we're doing out in the Permian deliver the same value for a lot less spend. And that's a function of that organization and the work that they've been doing to really drive their efficiencies, but also to fully leverage the capability of the broader Exxon Mobil Corporation and our technology portfolio. 
So that's how I'd say we're going to be able to do everything we've talked about. And frankly depending on how the market is, as you know, it's really hard to call the market. And we've built some plans with some pretty wide ranges and were robust to some very low price environments going forward, that won't compromise the capital allocation balance that we've talked about. And if we find the market is higher than that low side, we'll have additional cash and resources to work on. And I'll give that challenge to Kathy, but maybe let her talk about that for a minute."

I would tell you, I don't think we're immune to the pressures that are impacting just about every other business out there all around the world. And so we're certainly seeing some aspects of that in our business. 
If I start with the big spend area with respect to our capital and projects, I think somewhat maybe counterintuitively, the fact that we were working on those going into the pandemic, when we went into the pandemic, I think we took somewhat of a longsighted approach with respect to we didn't just step out of those projects. Instead, we worked with our partners and contractors to think about how we put these projects on pause, and then bring them back up in a thoughtful way as and when the market would enable that. And so the work that we did last year and working with our partners allowed us to give them some certainty around work and opportunities going forward, and we're able to lock in some of market factors at that point in time. 
So in the capital space, I think we've done a pretty good job. And we'll be pretty well positioned to offset a lot of those and not experience a lot of those inflationary pressures. 
In the base business, I mean certainly, the higher price of energy is impacting our manufacturing. We're advantaged in that space generally because most of our facilities are more energy efficient than our competitors. And so while that's raising cost across the board with that advantage, we're able to kind of stay below where the rest is. And of course, market prices move in these commodity markets based on the marginal cost of the suppliers for the last barrel of supply. So that's we're able to I think that's being offset with the margins. 
And then I'd say more generally, what's left with respect to supply chain and inflationary pressures, with the organizations that we have in place and then up and running now and then in a much richer environment with higher margins and more activity, they're able to take the efficiencies and the synergies that we've captured with the new organization different approaches that we're now taking, and apply that in a more let me call it a target-rich environment. So we're able to find those efficiencies and offset a lot of the inflation. 
So think different aspects happening in different parts of the business, but generally that inflationary pressure, we're managing to basically cope with it and still deliver on the earnings growth that we set for ourselves, the target set for ourselves."

Well as you know, we have this contiguous acreage that we recognized would be advantaged with respect to trying to develop what would be, I'll call it a more manufacturing approach in the Permian. So you'll recall we made some upfront investments around, one, delineating that acreage to make sure we knew what we had. Because I think as Neil has talked in the past about, not all of that acreage is the same. The reservoirs are different as you move around that the area out there. And so making sure that we were thinking -- focusing on the areas where we have productivity, but at the same time, making sure the area that we approach, that we optimize everything in the subsurface and weren't going for just high initial rates but instead looking at maximum recovery. 
And that's paid off. We invested in the corridors. We invested in the infrastructure to make sure that we are in a position to ones we focused in on, and identified the areas we wanted to develop, that we could do that in a very cost-efficient way. And that is now paying off. As you look at what we're doing in the Permian, it is much more of a manufacturing mindset and very focused on efficiencies. And you're seeing that in the results and some of the metrics that are out there. 
And then the third area is, and it continues to I think yield benefits, is thinking about how we bring our fundamental science and technology capabilities from the broader organization, from our corporate research group, and bring that into play here in the Permian and in the unconventional space. And that is paying off as well. We've gotten I think some very positive results from some of our technologies that we've brought into the field. We're continuing to trial new technology. So my expectation is we'll continue to see that manifest itself in better production and better capital efficiency. And those would be the 3 pieces of the equation that I think are resulting in the performance that you're seeing.
With respect to the overall activity, what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what I just talked about and not -- as we kind of maximize what we can do within that space, making sure we don't get ahead of the technology work that we're doing, making sure we don't get outside those corridors in some of those optimized areas of production. And that's the balance and the debate that we're striking. We may see a couple of more rigs come on here as we go forward and staying within that same philosophy. I wouldn't see us starting to venture out into other areas that are outside that optimized space and plan, until we've done the work to optimize plans around that next tier of opportunities out there."

And I recognize that we're in front of the Board process and things are still being hammered out. But I think the way that the market is conceptualizing the range is that the spend for the underlying asset base today, including the growth projects, is probably tighter than the range that you've communicated. And the top end of the range is sort of like a rainy day fund for special opportunities that arise, either in the low-carbon sphere or otherwise. 
Do you think that's a fair assessment as we kind of think about 2022? And I think it flows into an earlier point about breakeven as well. How do we think about the outflow on CapEx within the range, which obviously influences that commodity price breakeven assessment?"

And we think we're going to come in I'd say at the lower end of that $16 billion to $19 billion range we've provided.

What underpins that is further investment in Guyana focused on [indiscernible], Yellowtail appraisals .[ Baku ] in Brazil is now moving into the start-up of drilling, and so more significant spending heading into there. 
We obviously paused a number of downstream and chemical projects. Those are restarting. And so we'll start to see that spend in the fourth quarter and tick up pretty significantly in 2022. And I'd also mention that as we look to accelerate our reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and intensity specifically, we'll be spending a bit more in that area.
So if you think about how that is going to cause us to kick up, I'd say that clearly will put us in that $20 billion to $25 billion range. And then clearly, we would leave ourselves some level of flexibility in that range for things that we can't fully anticipate as we sit here today."

So maybe just spend a little bit of time talking about the philosophy that we've taken with respect to developing the low-carbon business. 
And again, I would start with foundationally the work that we're doing has to leverage some advantage. We want to make sure that the investments that we're making here, we bring some unique value to and expect that unique value to manifest itself in value for our shareholders. And so that's the foundation. 
And I mentioned this carbon capture venture that we started back in 2018 in low emission fuels. And it was how do we take advantage of the portfolio of technologies that we have and the skills and capabilities of our people, to find ways to do this that are different and better than the rest of the industry. So that's the foundation. 
Then as a philosophy, making sure that we develop a portfolio that is accretive with existing policy. So not betting on the [ come, ] not thinking that something is going to pop here and then developing projects that ultimately disappoint us. And so that -- and given that we've got a really I think broad footprint, we're able to tap into different policies around the world. And there are a number of governments, since we launched low-carbon solutions, that have reached out to us and want to work with us to understand how we and what we can bring to the equation to help advance some of their objectives. And so those discussions are happening, but I would say there's a fundamental layer of investment that is accretive with existing policy. Don't look, don't need more help. 
Then there's the other tier where these certainly would not be regret investments, but we would need to see some additional policy to make those -- to kind of give us the returns that we would expect, given the resources we're bringing to bear with for those projects. And those are another -- we need to develop those now. Because if we wait until the policy's in place, we'll be behind the game. And so we're being very thoughtful around developing those projects. 
It also informs what we're going to need and so that we can very clearly articulate to policymakers all around the world, what would required. And it starts us down what I would call that learning curve to better inform policymakers and then position us to respond to the policy as and when it comes. Because I think one thing is very clear: in order for society to achieve this longer-term ambition, we're going to need different policies, additional policies around the world. We want to be help lead the industry and the drive to lower emissions and then to take advantage and influence some of those policies."

So the comment that we're making with respect to doubling the earnings and cash flow potential of the business, we try to normalize for price environment. So we're not going to take any help from the market or assume help from the market, but instead assume constant price basis and make sure that the work that we're doing are structural improvements. And so that if the market is there and consistent, then we'll double it. If it's higher, we'll do even more than that. And if it's lower, we'll still be in a very robust position. 
And so that's kind of how we think about it. And this year's -- certainly this quarter's margins are not consistent with the basis that we're using for longer term. We are getting some advantage from the market today. We don't assume that is something that manifests itself through the plan. And so that's I think an important foundation to evaluate the comments that we're making. 
We talked about the structural efficiency. That's obviously a huge part. And as I said, when we get through the plan, get that endorsed and when we come out and start speaking and take you through the Investor Day, we'll spend more time explaining where some of those savings are coming from. That will be a really important contributing factor. 
And then with respect to the projects and the businesses, I think as you look across each of those, the projects are delivering what we expected, in fact in many cases, delivering more than we had anticipated for the things that we started off. I'll give you just a couple of examples. 
If you look at investments that we've already made in the Gulf Coast and our chemical plants, those are running well above the AR basis. Reliability and throughput is much higher than we expected. So that's delivering more value. 
If you look at the Rotterdam hydrocracker out in Europe, that was a ""new to the world"" technology, upgrading very low-value streams into high-value lubricant products. That is performing very, very well and delivering well above the basis. 
And so -- and if you look at our chemicals business and the high-performance products, a lot of the growth and value that we see in that business comes from continuing to penetrate the market with these differentiated high-value products. And the chemical organization is doing a great job at continuing to grow that and to demonstrate the value of those technical benefits to our customers that they in turn can realize some benefit from those products. 
So those are all working very well. And finally in the downstream, a lot of work to make sure that we are driving efficiencies into that business and then squeezing, upgrading every molecule we can into the higher-value segments. The projects that we've talked about in that space are doing just that, just high-grading the molecules and getting more value. And when you combine that with reduced cost, the refining business is better positioned. 
And of course, the lubricants business, again a differentiated high-value technology-driven product. They are really doing very, very well growing their business. And this year we're seeing record earnings in there. 
So if you look across one of the advantages of having such a diverse portfolio is it gives us a lot of strength and levers to pull, to grow value. And so you see that in all of them. 
And then of course, the final point I would make is, and I've been making throughout this call, is we're able to deliver those a lot of those projects and those benefits at a much lower cost and a lot less capital. And so that's playing into the benefits that we've laid out in the deck."

Then of course, with that comes the recovery in energy demand. I would say that it is kind of stops and starts, so to speak, as you move around the world, with some of variance that we're seeing with COVID kind of slow things down and then pick back up again. But generally as you look around the world, seeing a recovery. 
If you look across what I would say primary transportation fuels, I' say, road transport, commercial transport, heavy-duty transport, those are getting back to where they were historically. And so I would say the recovery, you can clearly see that recovery's in place. 
The thing that's lagging, which I'm sure we all recognize given our own personal circumstances, is air travel is lagging that recovery. It is improving, continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We saw an improvement this quarter. And so I think ultimately, when you see that demand balance recover, and when I say demand balance, I mean across a barrel of crude as it moves into the transportation markets, it's going to require air travel get back to where it was. 
And then it will just be a function about how strong that economic growth is that drives the activity and in the demand. And that, of course, be balanced with the amount of capacity that's available to meet that demand. So as always supply and demand balance will be the primary factor. 
There's been a lot of refinery closures, so -- a lot higher rate than there has been. These high energy prices through gas and LNG is going to put some additional pressure on some of advantaged refinery. 
So I think we've got to see how that plays out. But our view is this -- the downstream business, when it has a peak or goes through a tight supply/demand balance, it doesn't last very long. So we're really gearing that business up to be successful in a very low-margin environment. And we're leveraging and focusing our efforts on refineries that are integrated with, our chemicals business integrated with our lubricants business, so that we aren't dependent and reliant upon just the fuels market, but instead have a much more diversified product slate that taps into some of the higher-value products."

So a, I would start with by taking a step back and saying we expect double-digit returns across all of our business, and we don't look at this business really any differently. If I look specifically at the capital that I'd say is targeted towards the low-carbon solutions business, so different from the emissions reductions that we're making across our own portfolio, either our existing business or the growth projects and looking to offset those incremental emissions that would come with growth projects, what I'd say is we look at that and say we think we can see really strong double-digit returns coming from there. Now we have a lot of biofuel projects that are embedded there which are supported by policy. 
The  Strathcona  project up in Canada would be a great example of that. Clearly, we are seeding some investments. Darren referenced the Houston hub project where we have to feed those investments today. 
Carbon capture does need fuller policy support. We referenced that kind of earlier in the discussion today. But if we don't start to seed the planning for those investments, we'll be behind when the policy support comes. And it's clear if we're going to make more progress towards a lower-carbon future, more policy support does have to come. 
So that is how we're thinking about it. And we see great opportunities in the space that we're targeting where we think the company really brings advantage.

Do you see there's room for change or adjustment? Or that you think the current process is pretty good, and you don't really have any changes that need to be made? So that's the first question. 
For the second question  for Darren now. ] when we're looking at your CapEx has always been, for at least that for the past 18 months, at $20 billion, $25 billion for the next several years. So you maintained that, but your spending for the low carbon is going to be increased by call it roughly $2 billion a year; from previously maybe $500 million, $600 million, to say $2.5 billion now. 
So is the incremental spending is all being absorbed, because you're doing better in other business and be able to squeeze all the saving out? Or that some legacy project has been pushed out? If they are, what are those? And what does the low-carbon business that you're targeting I think at 10%-plus return, is it going to be better than the project that you pushed out? 
And what we noted is [indiscernible] is noticeable missing in your press release when you're talking about the strategic investment. Can you give an update on that?"

And I guess the first thing that I would say is I've been really pleased with how the organization has actually welcomed me. You can imagine coming into a company like ExxonMobil, I would say I was a little bit anxious about what the receptivity would be. And both at the management committee, I'd say across the senior leadership team and across the company, people have just been really welcoming, which has been terrific.
The other thing I would say is as I look at many of the company's processes, I'm really pleased by how rigorous and thorough they are. ExxonMobil puts a lot of work behind things before it comes out and then makes decisions and talks about those things. 
And so you mentioned our FID process, which I think is incredibly rigorous. And the company added sometime back a process that they call red blue team, which is literally putting really smart people and kind of competing them against each other to say, ""Hey, as we're going to FID this project, tell us what a different perspective is on whether the project could be even better than what our base economics are. And tell us what a different perspective might be in terms of what some of the call it hidden risks might be in the project, and have we evaluated all of that."" And that's a process where I'd say we take all of those learnings. And then the base economics, how we're managing the risks of the projects just get improved to an even greater level. So I'd say I've been really pleased just by the thorough work that's done across the company. 
And I'd take that even into a different area we haven't talked about it on a call. But obviously net zero is the topic of the day, and the company is clearly doing a lot of work in terms of its own scenario analysis. We talked a lot about the announcement we made in increasing our investment in the low-carbon emission space. And again, all I would comment on is that the rigor of the work that you see at the company is incredible. The work that we're doing on a site-by-site location-by-location basis and staring at our kind of cost curves and the plans and how we're going to reduce our own carbon footprint, I just think is incredibly thorough in detail. And it's what enables us to really stand strongly behind our plan. So anyway, I've been really pleased, really happy with just how the organization has accepted me as an outsider."

And I'm not sure that anybody on the management committee thinks of her any different than the rest of us. So it's been I think a really nice fit. And she brings in a different perspective, which is very valued, and it's added to the discussions and the debates that we've been having and we're going to continue to have.
With respect to the questions that you've asked me, I didn't quite catch the last one. But I'll address your first around the incremental spending and how given we haven't changed the range, but it feels a little bit like the portfolio mix is changing, how do we -- where does that come from? How do we think about that? And so what I would tell you is probably 3 components of how with our evolving plans and the work that we're doing, in particular the additional spend in low-carbon solutions, how we're doing that within the same band of the range of capital that we've projected or given all of you. There savings is clearly one of them. And I've mentioned that quite a bit throughout the call, so I won't go back around that again. But that has made a difference to the ability. 
If you remember, what we said we wanted to do is double earnings and double cash flow. And that's been the objective. It hasn't been a volumes game. It hasn't been a capital spend game. It's around how do you do that and do it most effectively. And as we found ways to do it more effectively, that's allowed us to take off some of the capital spending. So that's an important component of it. 
There are -- there have been some shifting, as there always is in this space, and so if you think about some of the LNG projects, there's been some movement on that. Mozambique and the work that we've been doing there and the collaboration with Total with some of the issues that we've seen in Mozambique, that has slipped some, but we're still committed to that project. We see that as a valuable opportunity, but we're going to have to do that in the time frame available to us with some of the constraints that we see today. So there is movement in some of those projects. 
Obviously, we delayed the downstream mechanical projects. Those are coming back up again, but that shifted the pattern a little bit. So there's some of that in there. 
And then the third bucket I would say is we always left ourselves some, and that headroom is -- continues in there. So we've got flexibility. We never -- I mean there's always -- I think the question out there about where we hit 20 where we hit 25, I'd say we're somewhere around there, and it moves from year to year. We give ourselves a little bit of space, recognizing that things are going to move around, very difficult to predict some of the scheduling movement around there. So that's how I would think about it in those 3 buckets. 
And frankly, the way we judge that is ultimately, does that movement inhibit our ability to deliver on the value proposition that we laid out? And that is one of the points that why we really want to emphasize that we are going to deliver on the earnings and cash flow growth. Which is what we have been driving the organization to do, because we believe ultimately, that underpins the growing TSR, total shareholder return. So -- And the last point, Kathy, you have..."

It's good to be with you today to discuss our strong third quarter results and the progress we are making in growing shareholder value and, of course, to take your questions. 
I'd like to start by welcoming Kathy to the call, her first in what I know will be many. I can tell you that Kathy has hit the ground running, seamlessly joined the management team and has been broadly welcomed by the organization. While early in her tenure, we are already benefiting from her diverse experiences and wise counsel. 
Since we posted a full set of slides and remarks on the website, I'll keep my comments brief this morning, starting with an overview of the work we are doing to position the company to sustainably grow shareholder value. 
Our first priority was to significantly grow the value of our base business to achieve industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth. This is work that has been ongoing for some time and is built on the significant changes we have made to our organization and increased focus on fully leveraging all of our competitive advantages in technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and most importantly, our people. This also allowed us to improve operating performance, drive down costs and develop a portfolio of industry-advantaged high-return investments. Our businesses are driving returns and generating cash to maintain a strong balance sheet and fund future investments. The work we began in 2018 to develop opportunities in carbon capture and later low-emission fuels plays to our competitive strengths, positions us to build a successful low carbon solutions business, and take a leading role in driving to a lower carbon future in hard-to-decarbonize areas. At the same time, we have to ensure our plans are robust to a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways, and the continuing use of hydrocarbons. Our low-carbon solutions business draws on the same core capabilities and competitive strengths used in our established businesses. This gives us optionality and build resiliency into our plans. As the future takes shape and demand shift across our businesses, we will maintain our advantage. 
Now I'll turn to our third quarter performance. The value of the organization's hard work I just highlighted is showing itself as the market recovers. In the third quarter, we delivered excellent operational and financial performance with improved earnings and cash flow. We significantly improved our cash position, reduced total debt, progressed key projects and set a number of best-ever operational milestones. 
Earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion. Year-to-date, earnings surpassed $14 billion on the strength of our upstream portfolio and industry-leading chemical and downstream businesses. 
Last year during the pandemic, we worked to improve our cost structure by $3 billion versus 2019. That progress continued in the third quarter. Our structural costs are now $4.5 billion lower than 2019 on an annual basis, with a clear line of sight to continued improvements. 
Strong earnings and sound CapEx management resulted in cash flow after CapEx and dividends of $5.2 billion. We paid down approximately $4 billion of debt during the quarter and increased the dividend, maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth. 
Good progress in improving the earnings power of our business, coupled with solid operating performance in a rapidly improving market, provides a good foundation for developing our future plans We will finalize our plans over the course of November, and we will provide additional details in early December. However, I'd like to take the opportunity of this call to provide a brief overview of some key planned priorities and objectives, starting with our operations. 
In 2020, we delivered industry-leading performance in safety and reliability. Our go-forward plans intend to sustain that leadership position. We also established objectives to significantly reduce emissions intensity by 2025. 
Our focus on this effort more than paid off. We now expect to meet our objectives this year and are working to significantly raise the bar and reset our 2025 objectives. 
We are also ahead of schedule in our work to improve our cost structure. We expect to deliver more than $6 billion in structural savings by 2023. 
We continue to find additional synergies and greater efficiency throughout our new organization. We expect to keep our capital spend within the previously communicated range of $20 billion to $25 billion. This represents a significant reduction versus our pre-pandemic plans. 
With the changes we've made to our businesses, our new project organization and improved use of technology, we expect to deliver the same growth in earnings and cash flow as our pre-pandemic plans, offsetting the pandemic-induced delays. In addition, we can free up funds to grow our low-carbon solutions business and further accelerate efforts to reduce emissions. From 2022 to 2027, our cumulative capital investment in emission reduction projects is expected to be $15 billion. 
This year, we made substantial progress in restoring the strength of our balance sheet. By year-end, we expect to be well within the debt-to-capital range of 20% to 25%. 
On Wednesday, we announced an increase in our dividend, adding to what is already a very attractive yield. In addition, given the improvements in our business and market conditions, we are expanding shareholder distributions by up to $10 billion over 12 to 24 months through a repurchase program beginning next year. 
Our plans are being built from the bottoms up, with strong line ownership and a commitment to deliver. They are flexible and can be adjusted to adverse market conditions. They strike a strong balance across our capital allocation priorities, drive continued efficiencies and significantly grow earnings and cash flow while competitively positioning us for a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways. We look forward to sharing more details with you later this year and into the first quarter of next year.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Stephen."

And that leads me to my first question, which is your -- you've got a new Board, or at least a refreshed Board. And you've now come out with this updated low carbon, I guess, investment strategy going forward. I'm just curious when the new Board members have got to look under the hood at the relative investment opportunities, you have the carbon intensity of those, the returns that cash, free cash, margin expansion opportunities and so on. I'm just curious how perceptions of the new Board members relative to what external perceptions might be, how those have evolved as you've had the chance to present your strategy to those folks?"

Which I would tell you, we've got additional diversity of perspective in the Board. It's bringing a very engaged board across the entire group and a lot of good constructive discussions. 
And to your point, I think as folks come into the company and look under the hood and get an understanding of how we approach and look at these businesses, the opportunities that we have and how our advantages manifest themselves in those opportunities. I think there's generally I would describe it as sound solid consensus across the board in terms of the recognition of the strength of the portfolio that we have, and a recognition of the industry-leading position that our investment and our projects have. 
I would also say and as you know, you mentioned low-carbon investments. We launched that business earlier this year. But if you'll recall from our Investor Day, I talked about that in the context of ventures that we established starting back in 2018, looking at carbon capture opportunities and then a little later on, the low emission fuels opportunities. And what we're focused on there was how do we find these investment opportunities to help drive lower emissions going forward, but do that in a way that's accretive to the shareholders and one that distinguishes us from the rest of the industry. And so it's really looking for a formula that leverages our existing competitive advantages. 
And what we tried to share in the Investor Day last year, and we'll continue to talk about and spend more time talking about in the Investor Day next year, is we think we have found a really good mix of opportunities that are very well aligned with our core capabilities, and therefore as we move forward, can invest in both our established businesses. Given some of the policy that exists around the world, there are opportunities to invest in low-carbon solutions business and still generate a very solid return from that, and then as we move in the growth, manifest itself across that portfolio. Because we're drawing on those same capabilities, we have the ability to shift resources with between those and make sure that we're responding to the developments in the marketplace. 
That strategy, that discussion that we've been having with the Board, I think, is recognized as a unique capability that this company has. Our global footprint gives us exposure to a very broad set of markets. And as those markets develop somewhat uniquely with respect to the transition, we can adjust our approach in those markets selectively to make sure that we're on the front end of that and taking advantage of the opportunities as they develop. So I think there's a strong recognition of the advantages that we bring to this space as a whole."

And in particular a number of areas that we don't have complete solutions yet, and the need for companies like ExxonMobil to help develop those. And so we, as you know, resisted what we think are some of the more, let me call it commodity opportunities in this space, and focus on where we don't have good solutions and where we can leverage a unique capability, and therefore generate what we think will be a unique returns. 
That portfolio that we're talking about today, we're leveraging some proprietary technologies to boost the returns there. And so our approach here is not going to be what I would call an industry standard. It's going to be advantaged projects, like we've tried to generate in the rest of the portfolio. 
I think as you think about that $15 billion, part of it is around our growth projects and making sure that we are building resiliency into those growth projects, by putting in the necessary investments in technology to lower the greenhouse gases, so those projects become that much more robust. And the returns that we're showing for those projects comprehend that spend to lower the emissions. And then we've got new opportunities that we're pursuing, that take advantage of some of the policy that's out there and generate returns. And then we're building and seeding what I would say the development of a much larger scale projects that are going to require additional policy. And we're doing the work in anticipation of that, recognizing that as that policy front develops, we'll be in a position to take advantage of that with projects that we've developed in anticipation of it."

And I would start with first of all, we've got to invest in the advantaged projects that we have, that earn very strong returns. And that's from Guyana to things like biofuels and the  Strathcona  project, right? 
Obviously, we've been very focused on maintaining a strong dividend. I think the company did a great job, as it went through the pandemic, really protecting that dividend. And that's a priority for us. 
And we've got to have a strong balance sheet, and you've seen our focus over the course of this year in strengthening the balance sheet. In this quarter, we reduced debt by about $4 billion. 
After we consider those priorities, if we've got available cash, we will then look to distribute that to shareholders. And you've obviously seen that in the buyback announcement that we had. 
I think it's important also to just recognize that the company looks to have a balanced approach and maintain flexibility. You would have seen the company reduce its capital spending pretty significantly, in part to protect the dividend as the pandemic was ensuing. And so we do have flexibility as we think about capital allocation, but those are our priorities. Obviously, share repurchase programs are an efficient way to distribute capital to shareholders, but that's how we think about it."

So maybe just following up on Doug's question by asking it in a little different way. Can you just talk about how the new Board is weighing evidence that increased oil and gas investment is probably warranted, not just from Exxon but globally, against what's becoming essentially a mandate from investors to allocate capital to the energy transition? And how does that seemingly dual mandate kind of square with the current medium-term CapEx range? We know you reiterated it, but we understand that the low-carbon solution and the emission reductions that will now have a larger share. And that kind of CapEx spend is extending beyond the medium-term range."

And then if Kathy's got anything to add, I'll pass it on to her. But I think you talked about a dual mandate. And that's really the challenge that we face as a company, and I think more broadly as a society, which is clear",575,"Yes, I'll start off with that. And then if Kathy's got anything to add, I'll pass it on to her. 
But I think you talked about a dual mandate. And that's really the challenge that we face as a company, and I think more broadly as a society, which is clearly a drive to move to a lower emissions energy system and a lower emissions future, but at the same time recognizing that the need for energy today is real and continuing to grow. And I think striking that balance and thoughtfully moving forward and trying to make sure that as you're transitioning from one source to another, that you do it in a way that doesn't penalize populations and compromise people's standards of living. 
You see a little maybe evidence of the challenge there when you look at what's happening in Europe and some of the constraints as we've come out of the pandemic, with the depletion business and the lack of investment that the industry broadly had in 2019 going into -- severely into 2020, and still coming out of that in 2021. And then the growing the growth in demand, you put those 2 together, lack of demand, lower supply, growing lack of -- yes, lower supply and lower investments and then the growth in demand, you get these pinch points. 
And so I think the Board and management were very conscientious of that and recognize our challenge is to leverage our perspective, the experience that we have in this space, our understanding of it, and to try to strike the appropriate balance and make sure we're moving forward at a pace. And in fact leading industry as we drive to this lower emissions future, but not leave whole communities behind and penalize them with respect to their standards of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. And the investments that we're making, I think strike that balance. 
And I've been very pleased that the work that we started back in 2018 and 2019 and through 2020. Difficult to see during the pandemic with the collapse in the demand, but I think today as we come out of that and you see the market recovery, the benefits of those structural changes that we have made are manifesting themselves. We are able to generate the same kind of value with a lot less capital and a lot less expense. And that's been because of the work we've done with our organization and the emphasis on leveraging our competitive advantages. And foremost among those people and the work that they've done through this time frame and the technology that we brought to bear in some of this work. 
If you look at the capital portfolio that we had coming into the pandemic, none of the projects -- we haven't dropped any of the projects. We're still moving those forward. As you know, we paused them. If you look at the spend associated with those projects, we've actually managed to bring that spend down. And I think that's a testament to our new projects organization. So a lot of good work manifesting itself in the results that you're seeing and in the future that we're laying out, the ability to do what we said we were going to do more efficiently, and then expand into the lower carbon area where we're finding with the work that we've done, opportunities in that space as well."

In fact, what I would say is as we continue to evaluate where we can better leverage our competitive strengths and high-grade that portfolio. I think you'd see the opportunity set that underpins that divestment portfolio grow. And then of course, our ability to execute those opportunities and high-grade the asset portfolio will be a function of, obviously, finding buyers who put a value on that that's consistent with what we think we need in order to take that out of the portfolio. 
So that's work going on. I would tell you we did a lot of work last year, maintaining our push in this space, but not willing to really push anything out to a market where we didn't see the value that we expected.

I would say your breakeven calculations are significantly higher than what ours are. And of course, one of the issues is we haven't had the opportunity to take you through the plans in development and the reviews that we're having with our Board. So that's I think to come. But the work that we've been doing and what I've referenced here so far on the call with respect to the OpEx reductions that we are seeing, and the opportunity frankly that we see going forward, and the capital productivity that we are now demonstrating. And I'd put that really in 2 buckets. 
One is the project organization, which I continually refer back to. But to me, it's been such a huge success to leverage what were very strong organizations across the corporation, centralizing that, bringing it together and making sure that we're putting the best resources on the projects that best fits the need their capabilities is really resulting in some significant capital efficiency improvements. 
And the other thing, the other bucket would be technology. We laid out a plan, and I'll just focus on the Permian for now. But we laid out a plan there to pre-invest, to do a lot of delineation to understand what we had there. We were working on bringing in some technology, doing quite a bit of trialing and testing, which again requires some upfront capital. We put in a -- if you recall what I call the long ball game, which is leveraging Exxon Mobil's strengths into a Permian, and moved from what was considered a short game in the Permian to a long ball. And that's paying off, and we're seeing that work that we're doing out in the Permian deliver the same value for a lot less spend. And that's a function of that organization and the work that they've been doing to really drive their efficiencies, but also to fully leverage the capability of the broader Exxon Mobil Corporation and our technology portfolio. 
So that's how I'd say we're going to be able to do everything we've talked about. And frankly depending on how the market is, as you know, it's really hard to call the market. And we've built some plans with some pretty wide ranges and were robust to some very low price environments going forward, that won't compromise the capital allocation balance that we've talked about. And if we find the market is higher than that low side, we'll have additional cash and resources to work on. And I'll give that challenge to Kathy, but maybe let her talk about that for a minute."

I would tell you, I don't think we're immune to the pressures that are impacting just about every other business out there all around the world. And so we're certainly seeing some aspects of that in our business. 
If I start with the big spend area with respect to our capital and projects, I think somewhat maybe counterintuitively, the fact that we were working on those going into the pandemic, when we went into the pandemic, I think we took somewhat of a longsighted approach with respect to we didn't just step out of those projects. Instead, we worked with our partners and contractors to think about how we put these projects on pause, and then bring them back up in a thoughtful way as and when the market would enable that. And so the work that we did last year and working with our partners allowed us to give them some certainty around work and opportunities going forward, and we're able to lock in some of market factors at that point in time. 
So in the capital space, I think we've done a pretty good job. And we'll be pretty well positioned to offset a lot of those and not experience a lot of those inflationary pressures. 
In the base business, I mean certainly, the higher price of energy is impacting our manufacturing. We're advantaged in that space generally because most of our facilities are more energy efficient than our competitors. And so while that's raising cost across the board with that advantage, we're able to kind of stay below where the rest is. And of course, market prices move in these commodity markets based on the marginal cost of the suppliers for the last barrel of supply. So that's we're able to I think that's being offset with the margins. 
And then I'd say more generally, what's left with respect to supply chain and inflationary pressures, with the organizations that we have in place and then up and running now and then in a much richer environment with higher margins and more activity, they're able to take the efficiencies and the synergies that we've captured with the new organization different approaches that we're now taking, and apply that in a more let me call it a target-rich environment. So we're able to find those efficiencies and offset a lot of the inflation. 
So think different aspects happening in different parts of the business, but generally that inflationary pressure, we're managing to basically cope with it and still deliver on the earnings growth that we set for ourselves, the target set for ourselves."

Well as you know, we have this contiguous acreage that we recognized would be advantaged with respect to trying to develop what would be, I'll call it a more manufacturing approach in the Permian. So you'll recall we made some upfront investments around, one, delineating that acreage to make sure we knew what we had. Because I think as Neil has talked in the past about, not all of that acreage is the same. The reservoirs are different as you move around that the area out there. And so making sure that we were thinking -- focusing on the areas where we have productivity, but at the same time, making sure the area that we approach, that we optimize everything in the subsurface and weren't going for just high initial rates but instead looking at maximum recovery. 
And that's paid off. We invested in the corridors. We invested in the infrastructure to make sure that we are in a position to ones we focused in on, and identified the areas we wanted to develop, that we could do that in a very cost-efficient way. And that is now paying off. As you look at what we're doing in the Permian, it is much more of a manufacturing mindset and very focused on efficiencies. And you're seeing that in the results and some of the metrics that are out there. 
And then the third area is, and it continues to I think yield benefits, is thinking about how we bring our fundamental science and technology capabilities from the broader organization, from our corporate research group, and bring that into play here in the Permian and in the unconventional space. And that is paying off as well. We've gotten I think some very positive results from some of our technologies that we've brought into the field. We're continuing to trial new technology. So my expectation is we'll continue to see that manifest itself in better production and better capital efficiency. And those would be the 3 pieces of the equation that I think are resulting in the performance that you're seeing.
With respect to the overall activity, what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what I just talked about and not -- as we kind of maximize what we can do within that space, making sure we don't get ahead of the technology work that we're doing, making sure we don't get outside those corridors in some of those optimized areas of production. And that's the balance and the debate that we're striking. We may see a couple of more rigs come on here as we go forward and staying within that same philosophy. I wouldn't see us starting to venture out into other areas that are outside that optimized space and plan, until we've done the work to optimize plans around that next tier of opportunities out there."

But I think the way that the market is conceptualizing the range is that the spend for the underlying asset base today, including the growth projects, is probably tighter than the range that you've communicated. And the top end of the range is sort of like a rainy day fund for special opportunities that arise, either in the low-carbon sphere or otherwise. 
Do you think that's a fair assessment as we kind of think about 2022? And I think it flows into an earlier point about breakeven as well. How do we think about the outflow on CapEx within the range, which obviously influences that commodity price breakeven assessment?"

And we think we're going to come in I'd say at the lower end of that $16 billion to $19 billion range we've provided.

What underpins that is further investment in Guyana, focused on Payara, Yellowtail appraisal, [indiscernible ] in Brazil is now moving into the start-up of drilling, and so more significant spending heading into there. 
We obviously paused a number of downstream and chemical projects. Those are restarting. And so we'll start to see that spend in the fourth quarter and tick up pretty significantly in 2022. And I'd also mention that as we look to accelerate our reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and intensity specifically, we'll be spending a bit more in that area.
So if you think about how that is going to cause us to kick up, I'd say that clearly will put us in that $20 billion to $25 billion range. And then clearly, we would leave ourselves some level of flexibility in that range for things that we can't fully anticipate as we sit here today."

So maybe just spend a little bit of time talking about the philosophy that we've taken with respect to developing the low-carbon business. 
And again, I would start with foundationally the work that we're doing has to leverage some advantage. We want to make sure that the investments that we're making here, we bring some unique value to and expect that unique value to manifest itself in value for our shareholders. And so that's the foundation. 
And I mentioned this carbon capture venture that we started back in 2018 in low emission fuels. And it was how do we take advantage of the portfolio of technologies that we have and the skills and capabilities of our people, to find ways to do this that are different and better than the rest of the industry. So that's the foundation. 
Then as a philosophy, making sure that we develop a portfolio that is accretive with existing policy. So not betting on the [ come, ] not thinking that something is going to pop here and then developing projects that ultimately disappoint us. And so that -- and given that we've got a really I think broad footprint, we're able to tap into different policies around the world. And there are a number of governments, since we launched low-carbon solutions, that have reached out to us and want to work with us to understand how we and what we can bring to the equation to help advance some of their objectives. And so those discussions are happening, but I would say there's a fundamental layer of investment that is accretive with existing policy. Don't look, don't need more help. 
Then there's the other tier where these certainly would not be regret investments, but we would need to see some additional policy to make those -- to kind of give us the returns that we would expect, given the resources we're bringing to bear with for those projects. And those are another -- we need to develop those now. Because if we wait until the policy's in place, we'll be behind the game. And so we're being very thoughtful around developing those projects. 
It also informs what we're going to need and so that we can very clearly articulate to policymakers all around the world, what would required. And it starts us down what I would call that learning curve to better inform policymakers and then position us to respond to the policy as and when it comes. Because I think one thing is very clear: in order for society to achieve this longer-term ambition, we're going to need different policies, additional policies around the world. We want to be help lead the industry and the drive to lower emissions and then to take advantage and influence some of those policies."

So the comment that we're making with respect to doubling the earnings and cash flow potential of the business, we try to normalize for price environment. So we're not going to take any help from the market or assume help from the market, but instead assume constant price basis and make sure that the work that we're doing are structural improvements. And so that if the market is there and consistent, then we'll double it. If it's higher, we'll do even more than that. And if it's lower, we'll still be in a very robust position. 
And so that's kind of how we think about it. And this year's -- certainly this quarter's margins are not consistent with the basis that we're using for longer term. We are getting some advantage from the market today. We don't assume that is something that manifests itself through the plan. And so that's I think an important foundation to evaluate the comments that we're making. 
We talked about the structural efficiency. That's obviously a huge part. And as I said, when we get through the plan, get that endorsed and when we come out and start speaking and take you through the Investor Day, we'll spend more time explaining where some of those savings are coming from. That will be a really important contributing factor. 
And then with respect to the projects and the businesses, I think as you look across each of those, the projects are delivering what we expected, in fact in many cases, delivering more than we had anticipated for the things that we started off. I'll give you just a couple of examples. 
If you look at investments that we've already made in the Gulf Coast and our chemical plants, those are running well above the AR basis. Reliability and throughput is much higher than we expected. So that's delivering more value. 
If you look at the Rotterdam hydrocracker out in Europe, that was a ""new to the world"" technology, upgrading very low-value streams into high-value lubricant products. That is performing very, very well and delivering well above the basis. 
And so -- and if you look at our chemicals business and the high-performance products, a lot of the growth and value that we see in that business comes from continuing to penetrate the market with these differentiated high-value products. And the chemical organization is doing a great job at continuing to grow that and to demonstrate the value of those technical benefits to our customers that they in turn can realize some benefit from those products. 
So those are all working very well. And finally in the downstream, a lot of work to make sure that we are driving efficiencies into that business and then squeezing, upgrading every molecule we can into the higher-value segments. The projects that we've talked about in that space are doing just that, just high-grading the molecules and getting more value. And when you combine that with reduced cost, the refining business is better positioned. 
And of course, the lubricants business, again a differentiated high-value technology-driven product. They are really doing very, very well growing their business. And this year we're seeing record earnings in there. 
So if you look across one of the advantages of having such a diverse portfolio is it gives us a lot of strength and levers to pull, to grow value. And so you see that in all of them. 
And then of course, the final point I would make is, and I've been making throughout this call, is we're able to deliver those a lot of those projects and those benefits at a much lower cost and a lot less capital. And so that's playing into the benefits that we've laid out in the deck."

Then of course, with that comes the recovery in energy demand. I would say that it is kind of stops and starts, so to speak, as you move around the world, with some of variance that we're seeing with COVID kind of slow things down and then pick back up again. But generally as you look around the world, seeing a recovery. 
If you look across what I would say primary transportation fuels, I' say, road transport, commercial transport, heavy-duty transport, those are getting back to where they were historically. And so I would say the recovery, you can clearly see that recovery's in place. 
The thing that's lagging, which I'm sure we all recognize given our own personal circumstances, is air travel is lagging that recovery. It is improving, continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We saw an improvement this quarter. And so I think ultimately, when you see that demand balance recover, and when I say demand balance, I mean across a barrel of crude as it moves into the transportation markets, it's going to require air travel get back to where it was. 
And then it will just be a function about how strong that economic growth is that drives the activity and in the demand. And that, of course, be balanced with the amount of capacity that's available to meet that demand. So as always supply and demand balance will be the primary factor. 
There's been a lot of refinery closures, so -- a lot higher rate than there has been. These high energy prices through gas and LNG is going to put some additional pressure on some of advantaged refinery. 
So I think we've got to see how that plays out. But our view is this -- the downstream business, when it has a peak or goes through a tight supply/demand balance, it doesn't last very long. So we're really gearing that business up to be successful in a very low-margin environment. And we're leveraging and focusing our efforts on refineries that are integrated with, our chemicals business integrated with our lubricants business, so that we aren't dependent and reliant upon just the fuels market, but instead have a much more diversified product slate that taps into some of the higher-value products."

So a, I would start with by taking a step back and saying we expect double-digit returns across all of our business, and we don't look at this business really any differently. If I look specifically at the capital that I'd say is targeted towards the low-carbon solutions business, so different from the emissions reductions that we're making across our own portfolio, either our existing business or the growth projects and looking to offset those incremental emissions that would come with growth projects, what I'd say is we look at that and say we think we can see really strong double-digit returns coming from there. Now we have a lot of biofuel projects that are embedded there which are supported by policy. 
The  Strathcona  project up in Canada would be a great example of that. Clearly, we are seeding some investments. Darren referenced the Houston hub project where we have to feed those investments today. 
Carbon capture does need fuller policy support. We referenced that kind of earlier in the discussion today. But if we don't start to seed the planning for those investments, we'll be behind when the policy support comes. And it's clear if we're going to make more progress towards a lower-carbon future, more policy support does have to come. 
So that is how we're thinking about it. And we see great opportunities in the space that we're targeting where we think the company really brings advantage. So carbon capture, hydrogen, biofuels is our current focus. And we think we're going to be able to prosecute those projects and earn good returns."

And obviously, we've got some work that we're doing in carbon capture. 
So in all those areas, it's just coming back to and the challenge we've given the organization, the standard we're holding ourselves to, is we've got to find a way to do this, meet this demand, this need of a lower-carbon lower emissions future, but doing it in a way that's advantaged and therefore brings value to shareholders.

You are the first person from outside who joined the company management committee. And also that quite frankly for the past say 30 years, Exxon didn't have an official CFO role. 
So after you joined, after you've been there for several months, how do you think about the process in the project FID and M&A as well as the criterion? Do you see there's room for change or adjustment? Or that you think the current process is pretty good, and you don't really have any changes that need to be made? So that's the first question. 
For the second question  for Darren now. ] when we're looking at your CapEx has always been, for at least that for the past 18 months, at $20 billion, $25 billion for the next several years. So you maintained that, but your spending for the low carbon is going to be increased by call it roughly $2 billion a year; from previously maybe $500 million, $600 million, to say $2.5 billion now. 
So is the incremental spending is all being absorbed, because you're doing better in other business and be able to squeeze all the saving out? Or that some legacy project has been pushed out? If they are, what are those? And what does the low-carbon business that you're targeting I think at 10%-plus return, is it going to be better than the project that you pushed out? 
And what we noted is [indiscernible] is noticeable missing in your press release when you're talking about the strategic investment. Can you give an update on that?"

And I guess the first thing that I would say is I've been really pleased with how the organization has actually welcomed me. You can imagine coming into a company like ExxonMobil, I would say I was a little bit anxious about what the receptivity would be. And both at the management committee, I'd say across the senior leadership team and across the company, people have just been really welcoming, which has been terrific.
The other thing I would say is as I look at many of the company's processes, I'm really pleased by how rigorous and thorough they are. ExxonMobil puts a lot of work behind things before it comes out and then makes decisions and talks about those things. 
And so you mentioned our FID process, which I think is incredibly rigorous. And the company added sometime back a process that they call red blue team, which is literally putting really smart people and kind of competing them against each other to say, ""Hey, as we're going to FID this project, tell us what a different perspective is on whether the project could be even better than what our base economics are. And tell us what a different perspective might be in terms of what some of the call it hidden risks might be in the project, and have we evaluated all of that."" And that's a process where I'd say we take all of those learnings. And then the base economics, how we're managing the risks of the projects just get improved to an even greater level. So I'd say I've been really pleased just by the thorough work that's done across the company. 
And I'd take that even into a different area we haven't talked about it on a call. But obviously net zero is the topic of the day, and the company is clearly doing a lot of work in terms of its own scenario analysis. We talked a lot about the announcement we made in increasing our investment in the low-carbon emission space. And again, all I would comment on is that the rigor of the work that you see at the company is incredible. The work that we're doing on a site-by-site location-by-location basis and staring at our kind of cost curves and the plans and how we're going to reduce our own carbon footprint, I just think is incredibly thorough in detail. And it's what enables us to really stand strongly behind our plan. So anyway, I've been really pleased, really happy with just how the organization has accepted me as an outsider."

And I'm not sure that anybody on the management committee thinks of her any different than the rest of us. So it's been I think a really nice fit. And she brings in a different perspective, which is very valued, and it's added to the discussions and the debates that we've been having and we're going to continue to have.
With respect to the questions that you've asked me, I didn't quite catch the last one. But I'll address your first around the incremental spending and how given we haven't changed the range, but it feels a little bit like the portfolio mix is changing, how do we -- where does that come from? How do we think about that? And so what I would tell you is probably 3 components of how with our evolving plans and the work that we're doing, in particular the additional spend in low-carbon solutions, how we're doing that within the same band of the range of capital that we've projected or given all of you. There savings is clearly one of them. And I've mentioned that quite a bit throughout the call, so I won't go back around that again. But that has made a difference to the ability. 
If you remember, what we said we wanted to do is double earnings and double cash flow. And that's been the objective. It hasn't been a volumes game. It hasn't been a capital spend game. It's around how do you do that and do it most effectively. And as we found ways to do it more effectively, that's allowed us to take off some of the capital spending. So that's an important component of it. 
There are -- there have been some shifting, as there always is in this space, and so if you think about some of the LNG projects, there's been some movement on that. Mozambique and the work that we've been doing there and the collaboration with Total with some of the issues that we've seen in Mozambique, that has slipped some, but we're still committed to that project. We see that as a valuable opportunity, but we're going to have to do that in the time frame available to us with some of the constraints that we see today. So there is movement in some of those projects. 
Obviously, we delayed the downstream mechanical projects. Those are coming back up again, but that shifted the pattern a little bit. So there's some of that in there. 
And then the third bucket I would say is we always left ourselves some, and that headroom is -- continues in there. So we've got flexibility. We never -- I mean there's always -- I think the question out there about where we hit 20 where we hit 25, I'd say we're somewhere around there, and it moves from year to year. We give ourselves a little bit of space, recognizing that things are going to move around, very difficult to predict some of the scheduling movement around there. So that's how I would think about it in those 3 buckets. 
And frankly, the way we judge that is ultimately, does that movement inhibit our ability to deliver on the value proposition that we laid out? And that is one of the points that why we really want to emphasize that we are going to deliver on the earnings and cash flow growth. Which is what we have been driving the organization to do, because we believe ultimately, that underpins the growing TSR, total shareholder return. So -- And the last point, Kathy, you have..."
