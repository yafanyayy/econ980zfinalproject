Our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter, and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. Recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 17%",569,"Thanks, Brian. Our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter, and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. Recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 17% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel. 
Our revenue mix and cost efficiencies contributed to 120 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.9%. Cash flow has been very robust throughout the year. And both cash from operations and free cash flow ended the year strong and grew 16.5% and 25.8%, respectively. This was our highest fourth quarter and full year cash flow ever. And for the year, free cash flow grew 53.6% to $326.6 million. 
Bookings for the quarter were relatively flat with the prior year at approximately $333 million. Our largest deal of the quarter, which was also the largest single contract in our history, was a 5-year extension of our e-filing arrangement with the Texas Office of court administration valued at approximately $98 million. The extension also included e-filing insights of Socrata-based interactive reporting layer that eliminates hundreds of hours of manual reporting activities and gets clerks in all 254 counties the ability to monitor 50,000 daily filings so they can identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies and improve the experience for the public. However, due to certain contract provisions, only a very small portion of the value of this contract was included in backlog and bookings. If the entire value of this contract have been included in backlogs, bookings growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 28%. 
Our largest new SaaS deal in the fourth quarter was with Jackson County, Missouri for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution as well as appraisal services, valued at approximately $18 million. Other significant contracts signed this quarter included a multi suite license arrangement for our Munis ERP, EnerGov civic services and Socrata data insight solutions with the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, valued at approximately $5 million. 
SaaS agreements with the city of Jacksonville, Florida for our EnerGov civic services solution and was Stark County, Ohio for our public safety solution, each valued at approximately $4 million. And 10 SaaS deals and 3 license contracts for various Tyler solutions, each valued at over $1 million. 
Brian will discuss our guidance for 2021, but I'd like to update you on some of our plans arounding our strategic initiatives to accelerate our move to the cloud. Our 2021 plan includes accelerated and new cloud investments across the spectrum of our products. Our plan includes approximately $23 million of investments in cloud product development in 2021 and a total investment of more than $52 million over the next 3 years, with the majority of that expense. As a result of these investments, we expect by the end of 2023, all of our major applications will either be cloud-native or cloud efficient for deployment at AWS. 
We've also made some organizational changes, some of which were announced earlier this week, to focus additional leadership on our cloud initiatives as well as streamlining internal technology and security operations and driving other technology efficiency objectives. 
Now I'd like for Brian to provide detail on the results for the quarter."

This morning, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, under the financial reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
Our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $283.3 million, down 1.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $283.4 million, down 1.4%. Software license revenues declined 46%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a very high mix of subscription deals at 73%. Software services revenues declined to 18% as some projects slowed as a result of COVID-19. In our shift to remote delivery of most services also resulted in a $5 million decline in billable travel revenue. 
On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 17%. We added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 50 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. 
In Q4 of last year, we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $74 million in contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 54% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.5 years compared to 4.4 years last year. 
Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $24.6 million, up 13.3%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.5 million, up 5.1% and e-payments revenue of $9.1 million, up 30.6%. 
For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $850 million, up 10.4%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q4 was approximately $278 million, up 17.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $98 million, up 13.3%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $474 million, up 5.8%. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.59 billion, up 9.4%. 
As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were relatively flat at $333 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, down 1.3%, and against a tough comparison that included the 2 large North Carolina Courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. If the full amount of the Texas e-filing extension had been included in our backlog, Q4 bookings would have grown 28%, and trailing 12-month bookings would have grown 5.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $11 million in new annual recurring revenue. The bookings growth rate was also affected by the shorter average term for new subscription contract. As it was throughout the year, cash flow was robust in the fourth quarter as cash from operations increased 16.5% to $88.8 million, and free cash flow grew 25.8% to $83.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. 
Our earnings release has the full details of our 2021 guidance, which excludes the impact of NIC and any other acquisitions which may be completed during the year. We expect to update our guidance to include the NIC transaction after it closes. 
With regard to revenue and earnings, we expect 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP revenues will both be between $1.19 billion and $1.22 billion, representing a range of growth from 6.6% to 9.3%. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.03 and $4.21 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive [ rewards ] on our GAAP effective tax rate. 
We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.65 and $5.77, representing an increase of 2.4% to 4.5%. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42.5 million and 43 million shares. 
As we look ahead to 2021, it's clear that we won't be back to normal for some time. We've said on prior calls that we anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 would continue into 2021, and our plan for this year anticipates this ongoing uncertainty. Nonetheless, we're excited about our opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and achieve our margin objectives for this year. Revenue growth, while below our normal targets, is expected to be significantly above the 2020 level. 
Just to refresh your memory, as we entered 2020, our guidance was for non-GAAP revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% and for margins to be relatively flat with 2019 with an expectation of resuming our margin expansion trajectory in 2021. COVID-19 obviously resulted in the 2020 performance that was very different from our initial guidance as we finished with low single-digit revenue growth and 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We've talked before about how some of the factors that led to margin improvement in 2020 are sustainable, while others are not. Those factors include a favorable change in our revenue mix from a decline in low-margin revenues, like professional services and billable travel, as well as cost savings in areas like travel, marketing and employee health care. 
I'd like to point out a few of the factors that are expected to impact our margins this year. Employee health care expense will have a significant impact on operating margins in 2021. During 2020, we saw an unexpected decline in our health care costs as the pandemic curtailed elective surgeries, checkups and much of our employees' nonurgent health care. And our net health claims expense per employee declined to 8.4% for the year. 
As those costs return to normal pre-pandemic levels in 2021, coupled with inflation, we are expecting an increase of approximately $13 million or 21% over the reduced level in 2020. Also our diluted share count is expected to be 575,000 to 1.1 million shares higher than in 2020. We issued approximately 1.3 million shares under our stock compensation plans in 2020, including 1.2 million shares from the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. Our higher stock price also impacts the dilution calculation. 
If our diluted share count in 2021 was the same as 2020, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would be about $0.18 higher. As a reminder, beginning in 2018, we began a shift in our long-term incentive equity to a mix of options, restricted stock units and performance stock units. As that shift continues, we anticipate a significantly less dilutive impact of long-term stock incentives going forward. Our guidance implies operating margins that are modestly below the 2020 level but above our 2019 operating margins. That trend is generally in line with the trajectory we targeted at the beginning of 2020. And if we achieve our plan, we'll finish 2021 with margins in line with or above what we would have expected pre pandemic. 
So to conclude, our 2021 plan reflects a solid combination of organic revenue growth and strategic growth investments, especially around our cloud transition. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

As I look back on 2020, I'm marveled and how our team of professionals performed in the extraordinary environment over the last few months. We were laser-focused on continuing to take care of our clients' needs as we always do, while taking care of each other at the same time. And while our financial results certainly weren't what we expected at the start of the year, we adapted to the new realities of the pandemic with very good results. 
As I've said numerous times during the last year, I couldn't be prouder to lead our incredible company and his people. While 2020 presented a myriad of challenges, we view many of those challenges as creating opportunities that Tyler is well positioned to take advantage of. Our financial position is stronger than it was a year ago with more than $800 million in cash and investments and no debt on our balance sheet today. 
We've been able to continue to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, and they are all on track. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. 
Our client base is large and diverse with more than 27,000 implementations, and it represents our greatest asset for both future sales opportunities and the dependable revenue stream it produces. And we have a deep and experienced management team that has weathered difficult economic times in the past. All of these factors make us confident that we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize as markets return to normal. 
So with that, I'd like to turn to this morning's extremely exciting announcement that Tyler has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NIC Inc in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion. We're going to spend a bit of time today walking you through why NIC is the exceptional addition to the Tyler family, and we'll leave time at the end of the presentation for your questions. 
But before we begin, I'll remind you that we have posted a presentation on the acquisition on our IR website, and I'll refer to some of those slides in my remarks. I would draw your attention to the disclosures on Slide 3 related to solicitation materials. And remind you that additional information is available on the websites of both Tyler and NIC. 
So with that out of way, I'd like to start by highlighting the significant benefits of this acquisition, the largest in Tyler's history by a wide margin brings to our business. NIC is a leading digital solutions provider to state and federal government entities and will meaningfully increase Tyler's presence in both of those sectors, building on the entry points we achieved via our acquisitions of Micropact and Socrata a couple of years ago. NIC also brings to Tyler a very large incremental payments processing business for governments, allowing us to meaningfully grow a revenue stream that is highly recurring in nature. NIC's unique statewide contract structure and complementary portfolio of offerings will allow Tyler to better serve a broader customer base with a more complete set of solutions. Perhaps most importantly, Tyler and NIC are 2 companies whose cultures are complementary and well aligned, which I will touch on more in a moment. 
In terms of the transaction specifics, this is an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $34 per share, which equates to an equity value of $2.3 billion or an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion inclusive of NIC balance sheet cash. We have committed financing to fund the transaction in the form of cash on hand and a $1.6 billion bridge facility, which we anticipate replacing with permanent capital between signing and closing. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both boards of directors and is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the NIC shareholders. 
We expect this combination to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in the first year. It's important to note that we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet post transaction, with a very reasonable balance of leverage and liquidity. 
I'd like to briefly touch again on the point around culture and how that played into the rationale for this acquisition. NIC is a company that's been on Tyler's radar screen for quite some time, and we have admired their reputation in the marketplace from a distance. As I and the rest of the Tyler management team got to know our counterparts at NIC over the last few weeks and months, it became increasingly clear how similar our 2 organizations are, as you can see from the similarities in our respective missions. Tyler and NIC are 2 companies built on integrity and focused on delivering differentiated value for all of our respective constituents: governments, businesses, citizens, employees and shareholders. 
I view this combination as a continued realization of our mission of empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer and stronger communities. 
The pandemic has accelerated the shift by governments to online services and electronic payments as more citizens and businesses are interacting digitally with government. NIC is uniquely positioned with its deep expertise and robust digital solutions to partner with us in making government more efficient and more accessible to citizens. NIC's capabilities and vision align with and are complementary to our connected communities vision and will advance our efforts to bring that to our clients. On Slide 6, we've included a bit more information on NIC as well as some key relevant statistics. The company is a leading digital solutions and payments provider, serving more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC has enterprise-wide partnerships with 31 states, and a robust payments business that currently processes $24 billion in payments annually, and that amount will increase significantly with the implementation of the payments processing contract NIC recently signed with the state of Florida. 
The company's broad set of solutions and a unique go-to-market contracting model allow NIC to become deeply embedded with their clients, resulting in predictable, highly recurring revenue growth. For the fiscal year ended 2020, NIC delivered revenue of more than $460.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of about $108.8 million. NIC's complete fourth quarter earnings were also released this morning, and you will find their complete results on their website. 
On Slide 7, you can see the breadth of NIC's leading portfolio of digital government solutions. At a high level, the company is focused on delivering user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. NIC serves both businesses and citizens with solutions to tackle information, interactions and payments for a wide range of government agencies and importantly, including a variety of delivery methods such as Gov2GO go, NIC's unique proprietary, cross agency mobile platform designed specifically for citizens to interact with government. 
We drilled down a bit further into NIC's focus areas on Slide 8, and importantly, how NIC solutions map to our existing portfolio. As we assess NIC's fit with Tyler, we thought about their portfolio of offerings through [indiscernible] lenses. Certain of NIC's end markets, such as their solutions for businesses, courts are highly complementary with Tylers. NIC's presence in these sectors at the state and federal level are naturally aligned with Tyler's established presence at the local level. Other areas, such as outdoor recreation and [ taxes ], represent natural adjacencies to expand Tyler's current business, while a sector like motor vehicles is a clear growth opportunity. 
The key takeaway from our assessment of NIC's portfolio is that there are a number of areas where Tyler's existing businesses will benefit from NIC quickly and where avenues of growth should open up organically for both of us over time, a similar fact pattern emerges, if you look at NIC's geographic footprint, which is shown on Slide 9. NIC has established relationships across the nation, including geographic alignment with Tyler in several complementary solution areas, with 16 states where both companies have active contracts at different agencies. NIC State Enterprise and Platform Solutions businesses, both of which we'll touch on in greater detail in a moment, already have great breadth in depth, and we see a number of white space opportunities to expand these platforms as part of the Tyler portfolio. We also view NIC's federal client relationships as a natural fit to simply expand our existing Tyler federal business. 
On Slide 10, we provide a more detailed overview of NIC's state enterprise business, including a look at the long-term relationships the company has built over time. NIC's State Enterprise solution offers a unique approach to working with governments by putting dedicated local teams in capital cities for support and developing services and solutions that are relevant to all agencies within the state government. NIC is able to deploy best practices gleaned over a number of decades and leverage a deep foundation of technological capabilities in tailoring solutions to fit specialized needs. The company's flexible statewide contract vehicles allow governments to avoid cumbersome procurement processes by authorizing NIC to develop and implement a wide range of solutions across a number of different agencies. These long-term contracts lead to clear line of sight, both operationally and from a revenue perspective, as evidenced by NIC's historic ability to grow same-state revenue at 8% plus. NIC's Platform Solutions business, which is illustrated on Slide 11, includes comprehensive agency specific vertical solutions that are the product of significant investments NIC has made in recent years, both organically and inorganically and represent scalable solutions designed to address specific areas of market demand. 
On the payment side, NIC has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed for governments that can be integrated into state enterprise systems or offered stand-alone. Recently acquired solutions and licensing and health care are already showing early wins with new contracts award across 5 states, while NIC has successfully deployed various outdoor recreation solutions in 12 states. The early momentum in this piece of NIC's business is clearly evident and is very exciting for Tyler. We see significant opportunity to drive outside growth with these platform technologies. 
Turning to Slide 12. I would like to reiterate how strongly we believe in the merits of this transaction and view the addition of NIC as a combination of complementary strengths. With this acquisition, we will create a public sector technology solutions leader that furthers our goal of connecting governments with constituents and businesses in a way that is seamless and transparent. 
I'd close by noting how delighted we are to soon welcome NIC and their employees to the Tyler family. I remind you that we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approval by NIC stockholders. As a result, we are somewhat limited in our ability to discuss certain aspects of the transaction at this time. 
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

On your first question around budgets and activity level, as we've said going in -- we said at the last quarterly call, our anticipation was that COVID would continue into 2021. As you recall, most of our clients, their budget seasons are June 30. And so they're in the midst of those budgets. When you look back at 2020 and some of the comments I made during the year, the pandemic actually was impacting different parts of our business a little bit differently. We saw a little more impact in our ERP space, particularly at the mid and higher end and a little bit more in the appraisal and tax space. We actually had a really good sales year last year at Courts and Justice. When we talk about that a little bit later, it's actually a record sales year for them. But that number of RFPs and demos and all that slowdown what really impacted certain parts of our business more. And it's just anecdotal right now. We're now just 1 month into 2021. But in -- what we've seen a little bit, particularly on the ERP side, we don't only don't talk about awards and wins, but the awards in January and the contract values. Was something that's certainly up over the last 8 months and is a positive sign. We see things over in like in the appraisal and tax area where there are some fairly significant projects, some fairly large RFPs that really got put on the shelf in Q2 of last year. We're starting to see those starting to come out again. That doesn't necessarily mean immediate contracts, as you know, or immediate deals, but we are seeing some of that. 
There's still going to be headwinds in 2021. Obviously, with the COVID relief that just passed, there's some uncertainty about what that's going to mean. We're still seeing pushes and delays. But I think at your comment about defrosting I'm kind of getting an early sense, but again, it's anecdotal right now. I think we'll know a lot more, obviously, at the end of Q1. And as the vaccine rolls out and people start getting more comfortable, I think we'll start getting better clear sight on that. 
On the NIC front, I just want to say a couple of things. I've mentioned in the opening remarks a couple of times now about stockholder approval and regulatory approval. There are certain things I can say right now and certain things I can't. I'm going to air right now on the conservative side. Because this is a big deal, and I'm so excited. And the last thing I want to do is overstep my bounds on this call with my excitement and do something to potentially jeopardize this transaction. I can tell you that we see a lot of opportunities, a lot of revenue opportunities for NIC and a lot of revenue opportunities for Tyler. It's going to take some time just like all of our acquisitions. As you know, you've followed us a long time. We like -- we're a good acquirer. We bring companies in, we take our time. Our first model is make sure we don't break the great company that they've built. We're going to sit down with them and and really map out sort of what those opportunities are and what's the best timeline to achieve them while also keeping their strong business intact. 
I could just tell you that when we look at those and we look at how the the complementary nature of our businesses and the ability to utilize some of their statewide contracts and what they're doing in payments and what we can learn from them and what they might can learn from us, it's pretty exciting. And I think I really look forward to sharing a lot more detail as it goes on. But I'm going to try to keep my comments at a pretty high level at this point."

And in fact, I mentioned in Kirk's response, how C&J last year really had a record year in sales, and a lot of that has to do with the fact of the acquisitions we've done over the years and how we've integrated them and opened up new markets and aligned them with our business. And that's exactly what we see with the NIC acquisition. It's a great company, as you mentioned. It's the company built on integrity. They've got a great management team, really strong management team, as you'd expect. And we're just really excited about bringing them into the Tyler fold and getting to work together."

And what we've seen, for example, and what I've talked about in the past, I've mentioned that last year may have been a little bit more difficult year on sales in our mid- to upper level ERP space. That's really just more a reflection of people being able to hang on with their systems for another year and sort of sweat it out. And it's my expectation that there will -- that pent-up demand will be released. It's hard to predict exactly when. 
And again, what we've talked about over the last year is we really leaned back on our experience back during the Great Recession. While it's not -- it's certainly not apples-to-apples. There's a lot of similarities. And what we saw there was sort of a depressed market for a couple of years, but then that market opened up and it sort of exploded. And the fact that we were able to invest and improve our competitive position that really put us in a great position to capitalize on that. And that's the way we feel about it now. We're just as optimistic about the future as I was coming into 2020."

And again, thanks for the comments on NIC, we couldn't agree more on the cultural fit. And I want to spend another second of that before I get to your other questions, is we've done a lot of acquisitions over the years. And the 1 thing that we've learned and the 1 thing we primarily look for is culture alignment because in our experience, acquisitions can so they can look great on paper and they can look great in banker books and all that stuff that you see. But really, it doesn't matter if the cultures aren't aligned, it just doesn't matter how good it looks on paper. They just ultimately won't work out. And that's 1 of the things that's so exciting about this. And as I spent time with Harry, their CEO, and as we got to know their management team, just seeing their culture and seeing the way they approach the business and how it aligned with us and their vision. That's just a very key point. 
As it relates to the agreement itself, I believe the agreement got filed or will be filed today. So as you talk about no shop provisions and termination fees, those are all fairly standard negotiated provisions that you'll see in these sort of public company deals. I would say, the terms of those in this agreement are somewhat typical. I'll let you go look those up and decide on those, but yes, they're fairly typical and things that you'd expect to see in this type of transaction. 
On the financing front, I'm glad you raised that. We've talked about forever our strong balance sheet, and you're right. When you look at a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we believe it's going to be pretty manageable, maybe somewhere in the 3x high 2s to low 3s, but somewhere around there, but will be pretty reasonable. The 1 thing I want to specifically emphasize is as well, this is a significant amount of debt, and it's something that we haven't carried for a long time. It's my goal and my anticipation as we move to more committed financing that we're going to maintain a lot of flexibility, and we're going to -- our balance sheet is still going to look very strong. It's one of the things I'm committed to doing and putting this permanent financing together. I spoke to our Board about it 2 days ago. It's really important that how we structure this debt allows us to continue to do the things that we've done so successfully for so many years and have been a big part of our success, things like the flexibility to continue to invest in all of our R&D initiatives that continue to do acquisitions as they arise and opportunistic share repurchases. It's my anticipation that we'll still have that flexibility over the next several years as we work with the debt that I believe to be very manageable. So I appreciate that question. Great."

I wouldn't be cautious maybe the wrong word. But it really has more to do with the change in administration. And so there will probably be a little bit of a pause there on deals. We saw that with some deals in Q4 once the election happened. And you get a change administration, you get change in organization leadership and priorities. There's just a little bit of a pause. But I'd expect as the year continues to roll out, and particularly with some of the initiatives that we're seeing come out of Congress that's going to pick back up as the year goes on."

Thanks, Scott. I think it's going to be a mix of a little bit of both. And part of it is, as we think about going through a cloud -- really the cloud transformation at Tyler, and as you know, that's more than just getting your products into a certain state. It eventually really impacts the way, not just how you develop products, but how you deploy and support them. Part of that strategy, as you mentioned, is migrating our customers out of the Tyler systems and moving them over to AWS. The principal foundational piece of that, though, is making sure that our products as we move them over there, that they operate in at least an efficient, if not more efficient way than they are in the current Tyler cloud centers. And that's what we're operating on now. I think you'll see over -- and when we talk about over the next 3 years, that doesn't mean all of them are all going a sudden be magically there at December 31, 2023, they will be getting there in different stages along the way, some sooner than others. 
And I think as we go forward and we think about those plans, you'll start to see us develop plans where perhaps new customers are all going into the AWS world. You'll see certain areas where our products already are more cloud efficient or closer that we will become more aggressive with our existing customers. And so it's going to be a little bit of a blended mix. And that's also part of why we created this group. I mean, this group was created for a number of reasons. It's very exciting. Jeff, as you mentioned, he's he's been here almost 30 years. He knows our business inside and out. He's the perfect guy to oversee and coordinate. And that's really part of what this role is. It's a Tyler-wide, company-wide coordination of all of these multiple streams that you're talking about. It's not just getting our products there. It's getting our plans on migration. It's getting plans on getting out of the Tyler data centers. It's improving our IT infrastructure, making information security standard discipline. It's all the things that's starting to build, how we're going to deploy and support and all of that. And so it's a comprehensive effort. And you'll -- we'll continue to talk more about it each quarter, each -- every 3 months, 6 months, and we'll talk about the progress and as these plans evolve and they get a little more specific. But at a high level, that's where it is. 
And Brian, we've talked before on the margins as we move people in the cloud world, we expect significant margin improvement and significant revenue improvement, both getting them on the subscription, but then also getting our products more cloud efficient, we'll help margins, getting to where we have fewer releases, and they're deployed easier. It will help margins. Everything that's all about the cloud transformation, and that's all going to help over the coming years."

As you look at their overall revenue growth moving forward, I would say my expectation is it would be more in line with Tyler's. And when you look over the last couple of years, if you look at it sort of in isolation on a 10-K or something, it may look like their overall revenue growth may have been lower. Part of that was the fact that there was a significant contract that they inherited. It wasn't when they originally sold with the state of Texas. And and when they lost that, that was a significant headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. They've got a number of initiatives inside their business that will be growing at accelerated rates, just like we do at Tyler. Some of these specific solution initiatives, I think you're going to see significant growth in their payments business. 
They -- as I mentioned in my remarks, they've recently won a contract with the state of Florida to not only provide statewide payments across the state, but also it provides opportunities under that contract to do payments at the local level. So that's kind of at a high level, the way I see it right now."

But we also are seeing Socrata play a role in areas all across our company.

I mean -- and you're right. When I look out to the future, and I look at the future of the public sector market, I see the things like cloud and the provision of subscription-based essential functionality, it's digital services. It's these transaction-based revenues. It's data and insights. It's our connected communities vision. And it's bringing all that stuff together in a way that really nobody else can. And so yes, to your question, there's a little bit of that, but we want to make sure that we get in there and and add all these extra values and services to our clients that nobody else can deliver."

Obviously, they've been in business for several years before that. And literally, they have been on our radar since the day they went public. We've had internal conversations about them over the years. I would say that part of it is we've been so focused on our mission of getting really all the essential functional areas across local government as I said before, we talked about this when we did the MicroPact acquisition, even Socrata, it's areas that we've always been interested in, but we just haven't gotten there. I can't tell you why I didn't specifically pick up the phone and call Harry 3 years ago as opposed to this fall. But I can tell you that we spent a lot of time and a lot of work on it even before I made that call. And again, we've had conversations for a long time. And their business is growing mature. Our business has grown and matured. And as we've grown and gotten more solutions and more opportunities. And as they've grown and increased their footprint, we really see the balance. 
And when you look at things like the prior question on payments, this is a big strategic driver for us, and it's a big strategic driver for them. And they've got a very significant payments business. We've got an emerging payments business, and we see the opportunities there. So it's just 1 of those things. But all I can say is we're very excited that we've made this deal that we've made today now. 
As you talk about our M&A strategy going forward, I would be surprised if this is the only acquisition we do this year, but this is also a big acquisition. It's going to require a lot of focus on our management teams. And this is something we need to get right. And so I could see at some point, particularly after this deal closes as we go into the second half of the year that sort of like we were back in 2019, where we may take a little bit of deliberate pause. But as I mentioned, we're going to have the financial wherewithal to continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, and we're going to continue to look like we always have. And I continue -- I expect that will continue to be part of our road map going forward as we continue to see strategic products or ways to increase our TAM or expand our offerings in areas where we already have a large footprint. 
So our overall strategy won't change. It will -- again, it will probably -- as we get to the second half of the year a little bit more like 2019."

But when we see things like in our Incode group, which is really the lower end of ERP, it's where our schools is. It's where utility billing and things like that, that group right now are seeing record win rates. I mean their win rates are approaching 90%, which is just off the charts. And so we get really excited about when we think about the market returning. When we see things, I mentioned earlier on the call, our Courts & Justice Group, 2020 was actually the highest sales year for our Courts & Justice division. Now their PoC accounting, so it's not all going to flow in right away. But you remember back in 2014, 2015, when that group had really high sales, which was when California opened up, that's a process of -- I mean, not only our Odyssey continues to be strong, but all the investments we've made around there and the expanded products, including acquisitions, which was your question earlier and being able to sell all those products and have more functionality and be more competitive. We talk about it public safety. Public safety had another $1 million-plus license deal this quarter. They're just on a roll. They had a very big win in Genesee County, Michigan. Against Motorola and Central Square. And again, that's a result of our competitiveness, our ability to check more boxes on the RFPs, our ability to go upmarket. And again, all these acquisitions that are differentiating these offerings. So those are a few examples, and we just like where we sit right now, and we're anxiously await for pre-pandemic market."

It's basically a a form of a termination for convenience provision that's in the contract, both -- neither we nor the state of Texas expect those to be exercised. The state has made some very positive comments about the relationship they've had with Texas as we've provided e-filing services for the last few years and made enhancements. And so we won that renewal in a very competitive process. And with some enhancements to it, it also has, I believe, [ 5 1-year ] extensions on the end of the or 51 year opportunities to extend it. But because there are some termination for convenience provisions that we wouldn't expect to be exercised from an accounting perspective, they prevent us from being able to put the full amount in backlog like we normally would with a a fixed fee e-filing arrangement. So I think there's only less than $5 million of that contract will go into backlog sort of each quarter. 
So doesn't affect revenues, but it clearly affects the optics. We've talked over a long time about the lumpiness of some of the bookings. But this one was one that just didn't quite fit with the accounting provisions. But it's a great extension, a great test onto the work we've done with Texas over the last few years. It's clearly our biggest e-filing arrangement and getting that extension is a major win for us."

Our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter, and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. Recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 17% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel.
Our revenue mix and cost efficiencies contributed to 120 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.9%. Cash flow has been very robust throughout the year. And both cash from operations and free cash flow ended the year strong and grew 16.5% and 25.8%, respectively. This was our highest fourth quarter and full year cash flow ever. And for the year, free cash flow grew 53.6% to $326.6 million.
Bookings for the quarter were relatively flat with the prior year at approximately $333 million. Our largest deal of the quarter, which was also the largest single contract in our history, was a 5-year extension of our e-filing arrangement with the Texas Office of Court Administration valued at approximately $98 million. The extension also included e-filing insights, a Socrata-based interactive reporting layer that eliminates hundreds of hours of manual reporting activities and gets clerks in all 254 counties the ability to monitor 50,000 daily filings, so they can identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies and improve the experience for the public. 
However, due to certain contract provisions, only a very small portion of the value of this contract was included in backlog and bookings. If the entire value of this contract have been included in backlogs, bookings growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 28%.
Our largest new SaaS deal in the fourth quarter was with Jackson County, Missouri, for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution, as well as appraisal services, valued at approximately $18 million. 
Other significant contracts signed this quarter included a multi-suite license arrangement for our Munis ERP, EnerGov civic services and Socrata Data Insights solutions with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands valued at approximately $5 million; SaaS agreements with the city of Jacksonville, Florida for our EnerGov civic services solution and with Stark County, Ohio for our public safety solutions, each valued at approximately $4 million; and 10 SaaS deals and 3 license contracts for various Tyler solutions, each valued at over $1 million. 
Brian will discuss our guidance for 2021, but I'd like to update you on some of our plans surrounding our strategic initiatives to accelerate our move to the cloud. Our 2021 plan includes accelerated and new cloud investments across the spectrum of our products. Our plan includes approximately $23 million of investments in cloud product development in 2021 and a total investment of more than $52 million over the next 3 years with the majority of that expensed. As a result of these investments, we expect by the end of 2023 all of our major applications will either be cloud-native or cloud efficient for deployment at AWS.
We've also made some organizational changes, some of which were announced earlier this week, to focus additional leadership on our cloud initiatives as well as streamlining internal technology and security operations and driving other technology efficiency objectives.
Now I'd like for Brian to provide detail on the results for the quarter."

This morning, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. 
In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. 
We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website, under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
Our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $283.3 million, down 1.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $283.4 million, down 1.4%. Software license revenues declined 46%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a very high mix of subscription deals at 73%. Software services revenues declined to 18% as some projects slowed as a result of COVID-19. And our shift to remote delivery of most services also resulted in a $5 million decline in billable travel revenue. 
On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 17%. We added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 50 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $74 million in contract value. 
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 54% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.5 years compared to 4.4 years last year.
Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $24.6 million, up 13.3%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.5 million, up 5.1%; and e-payments revenue of $9.1 million, up 30.6%. 
For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $850 million, up 10.4%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q4 was approximately $278 million, up 17.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $98 million, up 13.3%; and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $474 million, up 5.8%. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.59 billion, up 9.4%. 
As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were relatively flat at $333 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, down 1.3%, against a tough comparison that included the 2 large North Carolina Courts deals, totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. If the full amount of the Texas e-filing extension had been included in our backlog, Q4 bookings would have grown 28%, and trailing 12-month bookings would have grown 5.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $11 million in new annual recurring revenue. The bookings growth rate was also affected by the shorter average term for new subscription contract. 
As it was throughout the year, cash flow was robust in the fourth quarter as cash from operations increased 16.5% to $88.8 million, and free cash flow grew 25.8% to $83.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. 
Our earnings release has the full details of our 2021 guidance, which excludes the impact of NIC and any other acquisitions which may be completed during the year. We expect to update our guidance to include the NIC transaction after it closes.
With regard to revenue and earnings, we expect 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP revenues will both be between $1.190 billion and $1.220 billion, representing a range of growth from 6.6% to 9.3%. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.03 and $4.21 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on our GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.65 and $5.77, representing an increase of 2.4% to 4.5%. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42.5 million and 43 million shares.
As we look ahead to 2021, it's clear that we won't be back to normal for some time. We've said on prior calls that we anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 would continue into 2021, and our plan for this year anticipates this ongoing uncertainty. Nonetheless, we're excited about our opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and achieve our margin objectives for this year. Revenue growth, while below our normal targets, is expected to be significantly above the 2020 level.
Just to refresh your memory, as we entered 2020, our guidance was for non-GAAP revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% and for margins to be relatively flat with 2019 with an expectation of resuming our margin expansion trajectory in 2021. COVID-19 obviously resulted in the 2020 performance that was very different from our initial guidance as we finished with low single-digit revenue growth and 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. 
We've talked before about how some of the factors that led to margin improvement in 2020 are sustainable while others are not. Those factors include a favorable change in our revenue mix from a decline in low-margin revenues like professional services and billable travel as well as cost savings in areas like travel, marketing and employee health care.
I'd like to point out a few of the factors that are expected to impact our margins this year. Employee health care expense will have a significant impact on operating margins in 2021. During 2020, we saw an unexpected decline in our health care costs as the pandemic curtailed elective surgeries, checkups and much of our employees' nonurgent health care. And our net health claims expense per employee declined to 8.4% for the year. As those costs return to normal pre-pandemic levels in 2021, coupled with inflation, we are expecting an increase of approximately $13 million or 21% over the reduced level in 2020. 
Also our diluted share count is expected to be 575,000 to 1.1 million shares higher than in 2020. We issued approximately 1.3 million shares under our stock compensation plans in 2020, including 1.2 million shares from the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. Our higher stock price also impacts the dilution calculation. If our diluted share count in 2021 was the same as 2020, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would be about $0.18 higher. 
As a reminder, beginning in 2018, we began a shift in our long-term incentive equity to a mix of options, restricted stock units and performance stock units. As that shift continues, we anticipate a significantly less dilutive impact of long-term stock incentives going forward. 
Our guidance implies operating margins that are modestly below the 2020 level but above our 2019 operating margins. That trend is generally in line with the trajectory we targeted at the beginning of 2020. And if we achieve our plan, we'll finish 2021 with margins in line with or above what we would have expected pre-pandemic. 
So to conclude, our 2021 plan reflects a solid combination of organic revenue growth and strategic growth investments, especially around our cloud transition. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

While 2020 presented a myriad of challenges, we view many of those challenges as creating opportunities that Tyler is well positioned to take advantage of. Our financial position is stronger than it was a year ago with more than $800 million in cash and investments and no debt on our balance sheet today.
We've been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, and they are all on track. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. 
Our client base is large and diverse with more than 27,000 implementations, and it represents our greatest asset for both future sales opportunities and the dependable revenue stream it produces. And we have a deep and experienced management team that has weathered difficult economic times in the past. All of these factors make us confident that we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize as markets return to normal. 
So with that, I'd like to turn to this morning's extremely exciting announcement that Tyler has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NIC Inc. in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion. We're going to spend a bit of time today walking you through why NIC is an exceptional addition to the Tyler family, and we'll leave time at the end of the presentation for your questions. 
But before we begin, I'll remind you that we have posted a presentation on the acquisition on our IR website, and I'll refer to some of those slides in my remarks. I would draw your attention to the disclosures on Slide 3 related to solicitation materials and remind you that additional information is available on the websites of both Tyler and NIC. 
So with that out of way, I'd like to start by highlighting the significant benefits this acquisition, the largest in Tyler's history by a wide margin, brings to our business. NIC is a leading digital solutions provider to state and federal government entities and will meaningfully increase Tyler's presence in both of those sectors, building on the entry points we achieved via our acquisitions of MicroPact and Socrata a couple of years ago. NIC also brings to Tyler a very large incremental payments processing business for governments, allowing us to meaningfully grow a revenue stream that is highly recurring in nature. NIC's unique, statewide contract structure and complementary portfolio of offerings will allow Tyler to better serve a broader customer base with a more complete set of solutions. And perhaps most importantly, Tyler and NIC are 2 companies whose cultures are complementary and well aligned, which I will touch on more in a moment.
In terms of the transaction specifics, this is an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $34 per share, which equates to an equity value of $2.3 billion or an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, inclusive of NIC balance sheet cash. We have committed financing to fund the transaction in the form of cash on hand and a $1.6 billion bridge facility, which we anticipate replacing with permanent capital between signing and closing. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Boards of Directors and is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the NIC shareholders. We expect this combination to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in the first year. It's important to note that we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet post transaction with a very reasonable balance of leverage and liquidity. 
I'd like to briefly touch again on the point around culture and how that played into the rationale for this acquisition. NIC is a company that's been on Tyler's radar screen for quite some time, and we have admired their reputation in the marketplace from a distance. As I and the rest of the Tyler management team got to know our counterparts at NIC over the last few weeks and months, it became increasingly clear how similar our 2 organizations are, as you can see from the similarities in our respective missions. Tyler and NIC are 2 companies built on integrity and focused on delivering differentiated value for all of our respective constituents: governments, businesses, citizens, employees and shareholders. I view this combination as a continued realization of our mission of empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer and stronger communities.
The pandemic has accelerated the shift by governments to online services and electronic payments as more citizens and businesses are interacting digitally with government. NIC is uniquely positioned with its deep expertise and robust digital solutions to partner with us in making government more efficient and more accessible to citizens. NIC's capabilities and vision align with and are complementary to our Connected Communities vision and will advance our efforts to bring that to our clients. 
On Slide 6, we've included a bit more information on NIC as well as some key relevant statistics. The company is a leading digital solutions and payments provider, serving more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC has enterprise-wide partnerships with 31 states and a robust payments business that currently processes $24 billion in payments annually, and that amount will increase significantly with the implementation of the payments processing contract NIC recently signed with the state of Florida.
The company's broad set of solutions and a unique go-to-market contracting model allow NIC to become deeply embedded with their clients, resulting in predictable, highly recurring revenue growth. For the fiscal year ended 2020, NIC delivered revenue of more than $460.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of about $108.8 million. NIC's complete fourth quarter earnings were also released this morning, and you will find their complete results on their website.
On Slide 7, you can see the breadth of NIC's leading portfolio of digital government solutions. At a high level, the company is focused on delivering user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. NIC serves both businesses and citizens with solutions to tackle information, interactions and payments for a wide range of government agencies, and importantly, including a variety of delivery methods such as Gov2Go, NIC's unique proprietary, cross-agency mobile platform designed specifically for citizens to interact with government. 
We drilled down a bit further into NIC's focus areas on Slide 8, and importantly, how NIC solutions map to our existing portfolio. As we assess NIC's fit with Tyler, we thought about their portfolio of offerings through a number of lenses. Certain of NIC's end markets, such as their solutions for businesses, courts and health care, are highly complementary with Tyler's. NIC's presence in these sectors at the state and federal level are naturally aligned with Tyler's established presence at the local level. Other areas, such as outdoor recreation and taxes, represent natural adjacencies to expand Tyler's current business, while a sector, like motor vehicles, is a clear growth opportunity. 
The key takeaway from our assessment of NIC's portfolio is that there are a number of areas where Tyler's existing businesses will benefit from NIC quickly and where avenues of growth should open up organically for both of us over time. 
A similar fact pattern emerges if you look at NIC's geographic footprint, which is shown on Slide 9. NIC has established relationships across the nation, including geographic alignment with Tyler in several complementary solution areas, with 16 states where both companies have active contracts at different agencies. NIC's State Enterprise and Platform Solutions businesses, both of which we'll touch on in greater detail in a moment, already have great breadth and depth. And we see a number of white space opportunities to expand these platforms as part of the Tyler portfolio. We also view NIC's federal client relationships as a natural fit to meaningfully expand our existing Tyler federal business. 
On Slide 10, we provide a more detailed overview of NIC's State Enterprise business, including a look at the long-term relationships the company has built over time. NIC's State Enterprise solution offers a unique approach to working with governments by putting dedicated local teams in capital cities for support and developing services and solutions that are relevant to all agencies within a state government. NIC is able to deploy best practices gleaned over a number of decades and leverage a deep foundation of technological capabilities in tailoring solutions to fit specialized needs. 
The company's flexible statewide contract vehicles allow governments to avoid cumbersome procurement processes by authorizing NIC to develop and implement a wide range of solutions across a number of different agencies. These long-term contracts lead to clear line of sight, both operationally and from a revenue perspective, as evidenced by NIC's historic ability to grow same-state revenue at 8% plus. 
NIC's Platform Solutions business, which is illustrated on Slide 11, includes comprehensive agency-specific vertical solutions that are the product of significant investments NIC has made in recent years, both organically and inorganically, and represent scalable solutions designed to address specific areas of market demand.
On the payment side, NIC has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed for governments that can be integrated into state enterprise systems or offered standalone. Recently acquired solutions and licensing and health care are already showing early wins with new contracts awards across 5 states, while NIC has successfully deployed various outdoor recreation solutions in 12 states. The early momentum in this piece of NIC's business is clearly evident and is very exciting for Tyler. We see significant opportunity to drive outside growth with these platform technologies. 
Turning to Slide 12. I would like to reiterate how strongly we believe in the merits of this transaction and view the addition of NIC as a combination of complementary strengths. With this acquisition, we will create a public sector technology solutions leader that furthers our goal of connecting governments with constituents and businesses in a way that is seamless and transparent. 
I'd close by noting how delighted we are to soon welcome NIC and their employees to the Tyler family. I remind you that we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approval by NIC stockholders. As a result, we are somewhat limited in our ability to discuss certain aspects of the transaction at this time. 
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

Just trying to get a sense on whether you see you guys -- if you see any sort of defrosting of the market a little bit. You still have some nice deals this quarter. But clearly, it's still challenging. So how do you see that maybe playing out over '21? 
And then just on the NIC deal, clearly, it seems like you're going to leave the business alone for at least the near term. Can you just talk about some of the synergies maybe you see from a top line perspective, at least, as you look out over the next 1 or 2 years, maybe the 1 or 2 things that you think are maybe lower-hanging fruit on that front?"

On your first question around budgets and activity level, as we've said, going in -- we said at the last quarterly call. Our anticipation was that COVID would continue into 2021. As you recall, most of our clients, their budget seasons are June 30, and so they're in the midst of those budgets. 
When you look back at 2020 and some of the comments I made during the year, the pandemic actually was impacting different parts of our business a little bit differently. We saw a little more impact in our ERP space, particularly at the mid and higher end, and a little bit more in the appraisal and tax space. We actually had a really good sales year last year at courts and justice. We may talk about that a little bit later. It's actually a record sales year for them. But that number of RFPs and demos and all that slowdown really impacted certain parts of our business more. And it's just anecdotal right now. 
We're now just 1 month into 2021. But in -- what we've seen a little bit, particularly on the ERP side, we don't only don't talk about awards and wins, but the awards in January and the contract values was something that's certainly up over the last 8 months and is a positive sign. We see things over in like in the appraisal and tax area where there are some fairly significant projects, some fairly large RFPs that really got put on the shelf in Q2 of last year. We're starting to see those starting to come out again. That doesn't necessarily mean immediate contracts, as you know, or immediate deals, but we are seeing some of that.
There's still going to be headwinds in 2021. Obviously, with the COVID relief that just passed, there's some uncertainty about what that's going to mean. We're still seeing pushes and delays. 
But I think your comment about defrosting, I'm kind of getting an early sense. But again, it's anecdotal right now. I think we'll know a lot more, obviously, at the end of Q1. And as the vaccine rolls out and people start getting more comfortable, I think we'll start getting better clear sight on that.
On the NIC front, I just want to say a couple of things. I've mentioned in the opening remarks a couple of times now about stockholder approval and regulatory approval. There are certain things I can say right now and certain things I can't. I'm going to err right now on the conservative side because this is a big deal, and I'm so excited. And the last thing I want to do is overstep my bounds on this call with my excitement and do something to potentially jeopardize this transaction. I can tell you that we see a lot of revenue opportunities for NIC and a lot of revenue opportunities for Tyler. It's going to take some time, just like all of our acquisitions. As you know, you followed us a long time. We like -- we're a good acquirer. We bring companies in. We take our time. Our first model is make sure we don't break the great company that they've built. We're going to sit down with them and really map out sort of what those opportunities are and what's the best time line to achieve them while also keeping their strong business intact.
I could just tell you that when we look at those and we look at how the complementary nature of our businesses and the ability to utilize some of their statewide contracts and what they're doing in payments and what we can learn from them and what they might can learn from us, it's pretty exciting. And I think I really look forward to sharing a lot more detail as it goes on, but I'm going to try to keep my comments at a pretty high level at this point."

You've seen that throughout other Tyler acquisitions, and it's one of the things I'm most proud of. And in fact, I mentioned in Kirk's response, how C&J last year really had a record year in sales. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that the acquisitions we've done over the years and how we've integrated them and opened up new markets and aligned them with our business. 
And that's exactly what we see with the NIC acquisition. It's a great company, as you mentioned. It's a company built on integrity.

That's really just more a reflection of people being able to hang on with their systems for another year and sort of sweat it out. And it's my expectation that there will -- that pent-up demand will be released. It's hard to predict exactly when.
And again, what we've talked about over the last year is we really leaned back on our experience back during the Great Recession. While it's not -- it's certainly not apples-to-apples. There's a lot of similarities. And what we saw there was sort of a depressed market for a couple of years, but then that market opened up, and it sort of exploded. And the fact that we were able to invest and improve our competitive position, that really put us in a great position to capitalize on that. And that's the way we feel about it now.

And I want to spend another second on that before I get to your other questions is we've done a lot of acquisitions over the years. And the one thing that we've learned and the one thing we primarily look for is culture alignment because, in our experience, acquisitions can -- they can look great on paper and they can look great in banker books and all that stuff that you see. But really, it doesn't matter if the cultures aren't aligned. It just doesn't matter how good it looks on paper. They just ultimately won't work out, and that's one of the things that's so exciting about this. 
And as I spent time with Harry, their CEO, and as we got to know their management team, just seeing their culture and seeing the way they approach the business and how it aligned with us and their vision, that's just a very key point.
As it relates to the agreement itself, I believe the agreement got filed or will be filed today. So as you talk about no-shop provisions and termination fees, those are all fairly standard, negotiated provisions that you'll see in these sort of public company deals. I would say the terms of those in this agreement are somewhat typical. I'll let you go look those up and decide on those. But yes, they're fairly typical and things that you'd expect to see in this type of transaction. 
On the financing front, I'm glad you raised that. We've talked about forever our strong balance sheet, and you're right. When you look at a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we believe it's going to be pretty manageable, maybe somewhere in the 3x, high 2s to low 3s, but somewhere around there would be pretty reasonable. 
The one thing I want to specifically emphasize is, as well, this is a significant amount of debt, and it's something that we haven't carried for a long time. It's my goal and my anticipation as we move to more committed financing that we're going to maintain a lot of flexibility, and we're going to -- our balance sheet is still going to look very strong. It's one of the things I'm committed to doing and putting this permanent financing together. I spoke to our Board about it 2 days ago. It's really important that -- how we structure this debt allows us to continue to do the things that we've done so successfully for so many years and have been a big part of our success, things like the flexibility to continue to invest in all of our R&D initiatives that continue to do acquisitions as they arise and opportunistic share repurchases. It's my anticipation that we'll still have that flexibility over the next several years as we work with the debt that I believe to be very manageable. So I appreciate that question."

And as we look in 2021, we see the state budgets actually starting to come back and opportunities starting to open up. And actually, right now, at the federal level, it's a little bit more cautious. I wouldn't -- cautious may be the wrong word, but it really has more to do with the change in administration. And so there will probably be a little bit of a pause there on deals. We saw that with some deals in Q4. Once the election happened and you get a change administration, you get a change in organization leadership and priorities, there's just a little bit of a pause.

I guess just kind of a 2-part question there is, first, how do we think about margin structure and what the new platform looks like now that you're getting more visibility around kind of time frames, et cetera, gross margin structure, obviously, on those customers? And then two, how do you migrate those customers? Is this something that you try to push relatively quickly to get some of your current subscription-based customers to move over to that? Or do you allow them to kind of naturally migrate there over a longer time frame?"

Thanks, Scott. I think it's going to be a mix of a little bit of both. And part of it is, as we think about going through a cloud -- really the cloud transformation at Tyler, and as you know, that's more than just getting your products into a certain state, it eventually really impacts the way, not just how you develop products, but how you deploy and support them. 
Part of that strategy, as you mentioned, is migrating our customers out of the Tyler systems and moving them over to AWS. The principal foundational piece of that, though, is making sure that our products, as we move them over there, that they operate in at least an efficient, if not more efficient, way than they are in the current Tyler cloud centers. And that's what we're operating on now. 
I think you'll see over -- and when we talk about over the next 3 years, that doesn't mean all of them are all going a sudden be magically there at December 31, 2023. They will be getting there in different stages along the way, some sooner than others. And I think as we go forward and we think about those plans, you'll start to see us develop plans where perhaps new customers are all going into the AWS world. You'll see certain areas where our products already are more cloud-efficient or closer that we will become more aggressive with our existing customers. And so it's going to be a little bit of a blended mix. 
And that's also part of why we created this group. I mean, this group was created for a number of reasons. It's very exciting. Jeff, as you mentioned, he's been here almost 30 years. He knows our business inside and out. He's the perfect guy to oversee and coordinate. And that's really part of what this role is. It's a Tyler-wide, company-wide coordination of all of these multiple streams that you're talking about. It's not just getting our products there. It's getting our plans on migration. It's getting plans on getting out of the Tyler data centers. It's improving our IT infrastructure, making information security standard discipline. It's all the things that's starting to build, how we're going to deploy and support and all of that. And so it's a comprehensive effort. And you'll -- we'll continue to talk more about it each quarter, each -- every 3 months, 6 months, and we'll talk about the progress and as these plans evolve and they get a little more specific. But at a high level, that's where it is. 
And Brian, we've talked before on the margins as we move people into the cloud world, we expect significant margin improvement and significant revenue improvement, both getting them on the subscription. But then also getting our products more cloud-efficient will help margins. Getting to where we have fewer releases and they're deployed easier will help margins. Everything that's all about the cloud transformation, that's all going to help over the coming years."

What I'd say to that is that really shows their innovation ingenuity, and it shows their ability to spin up something quickly to meet the needs and to roll it out really quickly. 
And my -- the way I view it is, while that was -- it's something that was really tied to the pandemic, that's something that is exciting to see that they could execute on that and to think that we can do things like that in other areas, particularly as we combine with some of the Tyler products. 
As you look at their overall revenue growth moving forward, I would say my expectation is it would be more in line with Tyler's. And when you look over the last couple of years, if you look at it sort of in isolation on a 10-K or something, it may look like their overall revenue growth may have been lower. Part of that was the fact that there was a significant contract that they inherited. It wasn't when they originally sold with the state of Texas. And when they lost that, that was a significant headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. They've got a number of initiatives inside their business that will be growing at accelerated rates, just like we do at Tyler. Some of these specific solution initiatives, I think, you're going to see significant growth in their payments business.
They -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, they've recently won a contract with the state of Florida to not only provide statewide payments across the state, but also it provides opportunities under that contract to do payments at the local level. So that's kind of at a high level, the way I see it right now."

Obviously, we -- the state of Texas contract was an extension of our previous relationship. We've done a lot of things there with the state to building a lot of value to help our ability to recapture that contract. And there's other upsides that come with that contract. 
One of the things that I've talked about over the last couple of quarters, and I certainly have it here. Yes, Socrata plays a role. It's another value-add that we do. But we also are seeing Socrata play a role in areas all across our company. And when we purchased Socrata, I guess that was back in 2018, one of the things that we really liked about it is not only do we believe that the future public sector is -- will have a focus around data and insights, but how it can really differentiate our products going forward. And I've talked about in public safety deals, we're starting to talk about it in our ERP deals, it's making a big difference. It's hard to quantify. But when we have that kind of functionality and that kind of insights and our competitors don't, it's just -- it's a huge add, and it's something that's a big differentiator. 
As it relates to ""integration"" of NIC, again, we're still very in the early stages of that, and we still have a lot of conversations to have with their management team. This deal, while it's been sort of going on in the back works for -- I think I first reached out to Harry back in September and -- but things have been accelerating. And we've talked a lot about the opportunities. But we've got a lot of work to do to get our teams and their teams together and start thinking about those things. Some of those are still going to be a little bit limited, again, because of regulatory restraints. But all I can tell you and continue to emphasize is how excited I am, how excited our team is and I believe how excited their team is for the opportunities that we have that we can go out there and do together when we combine these 2 leadership roles."

It's these transaction-based revenues. It's data and insights. It's our Connected Communities vision. And it's bringing all that stuff together in a way that really nobody else can.

Obviously, they've been in business for several years before that. And literally, they have been on our radar since the day they went public. We've had internal conversations about them over the years. 
I would say that part of it is we've been so focused on our mission of getting really all the essential functional areas across local government. As I said before, we talked about this when we did the MicroPact acquisition, even Socrata. It's areas that we've always been interested in, but we just haven't gotten there. 
I can't tell you why I didn't specifically pick up the phone and call Harry 3 years ago as opposed to this fall, but I can tell you that we spent a lot of time and a lot of work on it, even before I made that call. And again, we've had conversations for a long time. And their business has grown and matured. Our business has grown and matured. And as we've grown and gotten more solutions and more opportunities and as they've grown and increased their footprint, we really see the balance. 
And when you look at things like the prior question on payments, this is a big strategic driver for us, and it's a big strategic driver for them. And they've got a very significant payments business. We've got an emerging payments business, and we see the opportunities there. So it's just one of those things, but all I can say is we're very excited that we've made this deal that we've made today now. 
As you talk about our M&A strategy going forward, I would be surprised if this is the only acquisition we do this year, but this is also a big acquisition. It's going to require a lot of focus on our management teams, and this is something we need to get right. And so I could see, at some point, particularly after this deal closes, as we go into the second half of the year that sort of like we were back in 2019, where we may take a little bit of deliberate pause. But as I mentioned, we're going to have the financial wherewithal to continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, and we're going to continue to look like we always have. And I continue -- I expect that will continue to be part of our road map going forward as we continue to see strategic products or ways to increase our TAM or expand our offerings in areas where we already have a large footprint.
So our overall strategy won't change. It will -- again, it will probably -- as we get to the second half of the year a little bit more like 2019."

And what we've seen in the market is that some of our competitors are not making the investments that they may have historically done, and we've seen a little bit of that. 
But when we see things like in our Incode group, which is really the lower end of ERP, it's where our schools is. It's where utility, billing and things like that, our -- that group right now are seeing record win rates. I mean their win rates are approaching 90%, which is just off the charts. And so we get really excited about when we think about the market returning. When we see things like I mentioned earlier on the call our courts and justice group, 2020 was actually the highest sales year for our courts and justice division. Now their POC accounting, so it's not all going to flow in right away. 
But you remember back in 2014, 2015, when that group had really high sales, which was when California opened up, that's a process of -- I mean, not only our Odyssey continues to be strong, but all the investments we've made around there and the expanded products, including acquisitions, which was your question earlier, and being able to sell all those products and have more functionality and be more competitive. We talk about it, public safety. Public safety had another $1 million-plus license deal this quarter. They're just on a roll. They had a very big win in Genesee County, Michigan against Motorola and CentralSquare. 
And again, that's a result of our competitiveness, our ability to check more boxes on the RFPs, our ability to go upmarket. And again, all these acquisitions that are differentiating these offerings. So those are a few examples, and we just like where we sit right now, and we're -- we anxiously await for pre-pandemic market."

Both -- neither we nor the state of Texas expect those to be exercised. The state has made some very positive comments about the relationship they've had with Texas as we've provided e-filing services for the last few years and made enhancements. 
And so we won that renewal in a very competitive process. And with some enhancements to it, it also has, I believe, 5 1-year extensions on the end of -- or 5 1-year opportunities to extend it. But because there are some termination for convenience provisions that we wouldn't expect to be exercised from an accounting perspective, they prevent us from being able to put the full amount in backlog like we normally would with a a fixed fee e-filing arrangement. So I think there's only less than $5 million of that contract will go into backlog sort of each quarter. So doesn't affect revenues, but it clearly affects the optics. 
We've talked over a long time about the lumpiness of some of the bookings, but this one was one that just didn't quite fit with the accounting provisions. But it's a great extension, a great testament to the work we've done with Texas over the last few years. It's clearly our biggest e-filing arrangement, and getting that extension is a major win for us."

Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021.

Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021. Recurring revenues, which comprised 75% of our first quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the ongoing effects of the pandemic.
A favorable revenue mix with strong subscription growth, coupled with cost efficiencies, drove a 270 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.8%. Cash flow continued to be very robust as cash from operations grew 26% and free cash flow grew almost 34%.
We're pleased to see signs of growing activity in our public sector markets and expect that federal stimulus under the American Rescue Plan Act will have a positive impact on government technology spending going forward. Bookings in the first quarter were solid at approximately $247 million, but were down 22.8% against a very challenging comparison with the first quarter of 2020.
Our largest deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement for our Munis ERP solution with the City of Fresno, California valued at approximately $10 million. Other significant SaaS contracts included ERP deals with Hall County, Georgia and Fort Smith, Arkansas and Odyssey courts deal with Val Verde County, Texas.
Our largest on-premises contracts include an ExecuTime time contract with the U.S. Virgin Islands, public safety and citations contracts with Montgomery County, New York and Cicero, Illinois and an EnerGov contract with the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.
So far this year, we've been busy on the M&A front. On March 31, we completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions, DataSpec and ReadySub, for a total purchase price of $12 million in cash. DataSpec is a market-leading provider of software for the electronic management of veterans claims. DataSpec's web-based Software-as-a-Service system called VetraSpec allows for secure electronic claims submission to the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs and reporting capabilities in addition to scheduling, calendaring and payments. DataSpec offers county, state and national versions of VetraSpec, with state solutions making a majority of its implementations. The solution allows state departments to execute and analyze reports on the entire state, individual offices, regions and districts and individual users. 
ReadySub is a cloud-based platform that delivers comprehensive absence and substitute teacher management solutions, serving approximately 1,000 school districts across the United States, with only approximately 20 of which overlapping with Tyler's 2,000 school district clients. The solution helps districts with the labor-intensive and demanding task of filling both planned and unplanned staff absences with the most highly-qualified substitute resources. With continuous pressure due to substitute teacher shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, districts can more easily retain a pool of qualified substitutes and automate the searching and filing of needed substitute spots. Additionally, ReadySub can integrate districts' payroll processes, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining related payroll tasks. 
Most importantly, last week, we completed the $2.3 billion cash acquisition of NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payments company that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. In addition, NIC has extensive experience and expertise and scale in the government payments area, processing more than $24 billion in payments on behalf of citizens and governments last year, which will accelerate Tyler's strategic payments initiative. With the addition of NIC's highly complementary industry-leading digital government solutions and payment services to Tyler's broad client base and multiple sales channels, the combined company will be well equipped to address the tremendous demand at the federal, state and local levels for innovative platform services. Together, Tyler and NIC will connect data and processes across disparate systems and deliver essential products and services to all public sector stakeholders.
NIC had revenues of $460.5 million and net income of $68.6 million in 2020. While NIC will cease to be an SEC reporting company and, therefore, will not issue a first quarter earnings release, they also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plan. NIC's core first quarter revenues, excluding the Tour Health and COVID initiatives that are expected to wind down after the second quarter, grew more than 10% over last year. In addition, NIC's operating income, again excluding the Tour Health and COVID initiatives as well as acquisition costs, rose more than 20%. We are thrilled to welcome the more than 1,000 talented employees of NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub to the Tyler family and look forward to realizing the tremendous benefits these transactions can bring to our collective team members and clients and to Tyler shareholders.
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in th",992,"Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $294.8 million, up 6.6% on a GAAP basis and 6.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As you may recall, we were off to a very strong start in the first 2 months of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly affect our business in March. So we're generally pleased with our growth this quarter against that comparison.
Software license revenues declined 20.3%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a high mix of subscription deals at 66% of new software contract value. Software services revenue declined 8.6% as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our shift to remote delivery of most services resulted in a decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 25.4%. We added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 39 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $98 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 66% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 73% in Q1 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.0 years, compared to 5.9 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $26.9 million, up 22.4%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.6 million, up 4.8%, and e-payments revenue of $11.3 million, up 59.3%. 
For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $886 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $302 million, up 26.3%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $108 million, up 22.4%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $476 million, up 4.1%.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.55 billion, up 3%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were solid at $247 million. However, this was down 22.8% compared to a difficult comparison to Q1 of last year. Last year's first quarter bookings included several large contracts, including 2 significant follow-on SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $38 million.
For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, down 13.3%, although they do not include the majority of the $98 million extension of our Texas e-filing contract signed in Q4 of 2020 because of certain termination provisions in that contract. If the Texas e-filing renewal was fully included, trailing 12-month bookings would have been down only 6.4%. The prior trailing 12-month bookings also included 4 significant SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $123 million. The bookings growth rate in Q1 was also affected by a shorter average term for new subscription contracts. Our subscription -- software subscription booking this quarter added $10.2 million in new annual recurring revenue.
Cash flow was once again very strong in the first quarter as cash from operations increased 26.4% to $71.7 million and free cash flow grew 33.9% to $61.7 million, representing an all-time high for first quarter free cash flow.
We financed the NIC acquisition with a mixture of debt at very attractive rates that gives us a flexible capital structure. In March, we completed a $600 million offering of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026. The notes are convertible into Tyler common stock at a conversion price of $493.44, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price on March 4. On April 21, concurrent with the closing of the NIC acquisition, we entered into a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility with a group of 8 banks. The facility includes a $300 million term note due in 2024 and a $600 million term note due in 2026, both of which can be prepaid without penalty. The facility also includes a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit agreement that replaces our prior $400 million revolver. The combination of the convertible debt, term notes and revolver provide us with a great deal of flexibility. Our balance sheet remains very strong as pro forma net leverage at the NIC closing was approximately 3.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year with net leverage under 2.5x. The current blended interest rate on the $1.75 billion of debt we have outstanding today is 1.1%.
We remain on track to achieve or exceed the annual revenue and EPS guidance that we communicated in February for Tyler, excluding the impact of the NIC acquisition. As Lynn mentioned, NIC also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plans. We expect the NIC acquisition will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in 2021. Because of antitrust restrictions, we took a conservative approach to our integration and strategic planning for NIC prior to closing the transaction last week. We are currently working closely with NIC's leadership to evaluate strategic growth opportunities that take advantage of the combined strength of the 2 businesses and determine the impact on our 2021 plan. We expect to complete the fine-tuning of our joint operating and financial plans for the remainder of the year and issue 2021 guidance for the combined company during the second quarter.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn."

Our team of professionals, including our new NIC team members, executed at a high level in the first quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations for both Tyler and NIC and provided a great start to 2021. Exiting 2020, our financial position was stronger than ever, allowing us to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, including NIC, the largest acquisition in our history with a purchase price of $2.3 billion in cash. We've also been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe we will continue to see an acceleration of the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. I'm happy to say that we are on track with the strategic investments in optimizing our products for the cloud that we discussed on our fourth quarter call.
This quarter, we saw early indicators that our market is beginning to recover as some delayed procurement processes are moving forward and RFP activity is growing from the levels of the second half of 2020. We also expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and have a positive impact on recovery of our markets.
One topic I've not discussed on these calls before pertains to our efforts regarding environmental and social initiatives. Tyler's culture guides our commitment to being a responsible partner in the communities where we live, work and serve our clients. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Tyler Foundation, which since its creation has provided millions of dollars to charities and causes that positively impact our communities.
Our culture is also the foundation for our belief in the importance of providing an inclusive and diverse workplace. We are proud to have been included in the Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity List for the past 2 consecutive years.
The pause in normal office occupancy and business travel due to the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to evaluate our environmental impact across our major office locations and identify opportunities to make our practices more consistent and effective. Last year, we formed an environmental task force to strengthen our sustainability efforts across our office locations and the communities we impact. We achieved a significant milestone last year by responding to Tyler's first invitation to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index survey. More than 3,500 of the world's largest publicly listed companies provide detailed data and background to this global survey for evaluation by its independent sustainability ranking body. Completing the survey was an important opportunity for Tyler to uncover opportunities to strengthen our core responsibility strategy.
We recently published our second annual corporate responsibility report, which is available on our website. This report represents a significant expansion of our reporting on our ESG efforts, and we look forward to continuing our journey and sharing our progress in this area.
Finally, this week, we are virtually hosting more than 5,000 clients at Connect 2021, our annual user conference with a theme called Virtually Possible. Team members from across Tyler are providing nearly 700 hours of valuable content for our clients using our advanced virtual event platform. We are excited to be able to connect with so many clients at our virtual event. And we look forward to connecting with them in person at Connect 2022.
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

There's still a little bit of uncertainty about how to access it. There's certainly money that's been earmarked for IT modernization efforts. And so I think what it's done is it's given our clients a little bit more confidence. I don't know that I would say it necessarily benefits one more than the other. Although one thing that we were noticing last year was in our state business and that -- our state business was off quite a bit last year, and there was a little bit of uncertainty around there. As it turns out, a lot of the state budgets were not as impacted as they first thought a year ago. And so I think the combination of that, along with this American Rescue Plan funding, is providing a boost in that state area. We're starting to see that with some of the RFPs and things that we knew that were intended to come out that got delayed, and we're starting to see some of that. But I'd say, across our entire product lines, I think there's reason for I'd call cautious optimism in what's going on in the markets. And a big part of that is the American Rescue Plan."

And there are very few restrictions on what it can be used for. The funding is just now becoming available to governments. Half of it available roughly now within 60 days of when it was passed. And then the other half is available 12 months from now. So we wouldn't have expected to see much impact on customers' purchasing activities and buying decisions yet, but it certainly points to an opportunity as we move through the year to provide significant relief."

As we mentioned in our comments, we're really just now beginning to sort of dig deep into our integration efforts and our strategic initiatives. And in fact, this week, we had the senior executives of both companies meeting face to face for the first time, which was exciting, and really start brainstorming. And at a high level, we already know sort of some of the major initiatives that we want to take on. And the good news is there's a lot of initiatives. And one thing that we need to do and be careful about is make sure that we prioritize them, look at some of the low-hanging fruit and look at some of the things that will have the most impact.
You mentioned payments. That certainly is one of our largest initiatives. From a technical standpoint, there's still a little bit of work to do there. But NIC is the unquestioned leader in payments in the public sector at the state level. And it's a growing thing for us. What we see there is the ability to leverage our client base and get payments more at the local level and leverage their technical experience to help boost our payments. You talked about other sort of integrations and things. We talked before about their state enterprise contracts, which provide sort of hunting licenses. And in fact, it's those state contracts, which they classify state enterprise revenues, where they go in and then they sort of -- they plant a seed and then they're able to go build additional revenues from there. On their own, this first quarter, the -- those revenues were up 20%, which is pretty exciting. And then what we start talking about is what kind of products do we have at Tyler that we can really just go in and push there. And I don't think there's a lot of technical integration there that's going to need to be done. But that's another one of our major initiatives that we're looking at right now."

And what we're starting to see is, in Q1, for example, we're starting to see more RFPs. We're starting to see more demos, and we're actually -- some of the awards that we've gotten in Q1 that are not signed are actually starting to skew even heavily -- more heavily towards SaaS. As you know, we don't normally talk about unsigned awards. We talked last year about how COVID was impacting different parts of our business differently. And we saw a little bit greater impact, say, more on the high-end financials, where Munis is -- where a lot of our license sales are. And what we've seen so far in Q1 actually is that the awards that we're getting and the deals that are coming in are skewing at 80-plus percent to SaaS right now.

As Lynn said, we saw these pauses in procurement processes in second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, even to the fourth quarter of last year, where RFP volumes were down. Our clients were adapting to remote work. We weren't able to do in-person demos. And some clients wanted to see -- it took them a little while longer to adapt to doing a lot of those things remotely. So there were these pauses and delays in sales processes, particularly early-stage sales processes last year. And given our normal sales cycles that are 9 months to a year in typical deals, we expect that would show up in bookings now as we move into the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year, delays. And so really, our pipeline is still very robust.
The RFP activity is picking up. So as we've said all along, it's really a matter of timing. We haven't seen deals go away. We've just seen the timing pushed out. And it's not surprising that it's showing up. And given that more of the deals are skewing towards subscription, it's more evident in the lower subscription bookings than in the license deals."

Some of our conversations, there's still, I guess, there's still some uncertainty about how exactly this is going to be spent. One area, in particular, where we're hearing it's greenlighted in schools, and that's, I think, a noisier market than it's been in the past, but I know you mentioned you guys have 2,000 customers there, ReadySub tuck-ins, seems like it's really perfectly timed just as -- that was a nightmare to manage through COVID.

We talked about it last year, how, again, the impact of COVID did impact different parts of our business differently. While we had certain areas of our business, I just mentioned the higher-end ERP, schools was an area that was definitely impacted a lot. And our business in schools was off last year. At the same time, I also mentioned last quarter that last year was a record sales year in our courts business. So it's a little bit of a -- it's just different across our business. You're right, the American Rescue Plan, I do expect there are some money that's specifically targeted for K-12 and higher education. I think there's about $160 million, $170 million targeted for that. And I think what we're starting to see generally is just the more receptiveness from our clients in the schools area in terms of getting RFPs out in terms of talking about deals. There was -- I'd say there was an area last year where it was, I wouldn't say, silent, but it was certainly muted a little bit, and that's certainly coming back.
And to your point about ReadySub, you're right. That's a really exciting opportunity for us. It's kind of a small deal. And it's a deal that's not just -- it's a substitute teacher application that can go in. It's also becoming more -- that type of application is becoming more and more of a requirement in our ERP space for schools. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have over 2,000 school clients. And right now, that application is only in about 20 of them. And it's sort of the same playbook we had several years ago we did the ExecuTime acquisition. We expect that we're going to be able to grow that product pretty well, and it will be great for our inside sales channels as well as new business."

Typically, you will see the public sector change and evolve more slowly than the private sector. So often those things that -- those trends that start in the private sector take a little bit longer to take hold in the public sector. But just like the private sector, our clients have had to move to doing things remotely. And that is, I think, a significant factor in their ongoing preference in new systems for the cloud and in the conversions from on-premise customers accelerating. Courts is a great example where courthouses were physically closed and many of them still remain closed, but courts are an essential function. And so many courts that didn't have the ability to operate their systems remote or just shut down. And we have products, for example, our virtual courts product, that we accelerated, bringing to market early last year that enabled courts to continue to operate remotely. Licensing and permitting functions where clients have old legacy -- or not our clients, but public sector agencies, have old legacy systems that don't allow for remote access. So you don't have people in the office processing building permits and those sorts of things that are slowing down activity. Our systems provide for that remote access, and there's certainly an accelerated interest in those. So I think, yes, governments will, like the private sector, over time, look to work more remotely. And also, that's a factor with NIC, the ability to interact with government and make payments remotely or online rather than coming to a government office. And as we've talked about their first quarter results, we're certainly seeing that increase in volumes as a result of that trend."

So again, we're starting to see that increase in activity, those RFPs starting to pick up again and some of those deals moving forward. So we do believe there's a catch-up. It's just a matter of timing. We -- as we've said before, we also believe that, further down the road, that the -- there will be some procurements that will be accelerated that might have been -- clients might have thought they had years left in existing legacy systems and the need for remote access, security concerns around some of those legacy systems will be factors that will cause them to rethink that and accelerate the replacement of those systems. They'll still need to go through buying processes. They'll still need to budget those, but we do believe that there'll be a longer-term acceleration, but that the sort of pent-up demand in the current pipeline that there will be an acceleration as that works its way out.

But they're off to a strong start. As we said, overall, 10% -- a little above 10% growth in their core revenues. They actually, on the COVID-related revenues, significantly exceeded their plan on those, but we do expect those to wind down and not really be much of a factor after the second quarter. So their growth rate is a bit ahead of ours. And we talked about some of the strengths in their business from taking advantage of the increased desire of individuals and businesses to interact with governments digitally rather than in person. So generally, they have a positive outlook on the year. And within the next few weeks, we expect to have that combined guidance out and be able to talk more about the plans for working together through this year."

But it was because of that conservative approach, we're just not quite there yet. And the way I view it is we -- you know Tyler very well. You follow us a long time. We're always interested in the long term. And the thought of even potentially jeopardizing or delaying that deal by getting a few weeks head start on some of the stuff, it just didn't seem worth it. But it is a top priority. I think we'll get those numbers out, as Brian said, in about a month. But we know that it's going to be accretive to earnings. We know it's going to accretive to EBITDA and all the things we mentioned before and the excitement there.

And so I would expect that we'll be a little more -- we may have a little bit higher bar going forward in the short term on that. And as it relates to share repurchases, again, we're opportunistic. We're very comfortable with our debt leverage right now. One of the things I talked about at the last quarter -- the last call was we want to make sure we retain flexibility. And I think we have that flexibility. And our combined cash flow, if we did solely dedicate it to debt, it would be paid off in fairly short order. But I always want to maintain the flexibility to invest in the business when it makes sense, to do acquisitions when they make sense and to do share repurchase when they make sense.

And we really look forward to seeing how we can use the NIC payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that.

One of the most exciting opportunities, I think, with NIC as well is the opportunity for Socrata. Socrata had a lot of state and federal customers on their own before they came to Tyler. And with Tyler, we've been focusing on driving that more at the local level. And there's a lot of interest at NIC. I mentioned earlier about our management team's meeting earlier this week. And one of the big topics of conversation with Socrata and the excitement around what they can do and push data insights at all the various state agency levels. And so I think the outlook there is pretty good. I don't know that I've seen anything specific about a competitor that's anything new or different. Socrata has done a number of things in the pandemic, which has been helpful, but also there's been times we talk about delays. It's also been some issues in Socrata.

Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021. Recurring revenues, which comprised 75% of our first quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. 
A favorable revenue mix with strong subscription growth, coupled with cost efficiencies, drove a 270 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.8%. Cash flow continued to be very robust as cash from operations grew 26% and free cash flow grew almost 34%. 
We're pleased to see signs of growing activity in our public sector markets and expect that federal stimulus under the American Rescue Plan Act will have a positive impact on government technology spending going forward. Bookings in the first quarter were solid at approximately $247 million, but were down 22.8% against a very challenging comparison with the first quarter of 2020. 
Our largest deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement for our Munis ERP solution with the City of Fresno, California valued at approximately $10 million. Other significant SaaS contracts included ERP deals with Hall County, Georgia and Fort Smith, Arkansas and Odyssey Courts deal with Val Verde County, Texas. 
Our largest on-premises contracts include an ExecuTime time contract with the U.S. Virgin Islands, public safety and Brazos citations contracts with Montgomery County, New York and Cicero, Illinois and an EnerGov contract with the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. 
So far this year, we've been busy on the M&A front. On March 31, we completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions, DataSpec and ReadySub, for a total purchase price of $12 million in cash. DataSpec is a market-leading provider of software for the electronic management of veterans claims. DataSpec's web-based Software-as-a-Service system called VetraSpec allows for secure electronic claims submission to the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs and reporting capabilities in addition to scheduling, calendaring and payments. DataSpec offers county, state and national versions of VetraSpec, with state solutions making a majority of its implementations. The solution allows state departments to execute and analyze reports on the entire state, individual offices, regions and districts and individual users.  
ReadySub is a cloud-based platform that delivers comprehensive absence and substitute teacher management solutions, serving approximately 1,000 school districts across the United States, with only approximately 20 of which overlapping with Tyler's 2,000 school district clients. The solution helps districts with the labor-intensive and demanding task of filling both planned and unplanned staff absences with the most highly qualified substitute resources. With continuous pressure due to substitute teacher shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, districts can more easily retain a pool of qualified substitutes and automate the searching and filing of needed substitute spots. Additionally, ReadySub can integrate districts' payroll processes, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining related payroll tasks.  
Most importantly, last week, we completed the $2.3 billion cash acquisition of NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payments company that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. 
In addition, NIC has extensive experience and expertise and scale in the government payments area, processing more than $24 billion in payments on behalf of citizens and governments last year, which will accelerate Tyler's strategic payments initiative. With the addition of NIC's highly complementary industry-leading digital government solutions and payment services to Tyler's broad client base and multiple sales channels, the combined company will be well equipped to address the tremendous demand at the federal, state and local levels for innovative platform services. Together, Tyler and NIC will connect data and processes across disparate systems and deliver essential products and services to all public sector stakeholders. 
NIC had revenues of $460.5 million and net income of $68.6 million in 2020. While NIC will cease to be an SEC reporting company and, therefore, will not issue a first quarter earnings release, they also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plan. NIC's core first quarter revenues, excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives that are expected to wind down after the second quarter, grew more than 10% over last year. 
In addition, NIC's operating income, again excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives as well as acquisition costs, rose more than 20%. We are thrilled to welcome the more than 1,000 talented employees of NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub to the Tyler family and look forward to realizing the tremendous benefits these transactions can bring to our collective team members and clients and to Tyler shareholders. 
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $294.8 million, up 6.6% on a GAAP basis and 6.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As you may recall, we were off to a very strong start in the first 2 months of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly affect our business in March. So we're generally pleased with our growth this quarter against that comparison. 
Software license revenues declined 20.3%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a high mix of subscription deals at 66% of new software contract value. Software services revenue declined 8.6% as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our shift to remote delivery of most services resulted in a decline in billable travel revenue. 
On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 25.4%. We added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 39 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $98 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 66% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 73% in Q1 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.0 years, compared to 5.9 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $26.9 million, up 22.4%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.6 million, up 4.8%, and e-payments revenue of $11.3 million, up 59.3%.
For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $886 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $302 million, up 26.3%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $108 million, up 22.4%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $476 million, up 4.1%.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.55 billion, up 3%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were solid at $247 million. However, this was down 22.8% compared to a difficult comparison to Q1 of last year. Last year's first quarter bookings included several large contracts, including 2 significant follow-on SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $38 million. 
For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, down 13.3%, although they do not include the majority of the $98 million extension of our Texas e-filing contract signed in Q4 of 2020 because of certain termination provisions in that contract. If the Texas e-filing renewal was fully included, trailing 12-month bookings would have been down only 6.4%. The prior trailing 12-month bookings also included 4 significant SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $123 million. The bookings growth rate in Q1 was also affected by a shorter average term for new subscription contracts. Our subscription -- software subscription booking in the first quarter added $10.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. 
Cash flow was once again very strong in the first quarter as cash from operations increased 26.4% to $71.7 million and free cash flow grew 33.9% to $61.7 million, representing an all-time high for first quarter free cash flow.    
We financed the NIC acquisition with a mixture of debt at very attractive rates that gives us a flexible capital structure. In March, we completed a $600 million offering of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026. The notes are convertible into Tyler common stock at a conversion price of $493.44, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price on March 4. On April 21, concurrent with the closing of the NIC acquisition, we entered into a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility with a group of 8 banks. The facility includes a $300 million term note due in 2024 and a $600 million term note due in 2026, both of which can be prepaid without penalty. The facility also includes a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit agreement that replaces our prior $400 million revolver. The combination of the convertible debt, term notes and revolver provide us with a great deal of flexibility. Our balance sheet remains very strong and its pro forma net leverage at the NIC closing was approximately 3.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year with net leverage under 2.5x. The current blended interest rate on the $1.75 billion of debt we have outstanding today is 1.1%. 
We remain on track to achieve or exceed the annual revenue and EPS guidance that we communicated in February for Tyler, excluding the impact of the NIC acquisition. As Lynn mentioned, NIC also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plans. We expect the NIC acquisition will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in 2021. Because of antitrust restrictions, we took a conservative approach to our integration and strategic planning for NIC prior to closing the transaction last week. We are currently working closely with NIC's leadership to evaluate strategic growth opportunities that take advantage of the combined strength of the 2 businesses and determine the impact on our 2021 plan. We expect to complete the fine-tuning of our joint operating and financial plans for the remainder of the year and issue 2021 guidance for the combined company during the second quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn."

Our team of professionals, including our new NIC team members, executed at a high level in the first quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations for both Tyler and NIC and provided a great start to 2021. Exiting 2020, our financial position was stronger than ever, allowing us to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, including NIC, the largest acquisition in our history with a purchase price of $2.3 billion in cash. We've also been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe we will continue to see an acceleration of the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. 
I'm happy to say that we are on track with the strategic investments in optimizing our products for the cloud that we discussed on our fourth quarter call. 
This quarter, we saw early indicators that our market is beginning to recover as some delayed procurement processes are moving forward and RFP activity is growing from the levels of the second half of 2020. We also expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and have a positive impact on recovery of our markets. 
One topic I've not discussed on these calls before pertains to our efforts regarding environmental and social initiatives. Tyler's culture guides our commitment to being a responsible partner in the communities where we live, work and serve our clients. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Tyler Foundation, which since its creation has provided millions of dollars to charities and causes that positively impact our communities. 
Our culture is also the foundation for our belief in the importance of providing an inclusive and diverse workplace. We are proud to have been included in the Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity List for the past 2 consecutive years. 
The pause in normal office occupancy and business travel due to the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to evaluate our environmental impact across our major office locations and identify opportunities to make our practices more consistent and effective. Last year, we formed an environmental task force to strengthen our sustainability efforts across our office locations and the communities we impact. We achieved a significant milestone last year by responding to Tyler's first invitation to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index survey. More than 3,500 of the world's largest publicly listed companies provide detailed data and background to this global survey for evaluation by its independent sustainability ranking body. Completing the survey was an important opportunity for Tyler to uncover opportunities to strengthen our core responsibility strategy. 
We recently published our second annual corporate responsibility report, which is available on our website. This report represents a significant expansion of our reporting on our ESG efforts, and we look forward to continuing our journey and sharing our progress in this area. 
Finally, this week, we are virtually hosting more than 5,000 clients at Connect 2021, our annual user conference with a theme called Virtually Possible. Team members from across Tyler are providing nearly 700 hours of valuable content for our clients using our advanced virtual event platform. We are excited to be able to connect with so many clients at our virtual event, and we look forward to connecting with them in person at Connect 2022. 
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

And so I think what it's done is it's given our clients a little bit more confidence. I don't know that I would say it necessarily benefits one more than the other. Although one thing that we were noticing last year was in our state business and that -- our state business was off quite a bit last year, and there was a little bit of uncertainty around there. As it turns out, a lot of the state budgets were not as impacted as they first thought a year ago. And so I think the combination of that, along with this American Rescue Plan funding, is providing a boost in that state area. We're starting to see that with some of the RFPs and things that we knew that were intended to come out that got delayed, and we're starting to see some of that. But I'd say, across our entire product lines, I think there's reason for I'd call cautious optimism in what's going on in the markets, and a big part of that is the American Rescue Plan."

And there are very few restrictions on what it can be used for. The funding is just now becoming available to governments. Half of it available roughly now within 60 days of when it was passed. And then the other half is available 12 months from now. So we wouldn't have expected to see much impact on customers' purchasing activities and buying decisions yet, but it certainly points to an opportunity as we move through the year to provide significant relief."

As we mentioned in our comments, we're really just now beginning to sort of dig deep into our integration efforts and our strategic initiatives. And in fact, this week, we had the senior executives of both companies meeting face to face for the first time, which was exciting, and really started brainstorming. And at a high level, we already know sort of some of the major initiatives that we want to take on. And the good news is there's a lot of initiatives. And one thing that we need to do and be careful about is make sure that we prioritize them, look at some of the low-hanging fruit and look at some of the things that will have the most impact. 
You mentioned payments. That certainly is one of our largest initiatives. From a technical standpoint, there's still a little bit of work to do there. But NIC is the unquestioned leader in payments in the public sector at the state level, and it's a growing thing for us. What we see there is the ability to leverage our client base and get payments more at the local level and leverage their technical experience to help boost our payments, talked about other sort of integrations and things. We talked before about their state enterprise contracts, which provide sort of hunting licenses. And in fact, it's those state contracts, which they classify as state enterprise revenues, where they go in and then they sort of -- they plant a seed and then they're able to go build additional revenues from there. On their own, this first quarter, their -- those revenues were up 20%, which is pretty exciting. And then what we start talking about is what kind of products do we have at Tyler that we can really just go in and push there. And I don't think there's a lot of technical integration there that's going to need to be done. But that's another one of our major initiatives that we're looking at right now."

And what we're starting to see is, in Q1, for example, we're starting to see more RFPs, we're starting to see more demos, and we're actually -- some of the awards that we've gotten in Q1 that are not signed are actually starting to skew even heavily -- more heavily towards SaaS. As you know, we don't normally talk about unsigned awards. We talked last year about how COVID was impacting different parts of our business differently. And we saw a little bit greater impact, say, more on the high-end financials, where Munis is -- where a lot of our license sales are. And what we've seen so far in Q1, actually, is that the awards that we're getting and the deals that are coming in are skewing at 80-plus percent to SaaS right now. So I think that overall trend that we've talked about is still going on. There's just a little bit of lumpiness and a little bit of hangover still from COVID."

As Lynn said, we saw these pauses in procurement processes in second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, even to the fourth quarter of last year, where RFP volumes were down. Our clients were adapting to remote work. We weren't able to do in-person demos and some clients wanted to see -- it took them a little while longer to adapt to doing a lot of those things remotely. So there were these pauses and delays in sales processes, particularly early-stage sales processes last year. 
And given our normal sales cycles that are 9 months to 1 year in typical deals, we expect that would show up in bookings now as we move into the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year, these delays. And so, really, our pipeline is still very robust. 
The RFP activity is picking up. So as we've said all along, it's really a matter of timing. We haven't seen deals go away. We've just seen the timing pushed out, and it's not surprising that it's showing up. And given that more of the deals are skewing towards subscription, it's more evident in the lower subscription bookings than in the license deals."

At the same time, I also mentioned last quarter that last year was a record sales year in our courts business. So it's a little bit of a -- it's just different across our business. You're right, the American Rescue Plan, I do expect there are some money that's specifically targeted for K-12 and higher education. I think there's about $160 million, $170 million targeted for that. And I think what we're starting to see, generally, is just the more receptiveness from our clients in the schools area in terms of getting RFPs out, in terms of talking about deals. There was -- I'd say there was an area last year where it was, I wouldn't say silenced, but it was certainly muted a little bit, and that's certainly coming back. 
And to your point about ReadySub, you're right. That's a really exciting opportunity for us. It's kind of a small deal. And it's a deal that's not just -- you want substitute teacher application that can go in. It's also becoming more -- that type of application is becoming more and more of a requirement in our ERP space for schools. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have over 2,000 school clients. And right now, that application is only in about 20 of them. And it's sort of the same playbook we had.

Typically, you will see the public sector change and evolve more slowly than the private sector. So often those things that -- those trends that start in the private sector take a little bit longer to take hold in the public sector. But just like the private sector, our clients have had to move to doing things remotely. And that is, I think, a significant factor in their ongoing preference in new systems for the cloud and in the conversions from on-premise customers accelerating. 
Courts is a great example where courthouses were physically closed and many of them still remain closed, but courts are an essential function. And so many courts that didn't have the ability to operate their systems remote were just shut down. And we have products, for example, our virtual courts product, that we accelerated, bringing to market early last year that enabled courts to continue to operate remotely, licensing and permitting functions where clients have old legacy -- not our clients, but public sector agencies have old legacy systems that don't allow for remote access. So you don't have people in the office processing building permits and those sorts of things that are slowing down activity. Our systems provide for that remote access, and there's certainly an accelerated interest in those. 
So I think, yes, governments will, like the private sector, over time, look to work more remotely. And also, that's a factor with NIC, the ability to interact with government and make payments remotely or online rather than coming to a government office. And as we've talked about their first quarter results, we're certainly seeing that increase in volumes as a result of that trend."

So really, right now, we're comparing against what was not only the last sort of pre-pandemic or pre-affected quarter, unaffected quarter, but also what was just a very strong quarter with some large deals in it. 
We do think there would be a catch-up. It's not likely to be sort of a dramatic one quarter kind of a catch-up, but the combination of, one, the fact that these are essential systems and that the pipeline -- they remain in the pipeline, the timing has just been pushed out. So again, we're starting to see that increase in activity, those RFPs starting to pick up again and some of those deals moving forward. So we do believe there's a catch-up. It is just a matter of timing. 
We -- as we've said before, we also believe that, further down the road, that the -- there will be some procurements that will be accelerated that might have been -- clients might have thought they had years left in existing legacy systems and the need for remote access, security concerns around some of those legacy systems will be factors that will cause them to rethink that and accelerate the replacement of those systems. They'll still need to go through buying processes. They'll still need to budget those, but we do believe that there'll be a longer-term acceleration, but that the sort of pent-up demand in the current pipeline, that there will be an acceleration as that works its way out.

And even while in the last 6, 9 months, the markets have been off a little bit, our actual win rates have actually been climbing. And so our competitive position continues to grow. And as we look at bookings, we've talked about this a lot over the years, we have a pretty steady stream, but it's always -- there can always be some large skews in various quarters because we do have parts of our business that get some really large deals. Last year, we were a little concerned about Q2 of last year because Q2 of '19, we had, I think, one of our largest deals in Tyler's history. And so that's kind of what we're competing against.

And again, it's not just the opportunity of rolling out through our inside sales, but it will also help our competitiveness on new deals in the schools market as it's becoming more and more of a requirement.  
DataSpec, I would classify it as a little bit more of a consolidation play. They were probably the leader in the veterans benefits application space. They had 32 state customers.

But they're off to a strong start. As we said, overall, 10% -- a little above 10% growth in their core revenues. They actually, on the COVID-related revenues, significantly exceeded their plan on those, but we do expect those to wind down and not really be much of a factor after the second quarter.

And so I would expect that we'll be a little more -- we may have a little bit higher bar, going forward, in the short term on that. 
And as it relates to share repurchases, again, we're opportunistic. We're very comfortable with our debt leverage right now. One of the things I talked about at the last quarter -- the last call was we want to make sure we retain flexibility. And I think we have that flexibility. And our combined cash flow, if we did solely dedicate it to debt, it would be paid off in fairly short order. But I always want to maintain the flexibility to invest in the business when it makes sense, to do acquisitions when they make sense and to do share repurchase when they make sense. And we've got that. And so you'll see us pay down that debt in a fairly aggressive manner, but we're going to have that flexibility, and we'll always have that flexibility."

They just go in as those revenues flow through our income statement because there's not a fixed amount. It's really just our fixed fee e-filing that goes into booking, other than in the case of the Texas renewal.

I think our e-filing revenues were up sort of mid-single digits. But as courts open back up, we would expect to see volumes pick back up there in that transaction-based business. That does typically have a payments component. 
But we've talked about our own payment initiatives over the last few quarters and how we are starting to -- with a sort of a newly refined go-to-market strategy, we are trying to push our payments platform into more of our customers, so increase the adoption. And we're certainly seeing increased adoption among  their citizens in making payments online. We're adding new customers, and we're bringing in more payment types with those customers that do have our payments platform. So we're still in the early stages within the Tyler business of performing against that strategic objective of significantly increasing our payments business. And we really look forward to seeing how we can use the NIC payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that. But the business on its own is doing well within Tyler, and it's had really strong growth over the last couple of years. But again, still off a much smaller base than NIC has."

One of the most exciting opportunities, I think, with NIC as well is the opportunity for Socrata. Socrata had a lot of state and federal customers on their own before they came to Tyler. And with Tyler, we've been focusing on driving that more at the local level. 
And there's a lot of interest at NIC. I mentioned earlier about our management team's meeting earlier this week. And one of the big topics of conversation with Socrata and the excitement around what they can do and push data insights at all the various state agency levels. And so I think the outlook there is pretty good. I don't know that I've seen anything specific about a competitor that's anything new or different. Socrata has done a number of things in the pandemic, which has been helpful, but also there's been times -- we talked about delays. It's also been some issues in Socrata. I felt the same thing the rest of our business has and has not grown quite as fast in the last years as we may have anticipated. But the future of Socrata within Tyler and our Connected Communities visions and what we're trying to do, which, again, I don't know that any other company has the ability to do it. It's an important piece of that, and it's something that provides a lot of excitement both within our clients as well as within Tyler. So it's -- yes, it's doing well."

First, I want to provide you with an update on the NIC acquisition and our progress in the first 3 months post closing, and then we'll move on to a review of the quarter's results. 
As you know, we completed the acquisition of NIC during the second quarter on April 21st. With a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, this was by far our largest acquisition to date and our first acquisition of a public company. NIC is a leading provider of digital government solutions and payment processing that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. We believe that the combination of NIC and Tyler provides tremendous opportunities for incremental growth in both businesses. 
The combined company is the public sector market leader for payment solutions and we plan to use NIC's robust payment platform to expand our local government payments business. We also have an opportunity to leverage NIC's strong relationships and state enterprise contracts to deliver Tyler solutions at the state level, including our MicroPact and entellitrak platform. We discussed our vision for those opportunities on our investor call in early June. 
I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made toward these objectives in the 3 months that NIC has been a part of Tyler. Our teams have prioritized our opportunities and are very engaged, working well together in a regular cadence. Our pre-acquisition impressions regarding the high degree of compatibility between the cultures of the 2 organizations have thus far proven to be accurate and leaders in both organizations have commented on how natural the combination feels. 
Our payments teams are working together and have been very encouraged as we learn more about each company's strengths and how complementary they are. As we noted on our June call, the state of Florida is a great example of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing. NIC is in the process of implementing a statewide payment processing solution for the state government in Florida. And the contract allows for local governments in the state, more than 400 of which are Tyler clients, to piggyback on that contract and we are actively pursuing those opportunities. 
For the last 2 months, we've also been conducting weekly showcases to familiarize NIC state enterprise managers with Tyler's broad portfolio of solutions and to surface opportunities in their states. We have already developed a growing joint pipeline that is generating active engagements with prospects in NIC states. 
And finally, our teams are actively working together to jointly establish the data and analytics platform for Connected Communities, leveraging our respective strengths, including our Socrata Data & Insights platform and NIC's Gov2Go Citizen portal. Together, NIC and Tyler can now provide the most expansive set of capabilities for citizens to interact with government at all levels. 
Turning to the quarter. NIC, like Tyler, had a very strong second quarter as they continue to benefit from the recovery from the pandemic with a growing demand for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with government. NIC also recorded higher than expected revenues from its tour health and pandemic unemployment initiatives, although those lower-margin revenues are currently expected to taper off in the second half of the year. Although NIC's results are only included in Tyler's consolidated financials from the date of the acquisition on April 21st, for the full quarter, NIC's core revenues, excluding revenues from Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Initiatives, grew 23.5%. 
We're also very pleased to report that in late June, NIC was selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution, which will allow individual and business taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes. The contract has an initial 6-month term with 4 1-year renewal options and revenue under the contract is expected to begin in January of 2022. The actual revenue will be driven by the number of taxpayers who choose to pay online and who choose to use the NIC platform, and we expect to aggressively market our solution. 
We currently estimate annual gross revenue under the contract to be between $40 million and $60 million with annual net revenue of $5 million to $7 million after interchange and merchant fees. This contract significantly expands NIC's payment processing at the federal level and underscores the strength of NIC's platform and leadership in public sector payments. 
Moving on to our consolidated results. Our second quarter was very strong, reflecting the inclusion of the results of NIC from April 21 with both core Tyler and NIC operations exceeding expectations. Total revenues grew 49.1% driven by the inclusion of NIC, as well as the acceleration of Tyler's organic growth to 12.4%. Recurring revenues comprised 79% of our second quarter revenues and were led by 133% growth in subscription revenues with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 24%. 
Software licenses and services revenues also rebounded from the low point in last year's second quarter, growing 17% or 7.6% excluding NIC. As expected, our margins were down compared to second quarter last year as some costs and lower margin revenues, like billable travel, that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic began to return. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID-related revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points to 26.5%. 
Bookings in the second quarter grew 50% to approximately $464 million with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC, bookings rose 17.5%. Our largest deal in the quarter was a combination license and SaaS arrangement with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies valued at approximately $9.3 million for our entellitrak regulatory, Socrata Data & Insights, and SceneDoc Mobile Field Inspection Solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. And all those solutions will be hosted in AWS. 
This deal is a great example of our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler products, many of which came from recent acquisitions, into a single deal, enhancing the competitiveness of solutions like entellitrak. We also signed a large public safety license contract with the Lake County Sheriffs office in Illinois for our CAD, RMS, Mobile, Field Reporting, Brazos e-citation, Soft Code Process Service and Socrata Data & Insight solutions valued at approximately $4.1 million. 
In addition, we signed 4 other license deals across multiple product suites, each with contract values greater than $1 million. SaaS contracts represented 65% of our new contract software value in the second quarter. Our largest SaaS contract was a 5-year deal with Dubuque, Iowa, for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services Solutions valued at approximately $4.6 million. We also signed SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Charles County, Maryland, valued at approximately $4 million; and DeSoto, Texas valued at approximately $3.5 million. 
We also signed a SaaS deal for our Tyler Supervision Solution with Riverside County, California, valued at approximately $3.3 million. This is the largest deal to date for our Supervision product, which came to Tyler through the acquisition of CaseloadPRO a little less than 3 years ago. And in fact, the value of the single contract is greater than the total annual revenues of that business when we acquired it. 
In addition, we signed 9 other SaaS arrangements during the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million. In addition to the IRS payment processing contract, during the second quarter, NIC signed extensions of its state enterprise contracts for digital government and payment processing services with the states of Oregon and Idaho. NIC also signed a 5-year SaaS agreement for its RXGov prescription drug monitoring program solution with the province of New Brunswick, Canada, marking the first international deployment for that solution. 
We're pleased to see the increased market activity and trends that reflect our markets are rebounding back toward pre-COVID levels. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter."

Note that the results of DataSpec and ReadySub, which were acquired on March 31st, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and the results of NIC are included in our results from the date of acquisition, April 21st.
In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
GAAP revenues for the quarter were $404.1 million, up 49.1%. Non-GAAP revenues were $405.4 million, up 49.4%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 3.4%. Subscription revenues rose 133%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 24%. We added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 62 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. 
In Q2 of last year, we added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and had 42 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 65% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 43% in Q2 of last year as we continued our shift to a cloud-first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.1 years compared to 3.7 last year. 
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal revenues, payment processing and e-filing are included in subscriptions and are included in subscriptions were $119.6 million, up 463%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $16.3 million, up 14.5%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.1%. For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.3 billion, up 58.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q2 was approximately $325 million, up 25.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $479 million, up 463% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $478 million, up 2.4%. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.63 billion, up 5.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $21 million. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $464 million, up 50.1% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $364 million, up 17.5%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 9.6%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.2 billion, up 1.3%. 
Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $15 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both negative in the second quarter as Q2 included approximately $19 million of acquisition-related costs. In addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections by NIC on behalf of government agencies prior to the close of the acquisition and remittances to the agencies post acquisition. This is purely a timing difference and will normalize in future quarters. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we paid down $185 million of the debt incurred under our revolver in connection with the acquisition. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.565 billion and cash and investments of $380.9 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repaid an additional $52 million on the revolver. And today, we have outstanding $1.513 billion of debt with a blended stated interest rate of 1.01%. 
We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year of 2021, which is as follows. We expect 2021 GAAP total revenues will be between $1.532 billion and $1.557 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.535 billion and $1.560 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $32 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are not expected to recur in future years. 
We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.68 and $3.81 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.70 and $6.80. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $23 million and includes approximately $11 million of amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. 
For the year, pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $102 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $94 million and $96 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42 million and 42.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 2% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $46 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. 
Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2021 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $22 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $126 million, including approximately $89 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

As you can see, our team of professionals, including our new team members at NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub, executed at a very high level in the second quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations. As I've said before, I'm extremely proud of how our team members have responded to the challenges in the last 1.5 years with incredible grit, grace and resilience. And we're proud that Tyler has recently been named a Best Place to Work by publications in Washington, D.C., Colorado and Mississippi, joining several other locations where Tyler has received similar awards. 
We've continued to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach with a focus on optimizing our products for the cloud and transitioning SaaS deployments from Tyler data centers to AWS. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We continue to see indications that our market is returning to normal, as many delayed procurement processes are moving forward and new processes are starting. RFPs and sales activities such as demos are trending toward, and in some cases, exceeding pre-COVID levels. 
While not a significant factor in Q2, we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A."

I mean, in some parts of our business really to pre-COVID levels, some just almost getting back to pre-COVID levels. 
I think a function of that, too, is just the general sentiment and mood out there. I think the American Rescue Plan provides that confidence. We're also, as you know, most of our clients are now in a new budget year. And I think with those expectations for more funding, they saw the real impact to their budgets from last year were not as severe. And I think just -- I think some of that's coming back. And I think you've just also highlight what we've talked about throughout the last 1.5 years is that the demand for what we do doesn't go away. It's going to be pent-up. And so we're starting to see that. So at a high level, that's what I'd say.

The first question is on just general deal flow from the core Tyler side when you talked about how things seem to be normalizing more towards prepandemic levels, the volume of deal flow certainly speaks to that in the quarter.

And then my second question, Brian, is on your guidance for the year. The non, I guess, ongoing revenues from the Tour Health and the pandemic side from NIC was increased from $21 million to $32 million for the year.

Our unsigned selections, which we don't talk about a lot. Those are up significantly. The number of new deals, as you pointed out, that we signed this quarter was, I think, up over 30% from a year ago. When you look at areas like where -- I talked about the last few quarters, where we saw a little bit more slowdown was more in our high-end financials, our Munis and our EnerGov solutions. 
We're certainly seeing the momentum growing there. I think Q4 was probably a low in those areas for RFPs and selections. And those are up significantly. And remember, those types of deals, they generally take about 3 quarters from RFP to close. So there will continue to be a lag as we're seeing these RFPs come up, but that's continuing other places like our lower-end financials, our in code. I think RFPs now are actually back to 2019 levels. So it's there. It's a combination of pent-up demand, but also just the market returning."

And so having them part of that is, as you say, it's a nice round out. It also -- I think it highlights -- when we talk about a lot of these large deals, and I mentioned it in my remarks. And it really highlights the value of our acquisition strategy over the years. I mean, when you talk about -- that's a deal that -- it's our largest deal of the quarter. Well, that's our entellitrak that came from MicroPact. It includes Socrata, another recent acquisition, SceneDoc, the NIC payments. It includes our strategic alliance with AWS. It is kind of a showcase deal for the quarter. And again, I think, validates our acquisition strategy and how it plays in the market even as it may take time for us to sort of build up and get these larger contracts that really put us in a competitive position that makes it difficult for others to compete with."

But you're right, beyond payments, we talk about that a lot. But one of the things that makes us really excited is the ability to sell Tyler products through those state contracts and really leverage those NIC relationships. 
I mean, they've got very deep relationships at the highest levels of state government areas where really Tyler just didn't have access. And I'm talking about governors and senior decision makers and you get in front of those people and we're able to get in front of those people and try to talk to them about what are you guys trying to get done, what policies are you pursuing, and whether it's economic development or HHS or prison reform or whatever it is, and we've got the solutions to do it. And that's really the crux of what we're doing with these weekly showcases with Tyler products. We have to educate all of these state the state GMs and the entire NIC executive team as to what our portfolio is really all about and how we can leverage that. And I don't want to minimize that because we talk a lot about payments, but that is something that we see as significant upside."

Our customers are starting to want to see our salespeople and our implementation people in some instances back on site, and we still expect that we'll continue in most cases to deliver the majority of our implementation services remotely. There is a desire in an increasing number of customers to see people back on site. And so that's picked up even a little bit sooner than we expected. But certainly well under half of what it was pre-COVID. 
Public safety is probably one of those areas because the -- our clients never went home. The first responders and -- those agencies continue to work, and so they're ready to have us back on site as well. So we're seeing a bit of that come back, but still well under the pre-COVID levels."

I mean those contracts that NIC has done an amazing job over the years. It takes them a little bit longer, but really of establishing contracts that are extremely open-ended and as we like to use the term hunting license. And so it allows those -- under those contracts to pursue a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different agencies and in some cases, even local jurisdictions. It allows them to push products. But more importantly, too, it also -- what they also bring is, as I just mentioned, is their deep relationships with different agencies and different higher execs at the state level, areas that where Tyler just didn't have any exposure. 
And so it's leveraging those relationships, leveraging Tyler's products, leveraging those open-ended contracts really creates a whole new opportunity for Tyler that we've never seen before. An example would be we're having discussions with a particular state with some court solutions. And we're actually able to have conversations at an extremely high level at a place where Tyler traditionally just had not been able to do it. And those relationships are coming from those state contracts. And I mentioned the state of Oregon and the State of Idaho as renewals for NIC. And what's important there is the Oregon contract, that's an extension, but that's an extension of a 10-year relationship. The Idaho contract is a 2-year extension on a 22-year relationship. So these are very deep relationships that NIC has done. Getting these renewals is something you don't take for granted, and you've got to continue to deliver value. And I think the flip side of that is what Tyler can bring is, as we continue to leverage those relationships and put more products, it will actually bring that more value to those contracts and further deepen those relationships so that those will continue to sustain and survive well into the future."

First, I want to provide you with an update on the NIC acquisition and our progress in the first 3 months post closing, and then we'll move on to a review of the quarter's results.
As you know, we completed the acquisition of NIC during the second quarter on April 21. With a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, this was by far our largest acquisition to date and our first acquisition of a public company. NIC is a leading provider of digital government solutions and payment processing that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. We believe that the combination of NIC and Tyler provides tremendous opportunities for incremental growth in both businesses.
The combined company is the public sector market leader for payment solutions and we plan to use NIC's robust payment platform to expand our local government payments business. We also have an opportunity to leverage NIC's strong relationships and state enterprise contracts to deliver Tyler solutions at the state level, including our MicroPact entellitrak platform. We discussed our vision for those opportunities on our investor call in early June.
I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made toward these objectives in the 3 months that NIC has been a part of Tyler. Our teams have prioritized our opportunities and are very engaged, working well together in a regular cadence. Our pre-acquisition impressions regarding the high degree of compatibility between the cultures of the 2 organizations have thus far proven to be accurate and leaders in both organizations have commented on how natural the combination feels.
Our payments teams are working together and have been very encouraged as we learn more about each company's strengths and how complementary they are. As we noted on our June call, the state of Florida is a great example of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing. NIC is in the process of implementing a statewide payment processing solution for the state government in Florida. And the contract allows for local governments in the state, more than 400 of which are Tyler clients, to piggyback on that contract and we are actively pursuing those opportunities.
For the last 2 months, we've also been conducting weekly showcases to familiarize NIC state enterprise managers with Tyler's broad portfolio of solutions and to surface opportunities in their states. We have already developed a growing joint pipeline that is generating active engagements with prospects in NIC states.
And finally, our teams are actively working together to jointly establish the data and analytics platform for Connected Communities, leveraging our respective strengths, including our Socrata Data & Insights platform and NIC's Gov2Go citizen portal. Together, NIC and Tyler can now provide the most expansive set of capabilities for citizens to interact with government at all levels.
Turning to the quarter. NIC, like Tyler, had a very strong second quarter as they continue to benefit from the recovery from the pandemic with a growing demand for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with government. NIC also recorded higher than expected revenues from its TourHealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives, although those lower-margin revenues are currently expected to taper off in the second half of the year. Although NIC's results are only included in Tyler's consolidated financials from the date of the acquisition on April 21, for the full quarter, NIC's core revenues, excluding revenues from TourHealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives, grew 23.5%.
We're also very pleased to report that in late June, NIC was selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution, which will allow individual and business taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes. The contract has an initial 6-month term with 4 1-year renewal options and revenue under the contract is expected to begin in January of 2022. The actual revenue will be driven by the number of taxpayers who choose to pay online and who choose to use the NIC platform, and we expect to aggressively market our solution.
We currently estimate annual gross revenue under the contract to be between $40 million and $60 million with annual net revenue of $5 million to $7 million after interchange and merchant fees. This contract significantly expands NIC's payment processing at the federal level and underscores the strength of NIC's platform and leadership in public sector payments.
Moving on to our consolidated results. Our second quarter was very strong, reflecting the inclusion of the results of NIC from April 21 with both core Tyler and NIC operations exceeding expectations. Total revenues grew 49.1% driven by the inclusion of NIC, as well as the acceleration of Tyler's organic growth to 12.4%. Recurring revenues comprised 79% of our second quarter revenues and were led by 133% growth in subscription revenues with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 24%.  
Software licenses and services revenues also rebounded from the low point in last year's second quarter, growing 17% or 7.6% excluding NIC. As expected, our margins were down compared to second quarter last year as some costs and lower margin revenues, like billable travel, that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic began to return. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID-related revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points to 26.5%. Bookings in the second quarter grew 50% to approximately $464 million with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC, bookings rose 17.5%. 
Our largest deal in the quarter was a combination license and SaaS arrangement with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies valued at approximately $9.3 million for our entellitrak Regulatory, Socrata Data & Insights, and SceneDoc mobile field inspection solutions as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. And all those solutions will be hosted in AWS.
This deal is a great example of our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler products, many of which came from recent acquisitions, into a single deal, enhancing the competitiveness of solutions like entellitrak. We also signed a large public safety license contract with the Lake County Sheriff's Office in Illinois for our CAD, RMS, mobile, field reporting, Brazos eCitation, SoftCode process service and Socrata Data & Insight solutions valued at approximately $4.1 million.
In addition, we signed 4 other license deals across multiple product suites, each with contract values greater than $1 million. SaaS contracts represented 65% of our new contract software value in the second quarter. Our largest SaaS contract was a 5-year deal with Dubuque, Iowa, for our Munis ERP and EnerGov civic services solutions valued at approximately $4.6 million. We also signed SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Charles County, Maryland, valued at approximately $4 million and DeSoto, Texas, valued at approximately $3.5 million.
We also signed a SaaS deal for our Tyler Supervision solution with Riverside County, California, valued at approximately $3.3 million. This is the largest deal to date for our Supervision product, which came to Tyler through the acquisition of CaseloadPRO a little less than 3 years ago. And in fact, the value of the single contract is greater than the total annual revenues of that business when we acquired it.
In addition, we signed 9 other SaaS arrangements during the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million. In addition to the IRS payment processing contract, during the second quarter, NIC signed extensions of its state enterprise contracts for digital government and payment processing services with the states of Oregon and Idaho. NIC also signed a 5-year SaaS agreement for its RxGov prescription drug monitoring program solution with the province of New Brunswick, Canada, marking the first international deployment for that solution.
We're pleased to see the increased market activity and trends that reflect our markets are rebounding back toward pre-COVID levels. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. Note that the results of DataSpec and ReadySub, which were acquired on March 31, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and",936,"Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. Note that the results of DataSpec and ReadySub, which were acquired on March 31, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and the results of NIC are included in our results from the date of acquisition, April 21.
In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.
GAAP revenues for the quarter were $404.1 million, up 49.1%. Non-GAAP revenues were $405.4 million, up 49.4%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 3.4%. Subscription revenues rose 133%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 24%. We added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 62 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value.
In Q2 of last year, we added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and had 42 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 65% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 43% in Q2 of last year. As we continued our shift to a cloud-first approach to sales, the value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.1 years compared to 3.7 last year.
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal revenues, payment processing and e-filing are included in subscriptions -- and are included in subscriptions, were $119.6 million, up 463%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $16.3 million, up 14.5%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.1%. For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.3 billion, up 58.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q2 was approximately $325 million, up 25.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $479 million, up 463% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $478 million, up 2.4%.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.63 billion, up 5.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $21 million. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $464 million, up 50.1% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $364 million, up 17.5%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 9.6%, and on an organic basis were approximately $1.2 billion, up 1.3%.
Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $15 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both negative in the second quarter as Q2 included approximately $19 million of acquisition-related costs. In addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections by NIC on behalf of government agencies prior to the close of the acquisition and remittances to the agencies post acquisition. This is purely a timing difference and will normalize in future quarters.
Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we paid down $185 million of the debt incurred under our revolver in connection with the acquisition. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.565 billion and cash and investments of $380.9 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repaid an additional $52 million on the revolver. And today, we have outstanding $1.513 billion of debt with a blended stated interest rate of 1.01%.
We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year of 2021, which is as follows. We expect 2021 GAAP total revenues will be between $1.532 billion and $1.557 billion, and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.535 billion and $1.560 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $32 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic unemployment services that are not expected to recur in future years.
We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.68 and $3.81 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.70 and $6.80. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $23 million and includes approximately $11 million of amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs.
For the year, pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $102 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $94 million and $96 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42 million and 42.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 2% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $46 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises.
Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2021 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $22 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $126 million, including approximately $89 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

As you can see, our team of professionals, including our new team members at NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub, executed at a very high level in the second quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations. As I've said before, I'm extremely proud of how our team members have responded to the challenges in the last 1.5 years with incredible grit, grace and resilience. And we're proud that Tyler has recently been named a Best Place to Work by publications in Washington, D.C., Colorado and Mississippi, joining several other locations where Tyler has received similar awards.
We've continued to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate, all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach with a focus on optimizing our products for the cloud and transitioning SaaS deployments from Tyler data centers to AWS. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We continue to see indications that our market is returning to normal, as many delayed procurement processes are moving forward and new processes are starting. RFPs and sales activities such as demos are trending toward, and in some cases, exceeding pre-COVID levels.
While not a significant factor in Q2, we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid to schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

Congratulations on the IRS win. Just curious, the -- if I'm looking at it correctly, the annual guide, which you just gave in June, but it didn't go up as much as the relative beat in the quarter.

So that's part of the factor around the second quarter outperforming on the revenue side, but not expecting to see that same bump in the second half of the year.

I think when -- you're seeing the more releases in RFPs, the things that we're seeing in the market, the more demos, the activity picking up, I mean, in some parts of our business really to pre-COVID levels, some just almost getting back to pre-COVID levels.
I think a function of that, too, is just the general sentiment and mood out there. I think the American Rescue Plan provides that confidence. We're also, as you know, most of our clients are now in a new budget year. And I think with those expectations for more funding, they saw the real impact to their budgets from last year were not as severe. And I think just -- I think some of that's coming back. And I think you've just also highlight what we've talked about throughout the last 1.5 years is that the demand for what we do doesn't go away. It's going to be pent-up. And so we're starting to see that.

Obviously, Harry Herington, their founder, he decided to retire. One of the key things that we first had to do was establish new leadership. We've done that. Elizabeth Proudfit's now leading that division. She's been with NIC for over 20 years and been responsible for selling most of their major state enterprise contracts, including Florida.
As I mentioned in my comments, we've hit the ground running. Our Tyler teams are showcasing products really 2 to 3 a week with all of their state GMs. Our payments teams have gotten together and working on Tyler technology integration plans, talking about how we can leverage NIC relationships. I guess I'd say all that stuff is -- it's active. It's going on. The excitement continues to be there.
I'll echo my comments from back in June, balancing expectations is -- if you've been around a long time, these things take time. But the excitement's there. And we are seeing and identifying joint opportunities. It takes a while for those to come to fruition. But like I said, every time our teams meet, the excitement only continues to grow."

I guess 2 probably simple ones. The first question is on just general deal flow from the core Tyler side when you talked about how things seem to be normalizing more towards prepandemic levels, the volume of deal flow certainly speaks to that in the quarter. I guess my question there, is that more just pent-up demand that's flowing out? Or are you seeing a true normalization maybe of those cycles in the last quarter or 2?
And then my second question, Brian, is on your guidance for the year. The non, I guess, ongoing revenues from the TourHealth and the pandemic side from NIC was increased from $21 million to $32 million for the year. Did that mean the overall NIC contribution for the year went up that much? Or is it just maybe a shift in revenues within your expected contribution from that business?"

And I'd say it's a little bit of both. Q2 last year was a slow year. And we talked about it in the last couple of earnings calls, about how the impact was really felt a little bit differently across different parts of our business. But what we're starting to see now is that the number of RFPs are up significantly from Q2 a year ago, up over 50%. Trade shows are returning. Our unsigned selections, which we don't talk about a lot, those are up significantly. The number of new deals, as you pointed out, that we signed this quarter was, I think, up over 30% from a year ago.
When you look at areas like where -- I talked about the last few quarters, where we saw a little bit more slowdown was more in our high-end financials, our Munis and our EnerGov solutions. We're certainly seeing the momentum growing there. I think Q4 was probably a low in those areas for RFPs and selections, and those are up significantly.
And remember, those types of deals, they generally take about 3 quarters from RFP to close. So there will continue to be a lag as we're seeing these RFPs come up, but that's continuing other places like our lower-end financials, our Incode. I think RFPs now are actually back to 2019 levels. So it's there. It's a combination of pent-up demand, but also just the market returning."

Unfortunately, with some of the resurgence of COVID and the Delta variant, there's more of a need for testing for a longer period with some of our clients than we had previously expected. And some of those agreements have been extended beyond when we expected that they would roll off. We still expect that they will taper down in the third quarter and pretty minimal revenues from those in the fourth quarter."

But you're right, beyond payments, we talk about that a lot, but one of the things that makes us really excited is the ability to sell Tyler products through those state contracts and really leverage those NIC relationships.
I mean, they've got very deep relationships at the highest levels of state government areas where really Tyler just didn't have access. And I'm talking about governors and senior decision makers and you get in front of those people and we're able to get in front of those people and try to talk to them about, ""What are you guys trying to get done? What policies are you pursuing?"" And whether it's economic development or HHS or prison reform or whatever it is, and we've got the solutions to do it. And that's really the crux of what we're doing with these weekly showcases with Tyler products. We have to educate all of these state, the state GMs and the entire NIC executive team as to what our portfolio is really all about and how we can leverage that.

I mean those contracts that NIC has done an amazing job over the years. It takes them a little bit longer, but really of establishing contracts that are extremely open-ended and as we like to use the term, hunting license. And so it allows those -- under those contracts to pursue a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different agencies and in some cases, even local jurisdictions. It allows them to push products. But more importantly, too, it also -- what they also bring is, as I just mentioned, is their deep relationships with different agencies and different higher execs at the state level, areas that where Tyler just didn't have any exposure.
And so it's leveraging those relationships, leveraging Tyler's products, leveraging those open-ended contracts really creates a whole new opportunity for Tyler that we've never seen before. An example would be we're having discussions with a particular state with some court solutions. And we're actually able to have conversations at an extremely high level at a place where Tyler traditionally just had not been able to do it. And those relationships are coming from those state contracts.
And I mentioned the state of Oregon and the State of Idaho as renewals for NIC. And what's important there is the Oregon contract, that's an extension, but that's an extension of a 10-year relationship. The Idaho contract is a 2-year extension on a 22-year relationship. So these are very deep relationships that NIC has done. Getting these renewals is something you don't take for granted, and you've got to continue to deliver value.
And I think the flip side of that is what Tyler can bring is, as we continue to leverage those relationships and put more products, it will actually bring that more value to those contracts and further deepen those relationships so that those will continue to sustain and survive well into the future."

It's just -- it's up significantly over a year ago. Obviously, we also mentioned the COVID-related services continue to outperform even as we expect those to taper off. But yes, it's that state enterprise transaction revenue, really payments, outdoor licensing and COVID."

And I think as you see going into next year, you're going to continue to see movement of new business into AWS because the goal is to eventually move out of 2 Tyler data centers to 1.

Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NIC's results, and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures",1256,"Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NIC's results, and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures. We achieved new quarterly highs in revenues, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, bookings and backlog. 
Total revenues grew 60.9% with organic growth of 7.6%. As a result of the surge in the Delta variant, NIC's COVID-19-related revenues from TourHealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives were significantly above plan at $43.3 million. We had expected those revenues, which have relatively low margins to wind down in the second half of the year, but we now expect they will continue into the first half of 2022. NIC's core revenues grew 5% in the quarter. 
Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the [ first time ] and were led by 183% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 23.9%, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 55 of the last 63 quarters. Software licenses and services revenues grew 13.9% or 2% excluding NIC. 
As expected, our margins compressed compared to last year's third quarter. Some expenses like trade shows and employee health claims as well as lower margin revenues like billable travel that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic have begun to return this year. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly, by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID initiative revenue. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 25.3%. Excluding NIC's COVID initiative revenues and related costs, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. 
Bookings reached a record high in the third quarter at approximately $601 million, more than double last year's third quarter. Excluding NIC, bookings grew 51.9%, with the biggest contributor being the $63 million renewal of our fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the state of Illinois. 
We're very pleased to report early success this quarter with joint sales efforts between NIC and Tyler Solutions teams. We signed agreements with the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development valued at approximately $24 million to provide a digital and call center solution for tenant, landlord and third-party filing of rent relief program claims. We'll also provide administrative dashboards from our Socrata Data & Insight solutions as well as payment processing capabilities. 
Our largest software deal in the quarter also came from NIC with $6.1 million SaaS contract with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles for digital titling. This new digital vehicle titling and registration management system will go beyond modernization and revolutionize how the DMV manages vehicles and interacts with businesses and citizens. 
In addition to the streamlining of nearly every vehicle-related process in place today, many legacy paper processes will be fully replaced with secure digital solutions. The solution utilizes technology to govern and secure the vehicle ownership process, adding security, reducing fraud and providing the flexibility that other state DMV's operations are lacking. The arrangement, which leverages our state master agreement has an initial term of 5 years. In addition to the SaaS fees, the agreement will generate estimated transaction revenue of more than $3 million per year. 
I'd like to also highlight a few more significant deals signed this quarter. We signed appraisal services contracts with the Delaware Counties in New Castle and Kent. In addition, New Castle County selected our AIS World appraisal solution under a SaaS arrangement. The deals have a combined value of approximately $19 million. Coupled with the appraisal services contract signed last quarter was Sussex County, Tyler will now be performing a property reassessment for the entire state. 
Also for our IAS World Property Tax and Appraisal solution, we signed SaaS arrangements with the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada, valued at approximately $3.1 million. Franklin County, Ohio, valued at approximately $3.5 million and Summit County, Ohio, which also includes our data and insight solution, valued at approximately $2.9 million. 
Other major SaaS deals included a $4.5 million contract with Arlington Heights, Illinois for our ERP civic services and payment solutions and a $3.4 million contract with Bayer County, Texas for our Odyssey SoftCode and Supervision Justice solutions. 
Our largest perpetual license contract for the quarter was a $5.4 million contract to provide our MicroPact and entellitrak solution to manage COVID vaccination at stations for the U.S. Department of Justice. We also signed a $2.5 million on-premises license contract with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana islands for our Munis ERP and Enterprise Asset Management, ExecuTime and Socrata solutions. 
We also signed several significant contract renewals with existing clients, including extensions of NIC's state enterprise agreements with the states of Utah and Oklahoma, and a 5-year renewal of our e-filing arrangement with the state of Illinois, which was expanded to include applications from our Socrata Data and Insights platform. 
On last quarter's call, we reported that NIC had been selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution that would allow taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes, and that revenue under that contract was expected to begin in January of 2022. Following the award, three entities filed protest with the GAO. Prior to any ruling on the protest by the GAO, the IRS notified the GAO that it was canceling the two awards, including the award to NIC. While the IRS has not formally terminated NIC's contract, it has issued a stop work order under the contract. The IRS indicated that it will either amend the current solicitation, allowing all bidders to modify their previous submissions and then reevaluate the proposals or terminate the existing solicitation and start the process over with a new procurement in the coming months. The IRS has not yet stated which of these options it will select and we have no information regarding the potential timing of either option. 
Given these recent developments, we do not expect to recognize any revenue under the IRS award in 2022. While the specific concerns raised in the protests have not been made public and are not known by Tyler, the decision to cancel the award to NIC was not related to NIC's performance under the contract, its ability to successfully perform under the contract or any allegations of misconduct or improper behavior by NIC. 
On the M&A front, we completed the acquisitions of VendEngine and Arx during the third quarter. VendEngine is one of the fastest-growing technology companies in North America, operating in more than 230 counties and 32 states. Its leading cloud-based platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications focused on the corrections market, including deposit technologies for commissary, ordering and warehouse management and various informational electronic communications, security, accounting and financial trust management components. 
Arx is a cloud-based software platform, which creates accessible technology to enable a modern day police force that is fully transparent, accountable and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The acquisition of Arx allows Tyler to offer a full suite of public safety solutions, including Arx Alert and Arx Community, designed to maximize efficiency and safety for law enforcement officers while increasing transparency and trust building with communities. 
VendEngine and Arx have combined ARR of approximately $17.5 million and their additions further strengthen Tyler's Justice and Public Safety suites. 
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more details on the results of the quarter."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers",719,"Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. 
GAAP revenues for the quarter were $459.9 million, up 60.9%. Non-GAAP revenues were $460.6 million, up 61.1%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 13.7%. Subscription revenues rose 183.3%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 23.9%. We added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 67 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $84 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and had 46 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. 
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 47% in Q3 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.3 years last year. 
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $171.2 million, up more than sixfold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.4 million, up 15%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.3%. 
For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.5 billion, up 79.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q3 was approximately $330 million, up 24.7%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $685 million, up 639%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat at approximately $471 million. 
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.77 billion, up 14.3%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $27 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.6%. 
As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $601 million, up 105.7% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $444 million, up 51.9% fueled by the renewal of the State of Illinois fixed e-filling filing arrangement of approximately $63 million and the addition of the two Delaware appraisal deals totaling $19 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.6 billion, up 31.3%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 10.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $19 million in new annual recurring revenue. 
Cash from operations and free cash flow were both record highs for the third quarter at $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid the outstanding balance of $65 million on our revolver and paid down $57.5 million on our term loans for a total debt reduction of $122.5 million. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.428 billion and cash and investments of $348.4 million, and net leverage of approximately 2.3x trailing pro forma EBITDA. We expect the net leverage to be approximately 2x by year-end. 
We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2021 to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 total GAAP revenues will be between $1.577 billion and $1.597 billion, and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.580 billion and $1.6 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $72 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic unemployment services that are expected to wind down in the first half of 2022. 
We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.55 and $3.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.94 and $7.02. 
Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."
309821,1684608710,2415765,"Tyler Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Tyler Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from Tyler's core operations and from NIC in its first full quarter as part of Tyler.

I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from Tyler's core operations and from NIC in its first full quarter as part of Tyler. 
When we spoke to investors in June, we discussed four priorities around the NIC acquisition for 2021. First, don't mess up the business; second, achieve our 2021 plans for both businesses; third, retain NIC staff and establish a long-term leadership team; and fourth, identify and launch joint strategic initiatives and get our sales teams aligned. 
I'm happy to say we are executing on all of those objectives. Both businesses are executing at a high level and are exceeding our 2021 plans. The NIC team under the leadership of [ Elizabeth ] is enthusiastic about the combination and the opportunities ahead with Tyler. And we've hit the ground running, with teams actively working on integration and go-to-market strategies. 
We're showcasing Tyler products to NIC's entire state general manager team, and NIC's general managers are providing detailed reviews of the NIC State Enterprise contracts and relationships for Tyler's team. We've also established a payments technology integration plan and are in the process of finalizing the joint Tyler NIC payments organization. 
We've already had some early success in joint opportunities, such as our contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies that includes NIC payment processing, Tyler's and Teletrack regulatory solutions and our Socrata Data & Insights platform, as well as the recent NIC contract with Virginia for a solution for the rent relief program, which also includes Tyler Socrata applications. 
We have a current pipeline of more than 40 qualified sell-through opportunities with NIC's state enterprise market across multiple Tyler solutions and have identified Tyler sales opportunities leveraging NIC State Enterprise contracts, to speed up the time from award to contract. We're also beginning to build our combined payments pipeline with early sales in Florida and Louisiana. 
We continue to see positive trends in public sector market activity. Indicators such as proposals, sales demonstrations and pipelines are all up significantly from 2020 and are generally at or, in some cases, above pre-COVID levels. Our competitiveness remains strong as reflected by high win rates across our major applications. 
While not yet a significant factor, we're starting to see purchasing activity that is identified as being funded through the federal stimulus under the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan. We expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid to schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years. 
A survey by the National Association of CIOs indicated that most state CIOs expect that remote work will continue and the need for digital services will increase. CIOs said they plan to modernize legacy systems in the next 2 years with human services and public welfare, labor and employment and health services now as priorities. Tyler is well positioned to help public sector leaders address those needs. 
We also remain on track with our R&D projects around our cloud initiative and with our progress toward hosting new SaaS implementations and on-premises conversions in AWS. Our cloud operations team is engaged in 2022 planning with a focus on continued product optimization, data center migration and operations maturity. 
Finally, I want to welcome the newest member of Tyler's executive leadership team, [ Kevin Ierson ], who joined Tyler earlier this month as Chief Information Officer. Kevin is a seasoned IT leader with experience managing technology infrastructures for corporations, statewide judicial courts, statewide executive government agencies and U.S. military organizations, most recently serving as CIO for the Idaho Judicial branch. Kevin will work closely with our former CIO, Matt Barry, until Matt's retirement early next year. I'd also like to express our deep appreciation to Matt for his tremendous leadership of our IT and hosting organization over the last 11 years and wish him the best in his retirement. 
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

In NIC, as we had discussed, the COVID-related initiative revenues have continued beyond when we thought even at the end of last quarter, they would wind down. We had a -- at the end of last quarter, our guidance had about $17 million for the second half of the year, and we did $43 million under those initiatives in Q3 and expect the full year to be about $72 million. So about another $13 million or so in the fourth quarter. And some of that then continuing on into next year. 
But NIC's core growth, excluding this core -- those COVID initiatives was around 5% in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, in the third quarter. And there is some seasonality in their fourth quarter core operations, particularly in the holidays and some of the transaction volumes tend to fall in the fourth quarter. So their fourth quarter probably is what -- our guidance reflects that in the fourth quarter numbers."

Some were hit a little bit harder. And I think I've mentioned before that if you look at, for example, our mid- to higher-end financials, our Munis product, that was an area that was hit a little bit harder.

So each of the last couple of quarters have been new all-time highs for us in terms of the number of conversions. And certainly, when you look back at the last 4 quarters, which all kind of filter into the maintenance growth, the last 4 quarters have well exceeded the flips or conversions that we saw in the prior year. 
And just as the new business is shifting towards more SaaS, there's an increasing interest in on-prem customers flipping. So that does have a negative effect on maintenance. But generally, the revenues that are going into the subscription side, as they flip, is about 2x what the maintenance was. So that's a component on the other side of the high growth in subscriptions. 
And then you look at the mix of new business over the last year as it continues to shift towards more SaaS and less license that has an effect on the growth as well. 
And then the last thing is some attrition around a legacy product at -- in the federal business where the federal government has mandated some states to move off of our product and on to a federal-provided product that's had a bit of an impact there as well. So -- but the flip, I'd say, the biggest impact, those ongoing conversions, and that will continue to be the case. And at some point, over the next couple of years, likely be a significant acceleration on those as we have the ability to accelerate that through moving those customers into AWS."

That means that COVID is getting further in our rearview mirror. It's our expectation. 
The revenues right now are primarily out of three areas. It's out of the state of South Carolina, where they're the primary -- doing the primary testing. Also, in the state of Nevada. And then we've mentioned the Virginia unemployment release stuff. 
The expectation is -- I mean, it is a little bit of a guess, but it's an educated guess, and we're assuming that, that will wind down. What's interesting about the South Carolina revenues is that we'll move from a contractor role to a subcontractor role. So while those revenues will still continue and eventually taper off, I think our margins on those will increase. 
I think what's important about the COVID initiative though is it really shows the ability of NIC's team to innovate, it shows their agility, and it also shows the relationships that they have with their state enterprise contracts, if they could spend these things up quickly and create new solutions. And I think that's what's exciting. 
When you talk about -- I think your first question was about growth rates going forward. We're excited. I can't tell you how excited the sales teams are as they meet, they get together. I think as we move forward, and we talk about selling all of our different products through the NIC sales channels and conversely, what we can bring to NIC. But you think about with Tyler payments and we're already seeing a lot of our Socrata Data & Insights and entellitrak platform, public safety and civic and Munis, all those deals are in the pipeline. 
And I don't know that going forward, we'll always be able to sort of segregate these were NIC deals because these are Tyler products going through them, would probably, at some point, won't continue to isolate NIC revenue growth. But what we see overall with Tyler is, as part of this acquisition and part of the underlying rationale is that we believe it will help drive Tyler's overall revenue growth at a higher level than it would have on its own."

Arx is a -- we are excited about Arx. It was a relatively small acquisition. And Arx really, it's a database solution that really helps the Chief of Police, helps the command staff, help supervisors really have more insight in the activity of the law enforcement that are on the job, helps with compliance issues, helps promote officer wellness by doing things like identifying stress, risk mitigation. 
And you're right, there has been sort of the talk around the public safety area in a lot of different areas and a lot of focus lately and has been on law enforcement reform. And this was something that was missing in our product suite. Arx is a company that's based in Detroit, which is close to our public safety office in [ Detroit ]. They had been a partner of public safety and a number of deals. This solution had been sought out more and more. And you're right, it really rounds out our portfolio of public safety solutions. 
I'd expect it to be something like we do a lot of acquisitions that it's something we're going to sell in our inside channels, and it's also going to become a differentiator in new deals. You're seeing more and more public safety entities looking for these types of solutions for the reasons you just talked about. 
When you talk about the funding for public safety, I mentioned earlier that different parts of our business were impacted differently. And public safety is, not suggesting it wasn't impacted, but it's still going pretty good. The number of license deals that it's got this year, their expected licenses are up over 35% year-over-year. We've talked a lot before about the investments we've made there and the number of deals that will be $1 million plus and license will be more than we've ever had before. 
I think the funding is there. The initiatives are there. And we've been making a lot of investments, and we've done some acquisitions around mobility and things like that, that make us even more competitive. So I'm pretty still -- I'm still very excited about where we stand with public safety and where the future is for that."

I know Matt asked that first question about the stimulus funds and you touched on that.

And you mentioned, I think, the pipeline of, I think it does heard by Fed and federal stim. 
Just curious what you're hearing from customers. You mentioned a pretty wide swath of Tyler products. And can we assume that the bulk of Tyler's products would qualify and are available under that? And then if not, I think you mentioned kind of potential tailwind over many years. So are there two ways to think about this? Is it one way to think about it, yes, federal stimulus dollars are going to be flowing to Tyler, clear, positive? Another would be that budgets being shored up also creates opportunities for more confidence in spending? Or is that kind of the right way to think about a couple of different buckets?"

I'm not suggesting that they're being fully funded, but they are -- they have maybe partial funding or part of the equation. 
I think your comment is around confidence is something that I've touched on before. And I believe the confidence of having that blanket behind them, along with generally what's been going on in the market, is helpful for all the deals. 
We are seeing federal stimulus when I talk about these few dozen deals, they are across different products of Tyler. I don't know that one would really necessarily single out more than others, although there are some stimulus dollars that are specifically tied to schools. 
So I think generally, it's a positive. It's something that still -- a lot of our clients and prospective clients are -- there's still a lot of them still trying to figure out how do we access them, which dollars are actually there. And it's something that our marketing team, in conjunction with our sales teams, are putting together materials to help educate our clients and help navigate them where we can. 
But yes, it's a tailwind. Generally speaking, it's hard to quantify at this point. But overall, I think it's part of the reason for optimism we have at Tyler."

They're pretty much aligned. They're pretty reliable. Like I said, there's a little bit of seasonality. So we saw higher growth last quarter. A little bit lower growth this quarter. One of the areas that's been impacted in their business more by COVID is the driver history records, which is a significant part of their business. And the growth there is a little slow right now, but expect those to rebound as things get back to normal. 
But offsetting that is that transaction volumes are generally up, given that people are doing more business digitally with state government. So -- but generally, the bookings and revenues would be pretty similar."

I've talked before about how we approach M&A generally, and we've done a little bit this year. And I think earlier, when we were talking about NIC, I said, we may go back to a couple of years ago, where we have a little bit of deliberate pause. We did couple of other deals this year, VendEngine, DataSpec, these were deals that were sort of in the works. 
I think though, as we go into next year, we're going to remain opportunistic. We're going to continue to look at deals. I continue to look at deals today. I've been looking at deals over the last couple of months, even though while we still have all this activity going on.

But for VendEngine, corrections, and in the corrections market, for us, was something that we've really seen as a significant growth opportunity. We've been investing in some -- in our core corrections product for some time. It's a key part of our Tyler Alliance, which is our Connected Communities vision. And it's really sort of -- the corrections areas sort of the crossover points between courts and public safety. And it's probably the largest market in justice white space that we didn't really have a leading product. 
And inmate services is becoming increasingly important to that opportunity. There's more and more requirements, RFPs around there. We've partnered with VendEngine over the years and in a number of deals, and they're really just a leader there. I expect that their revenue this year will be somewhere in the $20 million, all ARR, and it's been growing at 30-plus percent for the last few years. I do think we have enough opportunity to sell that into our existing client base, but also it will help us lead with our corrections and stand-alone deals. So we're pretty excited about that deal. 
And similar with Arx, I talked a little bit about before about the focus on law enforcement reform, and that was a bit of a hole in our portfolio. Again, almost similar playbook. We had worked with them some. Really like them. Really like the product. A good cultural fit. And we really think it will round out our portfolio. And as you mentioned, selling back into our base. 
I mean, our existing customer base, its' something that I say all the time, it's our greatest asset. And the more solutions we have, the more that we can push through there and drive growth."

Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NIC's results, and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures",1252,"Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NIC's results, and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures. We achieved new quarterly highs in revenues, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, bookings and backlog.
Total revenues grew 60.9% with organic growth of 7.6%. As a result of the surge in the Delta variant, NIC's COVID-19-related revenues from TourHealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives were significantly above plan at $43.3 million. We had expected those revenues, which have relatively low margins to wind down in the second half of the year, but we now expect they will continue into the first half of 2022. NIC's core revenues grew 5% in the quarter. 
Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the first time and were led by 183% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 23.9%, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 55 of the last 63 quarters. Software licenses and services revenues grew 13.9% or 2% excluding NIC.
As expected, our margins compressed compared to last year's third quarter. Some expenses like trade shows and employee health claims as well as lower margin revenues like billable travel that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic have begun to return this year. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly, by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID initiative revenue. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 25.3%. Excluding NIC's COVID initiative revenues and related costs, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. 
Bookings reached a record high in the third quarter at approximately $601 million, more than double last year's third quarter. Excluding NIC, bookings grew 51.9%, with the biggest contributor being the $63 million renewal of our fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the state of Illinois.
We're very pleased to report early success this quarter with joint sales efforts between NIC and Tyler Solutions teams. We signed agreements with the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development valued at approximately $24 million to provide a digital and call center solution for tenant, landlord and third-party filing of rent relief program claims. We'll also provide administrative dashboards from our Socrata Data & Insight solutions as well as payment processing capabilities.
Our largest software deal in the quarter also came from NIC with $6.1 million SaaS contract with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles for digital titling. This new digital vehicle titling and registration management system will go beyond modernization and revolutionize how the DMV manages vehicles and interacts with businesses and citizens.
In addition to the streamlining of nearly every vehicle-related process in place today, many legacy paper processes will be fully replaced with secure digital solutions. The solution utilizes technology to govern and secure the vehicle ownership process, adding security, reducing fraud and providing the flexibility that other state DMV's operations are lacking. The arrangement, which leverages our state master agreement has an initial term of 5 years. In addition to the SaaS fees, the agreement will generate estimated transaction revenue of more than $3 million per year.
I'd like to also highlight a few more significant deals signed this quarter. We signed appraisal services contracts with the Delaware Counties in New Castle and Kent. In addition, New Castle County selected our iasWorld appraisal solution under a SaaS arrangement. The deals have a combined value of approximately $19 million. Coupled with the appraisal services contract signed last quarter was Sussex County, Tyler will now be performing a property reassessment for the entire state.
Also for our iasWorld Property Tax and Appraisal solution, we signed SaaS arrangements with the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada, valued at approximately $3.1 million. Franklin County, Ohio, valued at approximately $3.5 million and Summit County, Ohio, which also includes our Data & Insights Solutions, valued at approximately $2.9 million.
Other major SaaS deals included a $4.5 million contract with Arlington Heights, Illinois for our ERP civic services and payment solutions and a $3.4 million contract with Bayer County, Texas for our Odyssey, SoftCode and Supervision Justice solutions. 
Our largest perpetual license contract for the quarter was a $5.4 million contract to provide our MicroPact and entellitrak solution to manage COVID vaccination at stations for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
We also signed a $2.5 million on-premises license contract with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana islands for our Munis ERP and Enterprise Asset Management, ExecuTime and Socrata solutions. 
We also signed several significant contract renewals with existing clients, including extensions of NIC's state enterprise agreements with the states of Utah and Oklahoma, and a 5-year renewal of our e-filing arrangement with the state of Illinois, which was expanded to include applications from our Socrata Data and Insights platform.
On last quarter's call, we reported that NIC had been selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution that would allow taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes, and that revenue under that contract was expected to begin in January of 2022. 
Following the award, three entities filed protest with the GAO. Prior to any ruling on the protest by the GAO, the IRS notified the GAO that it was canceling the two awards, including the award to NIC. While the IRS has not formally terminated NIC's contract, it has issued a stop work order under the contract. The IRS indicated that it will either amend the current solicitation, allowing all bidders to modify their previous submissions and then reevaluate the proposals or terminate the existing solicitation and start the process over with a new procurement in the coming months. The IRS has not yet stated which of these options it will select and we have no information regarding the potential timing of either option.
Given these recent developments, we do not expect to recognize any revenue under the IRS award in 2022. While the specific concerns raised in the protests have not been made public and are not known by Tyler, the decision to cancel the award to NIC was not related to NIC's performance under the contract, its ability to successfully perform under the contract or any allegations of misconduct or improper behavior by NIC.
On the M&A front, we completed the acquisitions of VendEngine and Arx during the third quarter. VendEngine is one of the fastest-growing technology companies in North America, operating in more than 230 counties and 32 states. Its leading cloud-based platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications focused on the corrections market, including deposit technologies for commissary, ordering and warehouse management and various informational electronic communications, security, accounting and financial trust management components.
Arx is a cloud-based software platform, which creates accessible technology to enable a modern day police force that is fully transparent, accountable and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The acquisition of Arx allows Tyler to offer a full suite of public safety solutions, including Arx Alert and Arx Community, designed to maximize efficiency and safety for law enforcement officers while increasing transparency and trust building with communities.
VendEngine and Arx have combined ARR of approximately $17.5 million and their additions further strengthen Tyler's Justice and Public Safety suites.
Now I'd like for Brian to provide more details on the results of the quarter."

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers",719,"Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.
GAAP revenues for the quarter were $459.9 million, up 60.9%. Non-GAAP revenues were $460.6 million, up 61.1%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. 
Software license revenues rose 13.7%. Subscription revenues rose 183.3%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 23.9%. We added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 67 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $84 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and had 46 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value.
Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 47% in Q3 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.3 years last year.
Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $171.2 million, up more than sixfold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.4 million, up 15%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.3%.
For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.5 billion, up 79.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q3 was approximately $330 million, up 24.7%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $685 million, up 639%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat at approximately $471 million.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.77 billion, up 14.3%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $27 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.6%.
As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $601 million, up 105.7% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $444 million, up 51.9% fueled by the renewal of the State of Illinois fixed e-filling filing arrangement of approximately $63 million and the addition of the two Delaware appraisal deals totaling $19 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.6 billion, up 31.3%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 10.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $19 million in new annual recurring revenue.
Cash from operations and free cash flow were both record highs for the third quarter at $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid the outstanding balance of $65 million on our revolver and paid down $57.5 million on our term loans for a total debt reduction of $122.5 million. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.428 billion and cash and investments of $348.4 million, and net leverage of approximately 2.3x trailing pro forma EBITDA. We expect the net leverage to be approximately 2x by year-end.
We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2021 to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 total GAAP revenues will be between $1.577 billion and $1.597 billion, and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.580 billion and $1.6 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $72 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic unemployment services that are expected to wind down in the first half of 2022.
We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.55 and $3.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.94 and $7.02.
Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn."

I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from Tyler's core operations and from NIC in its first full quarter as part of Tyler.
When we spoke to investors in June, we discussed four priorities around the NIC acquisition for 2021. First, don't mess up the business; second, achieve our 2021 plans for both businesses; third, retain NIC staff and establish a long-term leadership team; and fourth, identify and launch joint strategic initiatives and get our sales teams aligned.
I'm happy to say we are executing on all of those objectives. Both businesses are executing at a high level and are exceeding our 2021 plans. The NIC team under the leadership of Elizabeth Proudfit is enthusiastic about the combination and the opportunities ahead with Tyler. And we've hit the ground running, with teams actively working on integration and go-to-market strategies.
We're showcasing Tyler products to NIC's entire state general manager team, and NIC's general managers are providing detailed reviews of the NIC State Enterprise contracts and relationships for Tyler's team. We've also established a payments technology integration plan and are in the process of finalizing the joint Tyler NIC payments organization.
We've already had some early success in joint opportunities, such as our contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies that includes NIC payment processing, Tyler's entellitrak regulatory solutions and our Socrata Data & Insights platform, as well as the recent NIC contract with Virginia for a solution for the rent relief program, which also includes Tyler Socrata applications.
We have a current pipeline of more than 40 qualified sell-through opportunities with NIC's state enterprise market across multiple Tyler solutions and have identified Tyler sales opportunities leveraging NIC State Enterprise contracts, to speed up the time from award to contract. We're also beginning to build our combined payments pipeline with early sales in Florida and Louisiana.
We continue to see positive trends in public sector market activity. Indicators such as proposals, sales demonstrations and pipelines are all up significantly from 2020 and are generally at or, in some cases, above pre-COVID levels. Our competitiveness remains strong as reflected by high win rates across our major applications.
While not yet a significant factor, we're starting to see purchasing activity that is identified as being funded through the federal stimulus under the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan. We expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid to schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years.
A survey by the National Association of CIOs indicated that most state CIOs expect that remote work will continue and the need for digital services will increase. CIOs said they plan to modernize legacy systems in the next 2 years with human services and public welfare, labor and employment and health services noted as priorities. Tyler is well positioned to help public sector leaders address those needs.
We also remain on track with our R&D projects around our cloud initiative and with our progress toward hosting new SaaS implementations and on-premises conversions in AWS. Our cloud operations team is engaged in 2022 planning with a focus on continued product optimization, data center migration and operations maturity.
Finally, I want to welcome the newest member of Tyler's executive leadership team, Kevin Iwerson, who joined Tyler earlier this month as Chief Information Officer. Kevin is a seasoned IT leader with experience managing technology infrastructures for corporations, statewide judicial courts, statewide executive government agencies and U.S. military organizations, most recently serving as CIO for the Idaho Judicial branch.
Kevin will work closely with our former CIO, Matt Bieri, until Matt's retirement early next year. I'd also like to express our deep appreciation to Matt for his tremendous leadership of our IT and hosting organization over the last 11 years and wish him the best in his retirement.
With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A."

And that would imply, again, at the midpoint of our guidance, around 11% growth for the core Tyler operations in the fourth quarter.
In NIC, as we had discussed, the COVID-related initiative revenues have continued beyond when we thought even at the end of last quarter, they would wind down. We had a -- at the end of last quarter, our guidance had about $17 million for the second half of the year, and we did $43 million under those initiatives in Q3 and expect the full year to be about $72 million. So about another $13 million or so in the fourth quarter. And some of that then continuing on into next year.
But NIC's core growth, excluding this core -- those COVID initiatives was around 5% in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, in the third quarter. And there is some seasonality in their fourth quarter core operations, particularly around the holidays and some of the transaction volumes tend to fall in the fourth quarter. So their fourth quarter probably is what -- our guidance reflects that in the fourth quarter numbers."

Some were hit a little bit harder. And I think I've mentioned before that if you look at, for example, our mid- to higher-end financials, our Munis product, that was an area that was hit a little bit harder.

So each of the last couple of quarters have been new all-time highs for us in terms of the number of conversions. And certainly, when you look back at the last 4 quarters, which all kind of filter into the maintenance growth. The last 4 quarters have well exceeded the flips or conversions that we saw in the prior year.
And just as the new business is shifting towards more SaaS, there's an increasing interest in on-prem customers flipping. So that does have a negative effect on maintenance. But generally, the revenues that are going into the subscription side, as they flip, is about 2x what the maintenance was. So that's a component on the other side of the high growth in subscriptions.
And then you look at the mix of new business over the last year as it continues to shift towards more SaaS and less license that has an effect on the growth as well.
And then the last thing is some attrition around a legacy product at -- in the federal business where the federal government has mandated some states to move off of our product and on to a federal-provided product that's had a bit of an impact there as well. So -- but the flip, I'd say, the biggest impact, those ongoing conversions, and that will continue to be the case. And at some point, over the next couple of years, likely be a significant acceleration on those as we have the ability to accelerate that through moving those customers into AWS."

That means that COVID is getting further in our rearview mirror. It's our expectation.
The revenues right now are primarily out of three areas. It's out of the state of South Carolina, where they're the primary -- doing the primary testing. Also, in the state of Nevada. And then we've mentioned the Virginia unemployment release stuff. 
The expectation is -- I mean, it is a little bit of a guess, but it's an educated guess, and we're assuming that, that will wind down. What's interesting about the South Carolina revenues is that we'll move from a contractor role to a subcontractor role. So while those revenues will still continue and eventually taper off, I think our margins on those will increase.
I think what's important about the COVID initiative though is it really shows the ability of NIC's team to innovate, it shows their agility, and it also shows the relationships that they have with their state enterprise contracts, if they could spin these things up quickly and create new solutions. And I think that's what's exciting.
When you talk about -- I think your first question was about growth rates going forward. We're excited. I can't tell you how excited the sales teams are as they meet, they get together. I think as we move forward, and we talk about selling all of our different products through the NIC sales channels and conversely, what we can bring to NIC. But you think about with Tyler payments and we're already seeing a lot of our Socrata Data & Insights and entellitrak platform, public safety and civic and Munis, all those deals are in the pipeline.
And I don't know that going forward, we'll always be able to sort of segregate these were NIC deals because these are Tyler products going through them, would probably, at some point, won't continue to isolate NIC revenue growth. But what we see overall with Tyler is, as part of this acquisition and part of the underlying rationale is that we believe it will help drive Tyler's overall revenue growth at a higher level than it would have on its own."

And you're right, there has been sort of the talk around the public safety area in a lot of different areas and a lot of focus lately and has been on law enforcement reform. And this was something that was missing in our product suite.
Arx is a company that's based in Detroit, which is close to our public safety office in Detroit. They had been a partner of public safety in a number of deals. This solution had been sought out more and more. And you're right, it really rounds out our portfolio of public safety solutions.
I'd expect it to be something like we do a lot of acquisitions that it's something we're going to sell in our inside channels, and it's also going to become a differentiator in new deals. You're seeing more and more public safety entities looking for these types of solutions for the reasons you just talked about.
When you talk about the funding for public safety, I mentioned earlier that different parts of our business were impacted differently. And public safety is, not suggesting it wasn't impacted, but it's still going pretty good. The number of license deals that it's got this year, their expected licenses are up over 35% year-over-year. We've talked a lot before about the investments we've made there and the number of deals that will be $1 million plus and license will be more than we've ever had before.
I think the funding is there. The initiatives are there. And we've been making a lot of investments, and we've done some acquisitions around mobility and things like that, that make us even more competitive.

I think your comment is around confidence is something that I've touched on before. And I believe the confidence of having that blanket behind them, along with generally what's been going on in the market, is helpful for all the deals. 
We are seeing federal stimulus when I talk about these few dozen deals, they are across different products of Tyler. I don't know that one would really necessarily single out more than others, although there are some stimulus dollars that are specifically tied to schools.
So I think generally, it's a positive. It's something that still -- a lot of our clients and prospective clients are -- there's still a lot of them still trying to figure out how do we access them, which dollars are actually there.

We've targeted kind of in the 4% to 5% annual increases and on subscription renewals. Targets are generally in that same range. And as you said, shortening the initial terms because those revenues are straight-lined over the term of the agreement gives us the opportunity to realize the benefit of those increases sooner.
And generally, we're leading with shorter terms. And this quarter had success with that, occasionally, particularly on some of the large contracts like I think back to the North Carolina Courts & Justice, we have a 10-year agreement. So that can bounce around a bit. But we do prefer to have shorter agreements and the pricing has been in line with what we've historically tried to achieve."

I mean, it didn't mean to imply we weren't excited about Arx. I think I just talked about Arx a little bit.
But for VendEngine, corrections -- in the corrections market, for us, was something that we've really seen as a significant growth opportunity. We've been investing in some -- in our core corrections product for some time. It's a key part of our Tyler Alliance, which is our Connected Communities vision. And it's really sort of -- the corrections areas sort of the crossover points between courts and public safety. And it's probably the largest market in justice white space that we didn't really have a leading product.
And inmate services is becoming increasingly important to that opportunity. There's more and more requirements, RFPs around there. We've partnered with VendEngine over the years and in a number of deals, and they're really just a leader there. I expect that their revenue this year will be somewhere in the $20 million, all ARR, and it's been growing at 30-plus percent for the last few years. I do think we have enough opportunity to sell that into our existing client base, but also it will help us lead with our corrections and stand-alone deals. So we're pretty excited about that deal.
And similar with Arx, I talked a little bit about before about the focus on law enforcement reform, and that was a bit of a hole in our portfolio. Again, almost similar playbook. We had worked with them some. Really like them. Really like the product. A good cultural fit. And we really think it will round out our portfolio. And as you mentioned, selling back into our base.
I mean, our existing customer base, its' something that I say all the time, it's our greatest asset. And the more solutions we have, the more that we can push through there and drive growth."

But we also talk about Mobility and Brazos and SoftCode and MobileEyes. These are all products that were done through acquisitions in the last 3, 4, 5 years or so. You see it on the enterprise side, things like ExecuTime, time and attendance management. We've seen it in the court space. And it is part of our overall strategy.

Others are more one-off. These three counties in Delaware that comprise all of Delaware that we're getting ready to start. It was a court-ordered reappraisal. So sometimes the courts get involved when it's determine that appraisals are out of date and maybe contributing to unfair distribution of taxes. So that's the case with these.
And we're pretty uniquely positioned to be able to have a strong competitive position in those large deals, those one-off kinds of deals. They can be a little bit lumpy. And -- but I'd say we're generally in a range. We're probably on a more active period right now, particularly coming out of COVID where some of these projects may have been delayed.
