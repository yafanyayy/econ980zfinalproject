Good morning, and welcome to our 2020 fourth quarter and year-end earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. 
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full year performance as well as our 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
We finished 2020 in a very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis. Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth; organic growth in all 4 of our categories: Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition; and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well. Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show. 
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement. We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange. Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in pricing. The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind. In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, where we were up 100 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis, where we were up 90 basis points. For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 320 basis point headwind, driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 280 basis point benefit. 
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year on a base business basis. In the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis. This was primarily driven by a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind growth in innovation. 
For the full year, on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points, driven primarily by a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics costs. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year-over-year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis. For the full year, our EPS growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis. We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year. As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Florida transaction, with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases. 
A few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic. We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our Skin Health businesses in the quarter. Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly, with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales. North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the hum by Colgate electric brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen, our Toothpaste business and Irish Spring. 
Latin America net sales were down low single digits, as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year. Oral Care innovation has been a key growth driver, with Colgate Total Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal and our natural extracts line, all driving incremental growth. 
Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all 3 segments: Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care; and in every hub. Strong Oral Care volume growth on the Colgate and Almex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional media and digital. We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga, where strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel. 
We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, led by volume growth across our biggest hubs: Greater China, India, the Philippines and South Pacific. In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate [ Bed Shocking ] in India and our relaunched Colgate Anti-cavity business across the division. Our Personal Care and Home Care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region. 
Africa/Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all 3 categories and in every hub. Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Total. Marinol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel. 
Hill's finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons. Organic sales growth was again led by the U.S. with e-commerce up significantly, but Europe also delivered double-digit growth. Encouragingly, we are seeing a reacceleration in our Prescription Diet business as that channel traffic continues to improve. 
And now for guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year although we expect currencies to remain volatile. We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. We expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID. Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both a GAAP and base business basis. We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. On a base business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Obviously, this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year. There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range. First, COVID-related consumption. 
In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year-over-year in 2021 depending on the market. However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels. So, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing. We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment and foreign exchange. 
Raw materials. We have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated. If this continues, it could put pressure on gross margin expansion, depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity. 
Finally, logistics. We have seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S., but also related to shipping containers in Asia. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term, but to moderate later in the year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutula to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced. And obviously, we're deeply excited to have him here. He's hit the ground running already. 
As I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed 3 topics related to how we plan to manage through the crisis. These 3 topics were: Staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies were necessary and executing with agility; and importantly, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. 
On the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people, and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. 
We worked with the World Health Organization this year and local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of. 
In the second area, we continue to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY; increasing our brand building globally; and executing against our digital transformation. And as John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizable negative impact from foreign exchange. 
But most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic: Managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. So now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are 3 reasons. 
The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products. We can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. So we have strengthened existing tools and importantly built new capabilities to drive this growth. 
For example, on Hill's, we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration on what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It's not just spending more but spending smarter. 
In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by 3 points in the last 2 years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management. 
As I discussed at the Barclays conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently. And given the Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. 
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line. We need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results, where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. We're doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads and laser-focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement. Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in this -- in the transformational capabilities that were deployed, and that we'll rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively. 
The third reason is that we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise; launched more online specific innovation like the Optic White Pen, the Miracle Repair serum; and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. And all of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. 
And lastly, it's building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation. Like our transition to SAP S/4HANA, it's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes and simplified transactions. We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster and with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. 
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process. You will remember that was called CBP. That will significantly reduce the process time require while providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. 
So to sum it up, while I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. 
And with that, I'll be happy to take your questions."

You mentioned optimism on pricing for 2021, also mentioned the rising raw material environment, clearly. So just wanted to understand the balance between pricing and volume in your 3% to 5% organic sales growth outlook. How much pricing you're assuming? And perhaps you can touch on your ability to take further pricing in emerging markets in a weaker dollar environment and given the state of the consumer. And then in the U.S., the promotional environment also relative to 2020. And the gist of the question is sort of, yes, look, it's a robust organic sales growth outlook relative to last year. So just trying to understand what gives you confidence versus a tough comparison and how pricing plays into that."
262247,701739572,2185815,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Darryl. Let me come back again, I guess, overarching in terms of strategy for us because it plays into, obviously, our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price.

Let me come back again, I guess, overarching in terms of strategy for us because it plays into, obviously, our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. And obviously, you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories. It certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working. But let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. 
Obviously, the refocus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that move through foreign exchange, we've been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market. We've been very focused on delivering revenue growth management discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. We've addressed adjacencies in certain markets, which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We've talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up. And obviously, the discipline that we've historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction. And you've seen that, particularly in the back half of this year. And so we'll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple of months. 
So again, it's our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. And we see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. 
Relative to your question on the promotional environment. Certainly, we've seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously, we had some low points. But if you take the back half, just as an example, in Toothpaste, we're looking now at running the -- the category's running at about 28% to sales [ up ] promotion. Pre-COVID, it was running 31%, 32%. So it's back to where it was kind of previously. And my sense is there's discipline in the market. We'll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back in the stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece. But right now, it's more disciplined, and we'll continue to manage that going forward. But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we're thinking about premium, core and adjacencies. And then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world. That's allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace."

So as we look in into 2021, how we should be thinking as you see your outlook for volumes?"
262247,701739572,2185815,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. 2 aspects there.

I think behind the question is kind of where our inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly, following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in the subsequent quarters, second, third and in the fourth. And trade inventories obviously, I think, are well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January. I think as the retailers came out of the Christmas season, they overloaded in some commodity categories, and they're looking to balance it across the board. But by and large, we're where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high-demand categories is basically there, and we think we're in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like liquid hand soap and dish given the heightened demand. But overall, inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. 
I think what's interesting, another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world. And that, again, comes back to the point that we've talked about before that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth getting to where consumers are shopping. And the high growth that we've seen, obviously, in e-commerce and other channels that are nontracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the nontracked are growing at a significant multiple to the track channels today. So by and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you've seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building."

Interesting question, Nik. I mean, strategically, when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we've seen in categories like oral health and skin health, let me start with oral health, where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they've begun to embrace telehealth. And what's interesting is go back 2 years, and telehealth was very much nonexistent. And obviously, COVID has accelerated trends necessary. And the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting. Let's take the new product that we've launched online this year, the hum electric toothbrush, which gives you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you're brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. And we see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home. And you can start to piece it together long term how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. 
Likewise, in skin health, the same thing. We're starting to see, obviously, telehealth expand there. We're seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel as an example, where we've launched a new entry-level skin peel through PCA that we -- that allows us to do more do it at home at -- versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously, for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the professional to do that. 
So there's certainly a trend there. We've got people working on that and an opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices."

Obviously, the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when the -- you'll see the categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you've seen, particularly in COVID-related c",534,"So let's talk a little bit more on the categories. Obviously, the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when the -- you'll see the categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you've seen, particularly in COVID-related categories, like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. And our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget, where that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020, but slightly above the 19% level. So we still expect that we'll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus '19. 
So that's -- but again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent, some markets in Europe, which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. You have not seen that in emerging markets. In fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent, Asia, the Middle East, you've seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you've seen in the emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we've seen both in price and volume across our big emerging markets and the growth that's come behind that, which has been terrific. 
So again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we'll see things normalize, and that's built into the current consensus as we -- as John laid out. 
In terms of advertising, again, strategic [ for us ] this year. We talked about it from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we've seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we're seeing significant growth in the category. So let's take the Hill's business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year-end in the fourth quarter. And you've obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. And that's a business with a more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration. So the runway ahead of that business, we believe, continues to be very strong, and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we're getting the return on that. 
And likewise, in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we've launched in the back half, the Whitening Pen, the Super Premium Optic White Renewal Toothpaste, some of the work that we're doing on hum online and being much more targeted in that space. So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies. So we're quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L."

Noel, I want to spend some time on your emerging markets business, so specifically around category growth and market share momentum and then kind of tie that into your outlook for the year. So obviously, really strong performance, and that's been part of the story here, driving the solid results in the back half of the year. Pricing has remained a strong contributor. Everyone kind of understands that with respect to inflation and FX headwinds that the company has been coping with. But I think what's noteworthy is that volume has been quite resilient in the back half of the year in a way that it wasn't, even despite the fact you're lapping tougher year-over-year comparisons. So I was hoping you could spend a moment, is this sort of the rising tide is raising all boats? Have you observed an acceleration in your categories, perhaps owing to increased consumer mobility related to the pandemic? Or are you seeing very tangible signs of encouraging market share momentum owing to some of the strategic shifts in spending and investment that you discussed earlier in the call? And if you could just sort of tie that. And also at a high level, what is the company embedding in its 2021 outlook related to emerging markets?"
262247,701739572,2185815,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year relat",604,"Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year relative to the comparison [ on developed ]. And a lot of the good volume growth we've driven in those markets is, again, comes back to the strategy, more premium innovation where we are underindexed. 
You heard me mention Brazil, where we've increased 3 points in super-premium toothpaste. ASPs are up about 12% [ in ] all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now we've given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we've seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points. But the quality of our share and the profitability of our share in that market is far better than it was given the focus on premium innovation. 
The other point that's driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core, focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste business in those markets where we've seen, obviously, a sluggish market growth. Our shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a track channel issue, again, driven by good core innovation, taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple of markets. 
And the third would be the adjacency strategy that we've had in emerging markets, whether that's in Africa, whether that's in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion and to have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America as an example behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we've been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies that played out. 
The other piece of this is while depending on where you are, the emerging growth of e-commerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we've seen in emerging, e-commerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously, in Asia, the inverse. It's a significant growth in the category right now, and we've had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China, behind some of the unique innovation that we put in the market. We'll see how e-commerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases. But if you take the China piece specifically, where we've been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we've seen our market shares in e-commerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategies that we've been deploying. 
So overall, I think we've been looking at the channel growth in the right way. We've been looking at the portfolio strategy from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we'll start to see a reacceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021. And obviously, they've been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. So the belief is that in the back half, we'll see that start to stabilize and we'll see markets return, which will give us, obviously, an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume."

And it -- obviously, the exception that we actually get to see numbers for a specific country for you. And I know it's small, but the thing that struck me was top line growth was good but not great, but margin expansion was huge, off the charts. And gross margin, I think, in India is now north of 70%. And I just wanted to ask about it in the context, Noel, of your focus on balanced growth. And again, India is a small market, but when I think about kind of some of your other big emerging market businesses, that should be faster growers over the long term, I think, to help you meet your long-term growth algorithm. At what point do you say, ""Wow, a 70% gross margin in an emerging market businesses is too high."" Are there other countries where margins have really been exploding like that? It just struck me as kind of a surprise in the numbers, and I wondered if there was something more to it in terms of how you think about balancing top line versus bottom line growth kind of over the longer term."

Thanks, Wendy. Listen, India is a very important market for us. We were very pleased with the rebound in the growth that we saw in the back half of 2020, given some of the COVID issues experienced in the first quarter leading to lockdowns at the back end of that quarter and into the second quarter, generating 7% organic in the third and just shy of 10% organic in the fourth, we think, is a terrific performance. 
Again, coming back to the strategy, India is very focused, likewise, given the strong Oral Care business we have on premiumizing that marketplace. And we've launched premium SKUs in the [ Bhakti ], which is our new Naturals position. We continue to improve on the learning we're seeing coming out of the Naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. We've launched new adjacencies, new [ pulling ] oil mouth sprays in the market with antibacterial benefits, which have been terrific. So we're looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you've seen. 
I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we've had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we've had a significant relaunch underway for the better part of the year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product in terms of a consumer benefit. 
And the third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we're starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning, and we've got more work to do certainly in emerging markets, but we've seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price size architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business. So overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth. You've seen it in organic. And strategically, we think we've got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half or obviously, you had difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated. But we think the strategy is working and the investment that we're putting into that market, as you saw from the release yesterday, is delivering."

Thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we're partnering with retailers to grow category growth, I mean, we're looking to optimize category value, and we have a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly, as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven't pushed more aggressive promotions. But as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically 3 points. And my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization back to the levels that we had historically. But that will be determined. 
This is an emerging market issue more than anything. And the developing -- excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven't seen substantive changes there relative to what we've seen historically. So I think what retailers and both manufacturers are looking for how do we continue to drive growth in the categories. Everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that. And obviously, as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they're looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term. And that's where the innovation comes into play, and we'll continue to bring that to them. So we're being disciplined on it. The revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we're starting to pull away from promotions that don't deliver quality into the category, deliver quality into the P&L for us or our retailers. And you've seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we'll probably see things normalize in the back half of the year. We've planned for that. But again, our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and relaunching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category."

Should we be braced for a more sluggish start to the year? That's the tactical question. And bigger picture, e-com growth, you talked about it a few times. Can you quantify what it is as a percentage of your sales today? How it compares to where you were before?

I think the tactical question is where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021. And I think you're going to see -- obviously, we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You've heard that from others who have announced. And that's, quite frankly, not unexpected. I mean I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus but more importantly, moving into the holiday season. And again, I'm talking U.S. here moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. 
January, the categories have started to come back slightly. But so we're not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we've seen in the categories, whether it's liquid hand soap, dish liquid cleaners, I think, are there to stay for a while, Jason. We'll see those at least -- from a liquid hand standpoint, stay there for the medium, long term. Obviously, as people move back into offices and move away from home, you'll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs. But remember, those 3 categories aren't a significant percentage of our overall sales. So we'll see the categories, I think, sustain higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than '20 as we stated in the first half and then normalize in the back half. 
Coming to e-commerce, again, a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from the outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in e-commerce. And it requires a lot more effort to do that. And the sophistication of dealing effectively in e-commerce is very different. And as if you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it's that same level of focus that we're bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an e-commerce standpoint. The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as John mentioned, we exited the year with e-commerce at a double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company. And you've seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where e-commerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill's. You've seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that and building on that momentum. So we see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we're going to be where consumers are shopping. And we'll see those shifts as we go throughout the year. But the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in e-commerce where we get share, which is not very many places. So we'd know direction, and we still have more upside growth to be had there."

Just trying to understand, as we're looking at the growth for 2021, what comps you really see?"

As I mentioned, broadly, the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year. And as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw, obviously, our shipments accelerate in the back half on Oral Care, particularly in Toothpaste -- and Toothpaste. So as we look to comp that next year, we'll see how the behavior come -- transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we've got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline that we think is good. So we'll see what happens. 
But again, the message here is that understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously, the U.S., being an important part of our toothpaste business, we've seen sluggishness there; strong pipeline, as you talked about, Pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out, and we're starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward. But our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we're bringing. 
Hill's, obviously, the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year. So if I come back to the Hill's strategy, again, it's about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. And we're doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We're bringing great new products into the segment. We were pleased to see the Prescription Diet business start to come back, which I think is a representative of a couple of aspects on that business, which is one. We're seeing people return back to veterinarians and the Prescription Diet business benefiting from that. Our Hill's to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously, the balanced growth we're seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S., which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again, both on the base business as well as Prescription Diet. So we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. 
The comps are difficult, to be sure. But again, remember, this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration and a great, great product offering. So as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending, focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we're bringing both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see, obviously, the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we've had this year. And the category continues to be strong at between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world. And obviously, the new channels that we're experiencing growth, specifically e-commerce, continued to deliver on that. 
So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you'll see in 2021 to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. So comps are tough, and we realize that, but we think we've got good plans in place for 2021."

But if you look at the online world, obviously, the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that the local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking. And so over time, local brands will always be a threat. But I think as you've seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brands, trust and reputation and obviously, as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we'd never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategies and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they're orienting themselves locally based on the insights required to win.

Can you pull apart those puts and takes that John started talking about at the beginning any further? And I guess, my real question underneath that is John had laid out a couple of caveats, raw materials inflation and others, as potentially pressuring gross profit progression as the year progresses. But it didn't sound like you were -- you expected those will be severe enough to actually turn gross margins negative year-over-year, but more simply just govern the expansion. I guess is that the right read? Or does the lower end of your EPS guidance range actually allow for a scenario where gross margins face some actual contraction if some of those uncertainties break the [ long ] line?"

So again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously, we delivered -- coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin, funding the gr",370,"Yes. Thanks, Steve. So again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously, we delivered -- coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin, funding the growth was 280 basis points. And you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately, we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter. And on the year, it was 130 with headwinds of around 230 on the year. So I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets. And that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we'll see in 2021. 
Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021. So we need to ensure, obviously, that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding the growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we're able to compensate that in the market. So the volatility we've seen on raw materials over the years, again, it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity in the revenue growth management initiative -- initiated. But I think the good story that we have, at least we're in a position where we took strong back half advertising -- excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that's based on the current rates that we're seeing. We'll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. So we're mindful of that. We feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input cost that we have and the current spot rates that we're seeing on foreign exchange."

Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health. So we like the dynamics of the category strategically. 
Obviously, post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic stopping and derm offices foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas; foot traffic, obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020. So we started to see -- importantly, in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We spent the year, Lauren -- and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year, we spent the year investing behind those businesses. We weren't taking costs out. We were looking to optimize the cost. We were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses. So we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific. And we think we've set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term, and it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence, the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term. But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again, giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think long term, those categories will perform quite well."

We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business. And we've seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year and in line with the expectations that we have. 
Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China. And pleasingly, we have seen shares grow nicely in online. Again, I think, a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation. And it's interesting index for you. Pre-COVID or pre the relaunch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category. So 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average. So again, clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair Line, like some of the focus that we've done in electric toothbrushes have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. 
Now the brick-and-mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is again the significant changes we've made in some of our go-to-market that's taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID. 
So overall, pleased with the progress that we're making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in e-commerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way."

And that's been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you've heard me talk about quite a few of those today. Obviously, the premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L; our revenue growth management efforts, which translate right through the P&L as well. You saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil, which is certainly bearing fruit; the Personal Care and Home Care leverage that we've seen, obviously, in those categories; and as we expect Oral Care to reaccelerate will drive more leverage through the P&L. Obviously, funding the growth in productivity a real focus for us; great funding the growth in the back half of 2020; a real dialed up orientation behind some opportunities, particularly around our supply chain; and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage. The real cause of that of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and the increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage. And those logistics costs, we hope, will subside in the back half. We're looking at wage continue to optimize our warehousing and trade services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there. But the key driver of it is, again, investing for the long-term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we're seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned, particularly Hill's the U.S., China and as well as India. So overall, we'll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is dropping -- delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continue to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business. So overall, it's about growth, and we'll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that."

Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. 
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.  
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full year performance as well as our 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] 
We finished 2020 in a very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis. Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth; organic growth in all 4 of our categories: Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition; and organic sales growth in every division, with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well. Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.  
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement. We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange. Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in pricing. 
The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind. In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, where we were up 100 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis, where we were up 90 basis points. 
For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 320 basis point headwind, driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 280 basis point benefit.  
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent to sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year. On a base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent to sales basis. This was primarily driven by a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind growth in innovation.  
For the full year, on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points, driven primarily by a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics costs. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year-over-year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis. 
For the full year, our EPS growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis. We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year. As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Florida transaction, with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.  
A few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic. We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our Skin Health businesses in the quarter. Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly, with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales. North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the hum by Colgate electric brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen, our Toothpaste business and Irish Spring.  
Latin America net sales were down low single digits, as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year. Oral Care innovation has been a key growth driver, with Colgate Total Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal and our natural extracts line, all driving incremental growth.  
Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all 3 segments: Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care; and in every hub. Strong Oral Care volume growth on the Colgate and Almex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional media and digital. We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga, where strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel.  
We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, led by volume growth across our biggest hubs: Greater China, India, the Philippines and South Pacific. In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate [ Bed Shocking ] in India and our relaunched Colgate Anti-cavity business across the division. Our Personal Care and Home Care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region.  
Africa/Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all 3 categories and in every hub. Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Total. Marinol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel.  
Hill's finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons. Organic sales growth was again led by the U.S. with e-commerce up significantly, but Europe also delivered double-digit growth. Encouragingly, we are seeing a reacceleration in our Prescription Diet business as that channel traffic continues to improve.  
And now for guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year although we expect currencies to remain volatile. We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
We expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID. Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both a GAAP and base business basis. We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.  
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. On a base business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Obviously, this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year.   
There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range. First, COVID-related consumption. In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year-over-year in 2021 depending on the market. 
However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels. Also, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing. We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment and foreign exchange. 
Raw materials. We have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated. If this continues, it could put pressure on gross margin expansion, depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity. 
Finally, logistics. We have seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S., but also related to shipping containers in Asia. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term, but to moderate later in the year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutula to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced. And obviously we're deeply excited to have him here. He's hit the ground running already. 
As I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed 3 topics related to how we plan to manage through the crisis. These 3 topics were: staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies were necessary and executing with agility; and importantly, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. 
On the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people, and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. 
We worked with the World Health Organization this year and local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of. 
In the second area, we continue to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY; increasing our brand building, globally; and executing against our digital transformation. 
And as John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We're were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizable negative impact from foreign exchange. 
But most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic, managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. 
So now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are 3 reasons. 
The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products. We can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. So we have strengthened existing tools and importantly built new capabilities to drive this growth. 
For example, on Hill's, we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration on what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It's not just spending more but spending smarter. 
In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by 3 points in the last 2 years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management. 
As I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently. And given the Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. 
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line. We need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results, where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. 
We're doing this by pulling on all the levers, premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads and laser-focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement. Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in this -- in the transformational capabilities that were deployed, and that we'll rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively. 
The third reason is we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. 
To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise; launched more online specific innovation like the Optic White Pen, the Miracle Repair serum; and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. And all of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. 
And lastly, it's building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation. Like our transition to SAP S/4HANA, it's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes and simplified transactions. 
We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster. And with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. 
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process. You will remember that was called CBP, that will significantly reduce the process time require while providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. 
So to sum it up, while I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. 
And with that, I'll be happy to take your questions."

So just wanted to understand the balance between pricing and volume in your 3% to 5% organic sales growth outlook. How much pricing you're assuming? And perhaps you can touch on your ability to take further pricing in emerging markets in a weaker dollar environment, and given the state of the consumer. And then in the U.S., the promotional environment also relative to 2020. And the gist of the question is sort of, yes, look, it's a robust organic sales growth outlook relative to last year. So just trying to understand what gives you confidence versus a tough comparison and how pricing plays into that."
262247,701739572,2186311,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dara.

Let me come back again, I guess, overarching in terms of strategy for us because it plays into obviously, our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. And obviously you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories. It certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working. But let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. 
Obviously the refocus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that move through foreign exchange, we've been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market. We've been very focused on delivering revenue growth management discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. 
We've addressed adjacencies in certain markets, which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We've talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up. And obviously the discipline that we've historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction. And you've seen that, particularly in the back half of this year. And so we'll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple of months. 
So again, it's our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. And we see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. 
Relative to your question on the promotional environment. Certainly, we've seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously, we had some low points. But if you take the back half, just as an example, in Toothpaste, we're looking now at running -- the category's running at about 28% to sales on promotion. 
Pre-COVID, it was running 31%, 32%. So it's back to where it was kind of previously. And my sense is there's discipline in the market. We'll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back in the stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece. But right now, it's more disciplined. And we'll continue to manage that going forward. But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we're thinking about premium, core and adjacencies. And then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world. That's allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace."

I think behind the question is kind of where our inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly, following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in the subsequent quarters, second, third and in the fourth. And trade inventories obviously, I think, are well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January. I think as the retailers came out of the Christmas season, they overloaded in some commodity categories, and they're looking to balance it across the board. 
But by and large, we're where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high-demand categories is basically there, and we think we're in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like the liquid hand soap and dish, given the heightened demand. But overall, inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. 
I think what's interesting -- another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world. And that, again, comes back to the point that we've talked about before that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth, getting to where consumers are shopping. 
And the high growth that we've seen obviously in e-commerce and other channels that are nontracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the nontracked are growing at a significant multiple to the track channels today. 
So by and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you've seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building."

I mean, strategically, when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we've seen in categories like oral health and skin health. Let me start with oral health, where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they've begun to embrace telehealth. And what's interesting is go back 2 years, and telehealth was very much nonexistent. 
And obviously COVID has accelerated trends necessary. And the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting. Let's take the new product that we've launched online this year, the hum electric toothbrush, which gives you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you're brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. 
And we see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home. And you can start to piece it together, long-term, how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. 
Likewise, in skin health, the same thing. We're starting to see obviously telehealth expand there. We're seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel as an example, where we've launched a new entry-level skin peel through PCA that we -- that allows us to do more do it at home at -- versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the professional to do that. 
So there's certainly a trend there. We've got people working on that and an opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices."

Obviously volume versus pricing contribution to the top line given that promotion should continue to normalize, and obviously FX turning to a contribution. And then just a little bit of a view in terms of growth by product segment, Oral Care versus Personal Care and Home Care and Hill's. I'm just trying to get a better sense of your level of visibility and where the flex points might be given how much the current environment's evolving. 
And then as you think about what spending is already in the base, particularly for SG&A versus what you're planning for 2021, where do you think the areas are for potential upside and downside?"
262247,701739572,2186311,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","So let's talk a little bit more on the categories.

Obviously, the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when the -- you'll see the categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you've seen, particularly in COVID-related categories like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. 
And our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget, where that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020, but slightly above the, '19 level. So we still expect that we'll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus '19. 
So that's -- but again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent, some markets in Europe, which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. 
You have not seen that in emerging markets. In fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent, Asia, the Middle East, you've seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you've seen in the emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we've seen both in price and volume across our big emerging markets and the growth that's come behind that, which has been terrific. 
So again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we'll see things normalize, and that's built into the current consensus as we -- as John laid out. 
In terms of advertising. Again, strategic for us this year. We talked about it from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we've seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we're seeing significant growth in the category. So let's take the Hill's business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year-end in the fourth quarter. 
And you've obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. And that's a business with a more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration. So the runway ahead of that business, we believe, continues to be very strong, and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we're getting the return on that. 
And likewise, in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we've launched in the back half, the Whitening Pen, the Super Premium Optic White Renewal Toothpaste, some of the work that we're doing on hum online and being much more targeted in that space. 
So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies. So we're quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L."

Noel, I want to spend some time on your emerging markets business, so specifically around category growth and market share momentum and then kind of tie that into your outlook for the year. So obviously really strong performance, and that's been part of the story here, driving the solid results in the back half of the year. Pricing has remained a strong contributor. Everyone kind of understands that with respect to inflation and FX headwinds that the company has been coping with. But I think what's noteworthy is that volume has been quite resilient in the back half of the year, in a way that it wasn't, even despite the fact you're lapping tougher year-over-year comparisons. So I was hoping you could spend a moment, is this sort of the rising tide is raising all boats? Have you observed an acceleration in your categories, perhaps owing to increased consumer mobility related to the pandemic? Or are you seeing very tangible signs of encouraging market share momentum, owing to some of the strategic shifts in spending and investment that you discussed earlier in the call? And if you could just sort of tie that. And also at a high level, what is the company embedding in its 2021 outlook related to emerging markets?"
262247,701739572,2186311,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year, rela",600,"Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year, relative to the comparison on developed. And a lot of the good volume growth we've driven in those markets is, again, comes back to the strategy, more premium innovation where we are underindexed. 
You heard me mention Brazil, where we've increased 3 points in super-premium toothpaste. ASPs are up about 12% in all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now we've given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we've seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points. But the quality of our share and the profitability of our share if that market is far better than it was given the focus on premium innovation. 
The other point that's driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core, focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste business in those markets where we've seen obviously a sluggish market growth. Our shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a track channel issue. Again, driven by good core innovation, taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple of markets. 
And the third would be the adjacency strategy that we've had in emerging markets, whether that's in Africa, whether that's in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion and to have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America as an example behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we've been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies that played out. 
The other piece of this is while depending on where you are, the emerging growth of e-commerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we've seen in emerging, e-commerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously in Asia, the inverse. 
It's a significant growth in the category right now, and we've had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China, behind some of the unique innovation that we put in the market. We'll see how e-commerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases. But if you take the China piece specifically, where we've been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we've seen our market shares in e-commerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategies that we've been deploying. 
So overall, I think we've been looking at the channel growth in the right way. We've been looking at the portfolio strategy from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we'll start to see a reacceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021. And obviously they've been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. So the belief is that in the back half, we'll see that start to stabilize and we'll see markets return, which will give us obviously an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume."

And I just wanted to ask about it in the context, Noel, of your focus on balanced growth. And again, India is a small market, but when I think about kind of some of your other big emerging market businesses, that should be faster growers over the long term, I think, to help you meet your long-term growth algorithm. At what point do you say, ""Wow, a 70% gross margin in an emerging market businesses is too high."" Are there other countries where margins have really been exploding like that? It just struck me as kind of a surprise in the numbers, and I wondered if there was something more to it in terms of how you think about balancing top line versus bottom line growth kind of over the longer term."

Again, coming back to the strategy. India is very focused, likewise, given the strong Oral Care business we have on premiumizing that marketplace. And we've launched premium SKUs in the Vedshakti, which is our new Naturals position. We continue to improve on the learning we're seeing coming out of the Naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. 
We've launched new adjacencies, new pulling oil mouth sprays in the market with antibacterial benefits, which have been terrific. So we're looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you've seen. 
I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we've had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we've had a significant relaunch underway for the better part of the year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product, in terms of a consumer benefit. 
And the third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we're starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning. And we've got more work to do certainly in emerging markets, but we've seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price-size architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business. So overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth. You've seen it in the organic. And strategically, we think we've got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half or obviously had difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated.

And I guess -- and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it sounded to me like you think that these lower promo levels can potentially hold going into 2021 and maybe even beyond. So I guess just maybe for 2021, but also just higher level, did you learn something in 2020 about how much promotion is actually needed to drive growth in your categories? And do you think that these lower levels of promotion can potentially sustain longer term?"

Thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we're partnering with retailers to grow category growth, I mean, we're looking to optimize category value, and we have a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly, as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven't pushed more aggressive promotions. But as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically, 3 points. And my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization back to the levels that we had historically. But that will be determined. 
This is an emerging market issue more than anything. And the developing -- excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven't seen substantive changes there relative to what we've seen historically. So I think what retailers and both manufacturers are looking for how do we continue to drive growth in the categories. Everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that. And obviously as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they're looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term. 
And that's where the innovation comes into play, and we'll continue to bring that to them. So we're being disciplined on it. The revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we're starting to pull away from promotions that don't deliver quality into the category, deliver quality into the P&L for us or our retailers. And you've seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we'll probably see things normalize in the back half of the year. We've planned for that. But again, our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and relaunching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category."

You mentioned a December retail load. You mentioned the comps so -- it was [ to the ] first quarter of pantry stock and expectation of a bit more back half-weighted EM growth story. Should we be braced for a more sluggish start to the year? That's the tactical question. And bigger picture, e-com growth, you talked about it a few times. Can you quantify what it is as a percentage of your sales today? How it compares to where you were before? And how, if at all, you're reimagining your marketing and media approach in the wake of the shift?"

I think the tactical question is where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021. And I think you're going to see -- obviously we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You've heard that from others who have announced. And that's, quite frankly, not unexpected. 
I mean I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus but more importantly, moving into the holiday season. And again, I'm talking U.S. here, moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. 
January, the categories have started to come back slightly. But so we're not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we've seen in the categories, whether it's liquid hand soap, or dish liquid cleaners, I think, are there to stay for a while, Jason. We'll see those at least -- from a liquid hand standpoint, stay there for the medium, long term. Obviously as people move back into offices and move away from home, you'll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs. But remember, those 3 categories aren't a significant percentage of our overall sales. So we'll see the categories, I think, sustain higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than '20 as we stated in the first half and then normalize in the back half. 
Coming to e-commerce. Again, a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from the outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in e-commerce. And it requires a lot more effort to do that. And the sophistication of dealing effectively in e-commerce is very different. And as if you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it's that same level of focus that we're bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an e-commerce standpoint. 
The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously as John mentioned, we exited the year with e-commerce at a double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company. And you've seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where e-commerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill's. You've seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that and building on that momentum. 
So we see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we're going to be where consumers are shopping. And we'll see those shifts as we go throughout the year. But the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in e-commerce where we get share, which is not very many places. So we'd know direction, and we still have more upside growth to be had there."

And so on a full year basis, the comps aren't really that different. Is that fair? And then on pet, I don't have a good idea just because vet centers were closed. So didn't know if you felt like the business ran at full capacity throughout the year at f5% capacity. Just trying to understand, as we're looking at the growth for 2021, what comps you really see?"

As I mentioned, broadly, the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year. And as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw, obviously, our shipments accelerate in the back half on Oral Care, particularly in Toothpaste -- and Toothpaste. So as we look to comp that next year, we'll see how the behavior come -- transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we've got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline that we think is good. So we'll see what happens. 
But again, the message here is that understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously, the U.S., being an important part of our toothpaste business, we've seen sluggishness there; strong pipeline, as you talked about, Pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out, and we're starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward. But our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we're bringing. 
Hill's, obviously the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year. So if I come back to the Hill's strategy, again, it's about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. And we're doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We're bringing great new products into the segment. We were pleased to see the Prescription Diet business start to come back, which I think is a representative of a couple of aspects on that business, which is one, we're seeing people return back to veterinarians and the Prescription Diet business benefiting from that. Our Hill's to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously the balanced growth we're seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S., which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again, both on the base business as well as Prescription Diet. So we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. 
The comps are difficult, to be sure. But again, remember, this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration and a great, great product offering. So as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending, focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we're bringing both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see, obviously, the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we've had this year. And the category continues to be strong at between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world. And obviously, the new channels that we're experiencing growth, specifically e-commerce, continued to deliver on that. 
So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you'll see in 2021 to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. So our comps are tough, and we realize that, but we think we've got good plans in place for 2021."

And obviously the importance of health and hygiene and trust played into that resurgence. And ultimately, as consumers move back in to stores and you get the benefit of displays, you will see perhaps some of the local brands reorient themselves and get some benefit of that. But if you look at the online world, obviously, the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that the local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking. And so over time, local brands will always be a threat. But I think as you've seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brands, trust and reputation and obviously, as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we'd never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategies and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they're orienting themselves locally based on the insights required to win. And we feel like the innovation structure that we put in place around the world, in terms of our focus on H1, H2 and H3 and being more local or required, will hopefully address those increasing challenges that we'll see as foot traffic increases in the back half."

And I guess, my real question underneath that is John had laid out a couple of caveats, raw materials inflation and others, as potentially pressuring gross profit progression as the year progresses. But it didn't sound like you were -- you expected those will be severe enough to actually turn gross margins negative year-over-year, but more simply just govern the expansion. I guess is that the right read? Or does the lower end of your EPS guidance range actually allow for a scenario where gross margins face some actual contraction if some of those uncertainties break the long line?"

So again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously we delivered -- coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin, funding the growth was 280 basis points. And you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately, we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter. And on the year, it was 130 with headwinds of around 230 on the year. So I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets. And that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we'll see in 2021. 
Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021. So we need to ensure obviously that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding the growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we're able to compensate that in the market. So the volatility we've seen on raw materials over the years, again, it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity in the revenue growth management initiative -- initiated. 
But I think the good story that we have, at least we're in a position where we took strong back half advertising -- excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that's based on the current rates that we're seeing. We'll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. So we're mindful of that. We feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input cost that we have and the current spot rates that we're seeing on foreign exchange."

Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health. So we like the dynamics of the category strategically. 
Obviously post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic stopping and derm offices. Foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas; foot traffic, obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020. So we started to see -- importantly, in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We spent the year, Lauren -- and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year. We spent the year investing behind those businesses. 
We weren't taking costs out. We were looking to optimize the cost. We were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses. So we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific. And we think we've set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term. 
And it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence, the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term. But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again, giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think long term, those categories will perform quite well."

We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business. And we've seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year and in line with the expectations that we have. 
Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China. And pleasingly, we have seen shares grow nicely in online. Again, I think, a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation. And it's interesting index for you. Pre-COVID or pre -- the relaunch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category, so 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average. So again, clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business, delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair Line, like some of the focus that we've done in electric toothbrushes, have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. 
Now the brick-and-mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is again the significant changes we've made in some of our go-to-market that's taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID. 
So overall, pleased with the progress that we're making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in e-commerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way."

And that's been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you've heard me talk about quite a few of those today. 
Obviously the premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L; our revenue growth management efforts, which translate right through the P&L as well. You saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil, which is certainly bearing fruit; the Personal Care and Home Care leverage that we've seen, obviously, in those categories; and as we expect Oral Care to reaccelerate will drive more leverage through the P&L. Obviously funding the growth in productivity a real focus for us; great funding the growth in the back half of 2020; a real dialed up orientation behind some opportunities, particularly around our supply chain; and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage. 
The real cause of that of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and the increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage. And those logistics costs, we hope, will subside in the back half. We're looking at wage continue to optimize our warehousing and trade services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there. 
But the key driver of it is, again, investing for the long-term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we're seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned, particularly Hill's the U.S., China and as well as India. So overall, we'll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is dropping -- delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continue to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business. So overall, it's about growth, and we'll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that."

Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. 
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.  
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full year performance as well as our 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] 
We finished 2020 in a very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis. Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth; organic growth in all 4 of our categories: Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition; and organic sales growth in every division, with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well. Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.  
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement. We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange. Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in pricing. 
The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind. In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, where we were up 100 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis, where we were up 90 basis points. 
For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 320 basis point headwind, driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 280 basis point benefit.  
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent to sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year. On a base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent to sales basis. This was primarily driven by a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind growth in innovation.  
For the full year, on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points, driven primarily by a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics costs. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year-over-year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis. 
For the full year, our EPS growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis. We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year. As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Florida transaction, with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.  
A few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic. We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our Skin Health businesses in the quarter. Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly, with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales. North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the hum by Colgate electric brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen, our Toothpaste business and Irish Spring.  
Latin America net sales were down low single digits, as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year. Oral Care innovation has been a key growth driver, with Colgate Total Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal and our natural extracts line, all driving incremental growth.  
Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all 3 segments: Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care; and in every hub. Strong Oral Care volume growth on the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional media and digital. We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga, where strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel.  
We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, led by volume growth across our biggest hubs: Greater China, India, the Philippines and South Pacific. In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate [ Bed Shocking ] in India and our relaunched Colgate Anti-cavity business across the division. Our Personal Care and Home Care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region.  
Africa/Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all 3 categories and in every hub. Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Total. Marinol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel.  
Hill's finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons. Organic sales growth was again led by the U.S. with e-commerce up significantly, but Europe also delivered double-digit growth. Encouragingly, we are seeing a reacceleration in our Prescription Diet business as that channel traffic continues to improve.  
And now for guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year although we expect currencies to remain volatile. We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
We expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID. Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both a GAAP and base business basis. We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.  
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. On a base business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Obviously, this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year.   
There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range. First, COVID-related consumption. In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year-over-year in 2021 depending on the market. 
However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels. Also, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing. We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment and foreign exchange. 
Raw materials. We have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated. If this continues, it could put pressure on gross margin expansion, depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity. 
Finally, logistics. We have seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S., but also related to shipping containers in Asia. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term, but to moderate later in the year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutula to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced. And obviously we're deeply excited to have him here. He's hit the ground running already. 
As I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed 3 topics related to how we plan to manage through the crisis. These 3 topics were: staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies were necessary and executing with agility; and importantly, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. 
On the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people, and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. 
We worked with the World Health Organization this year and local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of. 
In the second area, we continue to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY; increasing our brand building, globally; and executing against our digital transformation. 
And as John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We're were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizable negative impact from foreign exchange. 
But most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic, managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. 
So now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are 3 reasons. 
The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products. We can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. So we have strengthened existing tools and importantly built new capabilities to drive this growth. 
For example, on Hill's, we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration on what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It's not just spending more but spending smarter. 
In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by 3 points in the last 2 years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management. 
As I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently. And given the Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. 
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line. We need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results, where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. 
We're doing this by pulling on all the levers, premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads and laser-focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement. Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in this -- in the transformational capabilities that were deployed, and that we'll rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively. 
The third reason is we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. 
To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise; launched more online specific innovation like the Optic White Pen, the Miracle Repair serum; and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. And all of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. 
And lastly, it's building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation. Like our transition to SAP S/4HANA, it's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes and simplified transactions. 
We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster. And with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. 
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process. You will remember that was called CBP, that will significantly reduce the process time require while providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. 
So to sum it up, while I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. 
And with that, I'll be happy to take your questions."

You mentioned optimism on pricing for 2021, also mentioned the rising raw material environment, clearly. So just wanted to understand the balance between pricing and volume in your 3% to 5% organic sales growth outlook. How much pricing you're assuming? And perhaps you can touch on your ability to take further pricing in emerging markets in a weaker dollar environment, and given the state of the consumer. And then in the U.S., the promotional environment also relative to 2020. And the gist of the question is sort of, yes, look, it's a robust organic sales growth outlook relative to last year. So just trying to understand what gives you confidence versus a tough comparison and how pricing plays into that."

Let me come back again, I guess, overarching in terms of strategy for us because it plays into obviously, our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. And obviously you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories. It certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working. But let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. 
Obviously the refocus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that move through foreign exchange, we've been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market. We've been very focused on delivering revenue growth management discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. 
We've addressed adjacencies in certain markets, which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We've talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up. And obviously the discipline that we've historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction. And you've seen that, particularly in the back half of this year. And so we'll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple of months. 
So again, it's our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. And we see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. 
Relative to your question on the promotional environment. Certainly, we've seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously, we had some low points. But if you take the back half, just as an example, in Toothpaste, we're looking now at running -- the category's running at about 28% to sales on promotion. 
Pre-COVID, it was running 31%, 32%. So it's back to where it was kind of previously. And my sense is there's discipline in the market. We'll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back in the stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece. But right now, it's more disciplined. And we'll continue to manage that going forward. But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we're thinking about premium, core and adjacencies. And then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world. That's allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace."

So as we look in into 2021, how we should be thinking as you see your outlook for volumes?"
262247,701739572,2253223,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. 2 aspects there.

I think behind the question is kind of where our inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly, following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in the subsequent quarters, second, third and in the fourth. And trade inventories obviously, I think, are well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January. I think as the retailers came out of the Christmas season, they overloaded in some commodity categories, and they're looking to balance it across the board. 
But by and large, we're where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high-demand categories is basically there, and we think we're in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like the liquid hand soap and dish, given the heightened demand. But overall, inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. 
I think what's interesting -- another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world. And that, again, comes back to the point that we've talked about before that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth, getting to where consumers are shopping. 
And the high growth that we've seen obviously in e-commerce and other channels that are nontracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the nontracked are growing at a significant multiple to the track channels today. 
So by and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you've seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building."

I mean, strategically, when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we've seen in categories like oral health and skin health. Let me start with oral health, where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they've begun to embrace telehealth. And what's interesting is go back 2 years, and telehealth was very much nonexistent. 
And obviously COVID has accelerated trends necessary. And the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting. Let's take the new product that we've launched online this year, the hum electric toothbrush, which gives you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you're brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. 
And we see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home. And you can start to piece it together, long-term, how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. 
Likewise, in skin health, the same thing. We're starting to see obviously telehealth expand there. We're seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel as an example, where we've launched a new entry-level skin peel through PCA that we -- that allows us to do more do it at home at -- versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the professional to do that. 
So there's certainly a trend there. We've got people working on that and an opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices."

Obviously volume versus pricing contribution to the top line given that promotion should continue to normalize, and obviously FX turning to a contribution. And then just a little bit of a view in terms of growth by product segment, Oral Care versus Personal Care and Home Care and Hill's. I'm just trying to get a better sense of your level of visibility and where the flex points might be given how much the current environment's evolving. 
And then as you think about what spending is already in the base, particularly for SG&A versus what you're planning for 2021, where do you think the areas are for potential upside and downside?"
262247,701739572,2253223,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","So let's talk a little bit more on the categories.

Obviously, the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when the -- you'll see the categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you've seen, particularly in COVID-related categories like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. 
And our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget, where that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020, but slightly above the, '19 level. So we still expect that we'll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus '19. 
So that's -- but again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent, some markets in Europe, which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. 
You have not seen that in emerging markets. In fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent, Asia, the Middle East, you've seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you've seen in the emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we've seen both in price and volume across our big emerging markets and the growth that's come behind that, which has been terrific. 
So again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we'll see things normalize, and that's built into the current consensus as we -- as John laid out. 
In terms of advertising. Again, strategic for us this year. We talked about it from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we've seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we're seeing significant growth in the category. So let's take the Hill's business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year-end in the fourth quarter. 
And you've obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. And that's a business with a more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration. So the runway ahead of that business, we believe, continues to be very strong, and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we're getting the return on that. 
And likewise, in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we've launched in the back half, the Whitening Pen, the Super Premium Optic White Renewal Toothpaste, some of the work that we're doing on hum online and being much more targeted in that space. 
So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies. So we're quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L."

Noel, I want to spend some time on your emerging markets business, so specifically around category growth and market share momentum and then kind of tie that into your outlook for the year. So obviously really strong performance, and that's been part of the story here, driving the solid results in the back half of the year. Pricing has remained a strong contributor. Everyone kind of understands that with respect to inflation and FX headwinds that the company has been coping with. But I think what's noteworthy is that volume has been quite resilient in the back half of the year, in a way that it wasn't, even despite the fact you're lapping tougher year-over-year comparisons. 
So I was hoping you could spend a moment, is this sort of the rising tide is raising all boats? Have you observed an acceleration in your categories, perhaps owing to increased consumer mobility related to the pandemic? Or are you seeing very tangible signs of encouraging market share momentum, owing to some of the strategic shifts in spending and investment that you discussed earlier in the call? And if you could just sort of tie that. And also at a high level, what is the company embedding in its 2021 outlook related to emerging markets?"
262247,701739572,2253223,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year, rela",600,"Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year, relative to the comparison on developed. And a lot of the good volume growth we've driven in those markets is, again, comes back to the strategy, more premium innovation where we are underindexed. 
You heard me mention Brazil, where we've increased 3 points in super-premium toothpaste. ASPs are up about 12% in all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now we've given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we've seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points. But the quality of our share and the profitability of our share if that market is far better than it was given the focus on premium innovation. 
The other point that's driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core, focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste business in those markets where we've seen obviously a sluggish market growth. Our shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a track channel issue. Again, driven by good core innovation, taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple of markets. 
And the third would be the adjacency strategy that we've had in emerging markets, whether that's in Africa, whether that's in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion and to have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America as an example behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we've been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies that played out. 
The other piece of this is while depending on where you are, the emerging growth of e-commerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we've seen in emerging, e-commerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously in Asia, the inverse. 
It's a significant growth in the category right now, and we've had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China, behind some of the unique innovation that we put in the market. We'll see how e-commerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases. But if you take the China piece specifically, where we've been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we've seen our market shares in e-commerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategies that we've been deploying. 
So overall, I think we've been looking at the channel growth in the right way. We've been looking at the portfolio strategy from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we'll start to see a reacceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021. And obviously they've been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. So the belief is that in the back half, we'll see that start to stabilize and we'll see markets return, which will give us obviously an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume."

And it -- obviously the exception that we actually get to see numbers for a specific country for you. And I know it's small, but the thing that struck me was top line growth was good but not great, but margin expansion was huge, off the charts. And gross margin, I think, in India is now north of 70%. And I just wanted to ask about it in the context, Noel, of your focus on balanced growth. And again, India is a small market, but when I think about kind of some of your other big emerging market businesses, that should be faster growers over the long term, I think, to help you meet your long-term growth algorithm. At what point do you say, ""Wow, a 70% gross margin in an emerging market businesses is too high."" Are there other countries where margins have really been exploding like that? It just struck me as kind of a surprise in the numbers, and I wondered if there was something more to it in terms of how you think about balancing top line versus bottom line growth kind of over the longer term."

We were very pleased with the rebound in the growth that we saw in the back half of 2020, given some of the COVID issues experienced in the first quarter leading to lockdowns at the back end of that quarter and into the second quarter, generating 7% organic in the third and just shy of 10% organic in the fourth, we think, is a terrific performance. 
Again, coming back to the strategy. India is very focused, likewise, given the strong Oral Care business we have on premiumizing that marketplace. And we've launched premium SKUs in the Vedshakti, which is our new Naturals position. We continue to improve on the learning we're seeing coming out of the Naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. 
We've launched new adjacencies, new pulling oil mouth sprays in the market with antibacterial benefits, which have been terrific. So we're looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you've seen. 
I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we've had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we've had a significant relaunch underway for the better part of the year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product, in terms of a consumer benefit. 
And the third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we're starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning. And we've got more work to do certainly in emerging markets, but we've seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price-size architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business. So overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth. You've seen it in the organic. And strategically, we think we've got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half or obviously had difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated.

Thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we're partnering with retailers to grow category growth, I mean, we're looking to optimize category value, and we have a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly, as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven't pushed more aggressive promotions. But as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically, 3 points. And my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization back to the levels that we had historically. But that will be determined. 
This is an emerging market issue more than anything. And the developing -- excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven't seen substantive changes there relative to what we've seen historically. So I think what retailers and both manufacturers are looking for how do we continue to drive growth in the categories. Everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that. And obviously as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they're looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term. 
And that's where the innovation comes into play, and we'll continue to bring that to them. So we're being disciplined on it. The revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we're starting to pull away from promotions that don't deliver quality into the category, deliver quality into the P&L for us or our retailers. And you've seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we'll probably see things normalize in the back half of the year. We've planned for that. But again, our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and relaunching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category."

Should we be braced for a more sluggish start to the year? That's the tactical question. And bigger picture, e-com growth, you talked about it a few times. Can you quantify what it is as a percentage of your sales today? How it compares to where you were before? And how, if at all, you're reimagining your marketing and media approach in the wake of the shift?"

I think the tactical question is where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021. And I think you're going to see -- obviously we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You've heard that from others who have announced. And that's, quite frankly, not unexpected. 
I mean I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus but more importantly, moving into the holiday season. And again, I'm talking U.S. here, moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. 
January, the categories have started to come back slightly. But so we're not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we've seen in the categories, whether it's liquid hand soap, or dish liquid cleaners, I think, are there to stay for a while, Jason. We'll see those at least -- from a liquid hand standpoint, stay there for the medium, long term. Obviously as people move back into offices and move away from home, you'll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs. But remember, those 3 categories aren't a significant percentage of our overall sales. So we'll see the categories, I think, sustain higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than '20 as we stated in the first half and then normalize in the back half. 
Coming to e-commerce. Again, a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from the outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in e-commerce. And it requires a lot more effort to do that. And the sophistication of dealing effectively in e-commerce is very different. And as if you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it's that same level of focus that we're bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an e-commerce standpoint. 
The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously as John mentioned, we exited the year with e-commerce at a double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company. And you've seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where e-commerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill's. You've seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that and building on that momentum. 
So we see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we're going to be where consumers are shopping. And we'll see those shifts as we go throughout the year. But the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in e-commerce where we get share, which is not very many places. So we'd know direction, and we still have more upside growth to be had there."

So didn't know if you felt like the business ran at full capacity throughout the year at f5% capacity. Just trying to understand, as we're looking at the growth for 2021, what comps you really see?"

As I mentioned, broadly, the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year. And as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw, obviously, our shipments accelerate in the back half on Oral Care, particularly in Toothpaste -- and Toothpaste. So as we look to comp that next year, we'll see how the behavior come -- transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we've got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline that we think is good. So we'll see what happens. 
But again, the message here is that understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously, the U.S., being an important part of our toothpaste business, we've seen sluggishness there; strong pipeline, as you talked about, Pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out, and we're starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward. But our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we're bringing. 
Hill's, obviously the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year. So if I come back to the Hill's strategy, again, it's about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. And we're doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We're bringing great new products into the segment. We were pleased to see the Prescription Diet business start to come back, which I think is a representative of a couple of aspects on that business, which is one, we're seeing people return back to veterinarians and the Prescription Diet business benefiting from that. Our Hill's to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously the balanced growth we're seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S., which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again, both on the base business as well as Prescription Diet. So we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. 
The comps are difficult, to be sure. But again, remember, this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration and a great, great product offering. So as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending, focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we're bringing both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see, obviously, the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we've had this year. And the category continues to be strong at between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world. And obviously, the new channels that we're experiencing growth, specifically e-commerce, continued to deliver on that. 
So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you'll see in 2021 to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. So our comps are tough, and we realize that, but we think we've got good plans in place for 2021."

And obviously the importance of health and hygiene and trust played into that resurgence. And ultimately, as consumers move back in to stores and you get the benefit of displays, you will see perhaps some of the local brands reorient themselves and get some benefit of that. But if you look at the online world, obviously, the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that the local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking. And so over time, local brands will always be a threat. 
But I think as you've seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brands, trust and reputation and obviously, as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we'd never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategies and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they're orienting themselves locally based on the insights required to win. And we feel like the innovation structure that we put in place around the world, in terms of our focus on H1, H2 and H3 and being more local or required, will hopefully address those increasing challenges that we'll see as foot traffic increases in the back half."

Can you pull apart those puts and takes that John started talking about at the beginning any further? And I guess, my real question underneath that is John had laid out a couple of caveats, raw materials inflation and others, as potentially pressuring gross profit progression as the year progresses. But it didn't sound like you were -- you expected those will be severe enough to actually turn gross margins negative year-over-year, but more simply just govern the expansion. I guess is that the right read? Or does the lower end of your EPS guidance range actually allow for a scenario where gross margins face some actual contraction if some of those uncertainties break the long line?"

So again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously we delivered -- coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin, funding the growth was 280 basis points. And you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately, we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter. And on the year, it was 130 with headwinds of around 230 on the year. So I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets. And that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we'll see in 2021. 
Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021. So we need to ensure obviously that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding the growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we're able to compensate that in the market. So the volatility we've seen on raw materials over the years, again, it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity in the revenue growth management initiative -- initiated. 
But I think the good story that we have, at least we're in a position where we took strong back half advertising -- excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that's based on the current rates that we're seeing. We'll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. So we're mindful of that. We feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input cost that we have and the current spot rates that we're seeing on foreign exchange."

Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health. So we like the dynamics of the category strategically. 
Obviously post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic stopping and derm offices. Foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas; foot traffic, obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020. So we started to see -- importantly, in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We spent the year, Lauren -- and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year. We spent the year investing behind those businesses. 
We weren't taking costs out. We were looking to optimize the cost. We were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses. So we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific. And we think we've set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term. 
And it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence, the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term. But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again, giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think long term, those categories will perform quite well."

As we alluded to, we expected performance in 2019 to improve in the back half based on those strategies, which it did. We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business. And we've seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year and in line with the expectations that we have. 
Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China. And pleasingly, we have seen shares grow nicely in online. Again, I think, a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation. And it's interesting index for you. Pre-COVID or pre -- the relaunch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category, so 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average. So again, clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business, delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair Line, like some of the focus that we've done in electric toothbrushes, have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. 
Now the brick-and-mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is again the significant changes we've made in some of our go-to-market that's taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID. 
So overall, pleased with the progress that we're making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in e-commerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way."

And that's been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you've heard me talk about quite a few of those today. 
Obviously the premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L; our revenue growth management efforts, which translate right through the P&L as well. You saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil, which is certainly bearing fruit; the Personal Care and Home Care leverage that we've seen, obviously, in those categories; and as we expect Oral Care to reaccelerate will drive more leverage through the P&L. Obviously funding the growth in productivity a real focus for us; great funding the growth in the back half of 2020; a real dialed up orientation behind some opportunities, particularly around our supply chain; and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage. 
The real cause of that of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and the increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage. And those logistics costs, we hope, will subside in the back half. We're looking at wage continue to optimize our warehousing and trade services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there. 
But the key driver of it is, again, investing for the long-term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we're seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned, particularly Hill's the U.S., China and as well as India. So overall, we'll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is dropping -- delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continue to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business. So overall, it's about growth, and we'll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that."

Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. 
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.  
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full year performance as well as our 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] 
We finished 2020 in a very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis. Importantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth; organic growth in all 4 of our categories: Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition; and organic sales growth in every division, with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well. Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.  
Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement. We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange. Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in pricing. 
The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind. In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, where we were up 100 basis points year-over-year, and a base business basis, where we were up 90 basis points. 
For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 320 basis point headwind, driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 280 basis point benefit.  
On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent to sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year. On a base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent to sales basis. This was primarily driven by a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind growth in innovation.  
For the full year, on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points, driven primarily by a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics costs. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year-over-year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis. 
For the full year, our EPS growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis. We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year. As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Florida transaction, with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.  
A few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic. We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our Skin Health businesses in the quarter. Our e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly, with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales. North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the hum by Colgate electric brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen, our Toothpaste business and Irish Spring.  
Latin America net sales were down low single digits, as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year. Oral Care innovation has been a key growth driver, with Colgate Total Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal and our natural extracts line, all driving incremental growth.  
Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all 3 segments: Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care; and in every hub. Strong Oral Care volume growth on the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional media and digital. We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga, where strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel.  
We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, led by volume growth across our biggest hubs: Greater China, India, the Philippines and South Pacific. In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate [ Bed Shocking ] in India and our relaunched Colgate Anti-cavity business across the division. Our Personal Care and Home Care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region.  
Africa/Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all 3 categories and in every hub. Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Total. Marinol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel.  
Hill's finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons. Organic sales growth was again led by the U.S. with e-commerce up significantly, but Europe also delivered double-digit growth. Encouragingly, we are seeing a reacceleration in our Prescription Diet business as that channel traffic continues to improve.  
And now for guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year although we expect currencies to remain volatile. We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
We expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID. Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both a GAAP and base business basis. We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.  
On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. On a base business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Obviously, this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year.   
There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range. First, COVID-related consumption. In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year-over-year in 2021 depending on the market. 
However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels. Also, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing. We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment and foreign exchange. 
Raw materials. We have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated. If this continues, it could put pressure on gross margin expansion, depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity. 
Finally, logistics. We have seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S., but also related to shipping containers in Asia. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term, but to moderate later in the year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutula to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced. And obviously we're deeply excited to have him here. He's hit the ground running already. 
As I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed 3 topics related to how we plan to manage through the crisis. These 3 topics were: staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies were necessary and executing with agility; and importantly, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. 
On the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people, and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. 
We worked with the World Health Organization this year and local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of. 
In the second area, we continue to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY; increasing our brand building, globally; and executing against our digital transformation. 
And as John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We're were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizable negative impact from foreign exchange. 
But most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic, managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. 
So now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are 3 reasons. 
The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products. We can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. So we have strengthened existing tools and importantly built new capabilities to drive this growth. 
For example, on Hill's, we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration on what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It's not just spending more but spending smarter. 
In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by 3 points in the last 2 years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management. 
As I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Superior performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently. And given the Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. 
The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line. We need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results, where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. 
We're doing this by pulling on all the levers, premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads and laser-focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement. Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in this -- in the transformational capabilities that were deployed, and that we'll rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively. 
The third reason is we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. 
To that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise; launched more online specific innovation like the Optic White Pen, the Miracle Repair serum; and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. And all of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. 
And lastly, it's building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation. Like our transition to SAP S/4HANA, it's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes and simplified transactions. 
We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster. And with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. 
We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process. You will remember that was called CBP, that will significantly reduce the process time require while providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. 
So to sum it up, while I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. 
And with that, I'll be happy to take your questions."

You mentioned optimism on pricing for 2021, also mentioned the rising raw material environment, clearly. So just wanted to understand the balance between pricing and volume in your 3% to 5% organic sales growth outlook. How much pricing you're assuming? And perhaps you can touch on your ability to take further pricing in emerging markets in a weaker dollar environment, and given the state of the consumer. And then in the U.S., the promotional environment also relative to 2020. And the gist of the question is sort of, yes, look, it's a robust organic sales growth outlook relative to last year. So just trying to understand what gives you confidence versus a tough comparison and how pricing plays into that."
262247,701739572,2253226,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Dara.

Let me come back again, I guess, overarching in terms of strategy for us because it plays into obviously, our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. And obviously you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories. It certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working. But let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. 
Obviously the refocus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that move through foreign exchange, we've been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market. We've been very focused on delivering revenue growth management discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. 
We've addressed adjacencies in certain markets, which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We've talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up. And obviously the discipline that we've historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction. And you've seen that, particularly in the back half of this year. And so we'll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple of months. 
So again, it's our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. And we see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. 
Relative to your question on the promotional environment. Certainly, we've seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously, we had some low points. But if you take the back half, just as an example, in Toothpaste, we're looking now at running -- the category's running at about 28% to sales on promotion. 
Pre-COVID, it was running 31%, 32%. So it's back to where it was kind of previously. And my sense is there's discipline in the market. We'll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back in the stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece. But right now, it's more disciplined. And we'll continue to manage that going forward. But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we're thinking about premium, core and adjacencies. And then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world. That's allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace."

So as we look in into 2021, how we should be thinking as you see your outlook for volumes?"
262247,701739572,2253226,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. 2 aspects there.

I think behind the question is kind of where our inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly, following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in the subsequent quarters, second, third and in the fourth. And trade inventories obviously, I think, are well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January. I think as the retailers came out of the Christmas season, they overloaded in some commodity categories, and they're looking to balance it across the board. 
But by and large, we're where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high-demand categories is basically there, and we think we're in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like the liquid hand soap and dish, given the heightened demand. But overall, inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. 
I think what's interesting -- another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world. And that, again, comes back to the point that we've talked about before that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth, getting to where consumers are shopping. 
And the high growth that we've seen obviously in e-commerce and other channels that are nontracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the nontracked are growing at a significant multiple to the track channels today. 
So by and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you've seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building."

I mean, strategically, when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we've seen in categories like oral health and skin health. Let me start with oral health, where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they've begun to embrace telehealth. And what's interesting is go back 2 years, and telehealth was very much nonexistent. 
And obviously COVID has accelerated trends necessary. And the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting. Let's take the new product that we've launched online this year, the hum electric toothbrush, which gives you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you're brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. 
And we see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home. And you can start to piece it together, long-term, how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. 
Likewise, in skin health, the same thing. We're starting to see obviously telehealth expand there. We're seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel as an example, where we've launched a new entry-level skin peel through PCA that we -- that allows us to do more do it at home at -- versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the professional to do that. 
So there's certainly a trend there. We've got people working on that and an opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices."

Obviously volume versus pricing contribution to the top line given that promotion should continue to normalize, and obviously FX turning to a contribution. And then just a little bit of a view in terms of growth by product segment, Oral Care versus Personal Care and Home Care and Hill's. I'm just trying to get a better sense of your level of visibility and where the flex points might be given how much the current environment's evolving. 
And then as you think about what spending is already in the base, particularly for SG&A versus what you're planning for 2021, where do you think the areas are for potential upside and downside?"
262247,701739572,2253226,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","So let's talk a little bit more on the categories.

Obviously, the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when the -- you'll see the categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you've seen, particularly in COVID-related categories like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. 
And our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget, where that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020, but slightly above the, '19 level. So we still expect that we'll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus '19. 
So that's -- but again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent, some markets in Europe, which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. 
You have not seen that in emerging markets. In fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent, Asia, the Middle East, you've seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you've seen in the emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we've seen both in price and volume across our big emerging markets and the growth that's come behind that, which has been terrific. 
So again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we'll see things normalize, and that's built into the current consensus as we -- as John laid out. 
In terms of advertising. Again, strategic for us this year. We talked about it from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we've seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we're seeing significant growth in the category. So let's take the Hill's business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year-end in the fourth quarter. 
And you've obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. And that's a business with a more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration. So the runway ahead of that business, we believe, continues to be very strong, and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we're getting the return on that. 
And likewise, in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we've launched in the back half, the Whitening Pen, the Super Premium Optic White Renewal Toothpaste, some of the work that we're doing on hum online and being much more targeted in that space. 
So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies. So we're quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L."

Noel, I want to spend some time on your emerging markets business, so specifically around category growth and market share momentum and then kind of tie that into your outlook for the year. So obviously really strong performance, and that's been part of the story here, driving the solid results in the back half of the year. Pricing has remained a strong contributor. Everyone kind of understands that with respect to inflation and FX headwinds that the company has been coping with. But I think what's noteworthy is that volume has been quite resilient in the back half of the year, in a way that it wasn't, even despite the fact you're lapping tougher year-over-year comparisons. 
So I was hoping you could spend a moment, is this sort of the rising tide is raising all boats? Have you observed an acceleration in your categories, perhaps owing to increased consumer mobility related to the pandemic? Or are you seeing very tangible signs of encouraging market share momentum, owing to some of the strategic shifts in spending and investment that you discussed earlier in the call? And if you could just sort of tie that. And also at a high level, what is the company embedding in its 2021 outlook related to emerging markets?"
262247,701739572,2253226,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year, rela",600,"Sure. A lot packed in that question. Let me try to get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year, relative to the comparison on developed. And a lot of the good volume growth we've driven in those markets is, again, comes back to the strategy, more premium innovation where we are underindexed. 
You heard me mention Brazil, where we've increased 3 points in super-premium toothpaste. ASPs are up about 12% in all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now we've given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we've seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points. But the quality of our share and the profitability of our share if that market is far better than it was given the focus on premium innovation. 
The other point that's driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core, focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste business in those markets where we've seen obviously a sluggish market growth. Our shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a track channel issue. Again, driven by good core innovation, taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple of markets. 
And the third would be the adjacency strategy that we've had in emerging markets, whether that's in Africa, whether that's in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion and to have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America as an example behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we've been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies that played out. 
The other piece of this is while depending on where you are, the emerging growth of e-commerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we've seen in emerging, e-commerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously in Asia, the inverse. 
It's a significant growth in the category right now, and we've had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China, behind some of the unique innovation that we put in the market. We'll see how e-commerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases. But if you take the China piece specifically, where we've been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we've seen our market shares in e-commerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategies that we've been deploying. 
So overall, I think we've been looking at the channel growth in the right way. We've been looking at the portfolio strategy from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we'll start to see a reacceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021. And obviously they've been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. So the belief is that in the back half, we'll see that start to stabilize and we'll see markets return, which will give us obviously an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume."

And I just wanted to ask about it in the context, Noel, of your focus on balanced growth. And again, India is a small market, but when I think about kind of some of your other big emerging market businesses, that should be faster growers over the long term, I think, to help you meet your long-term growth algorithm. At what point do you say, ""Wow, a 70% gross margin in an emerging market businesses is too high."" Are there other countries where margins have really been exploding like that? It just struck me as kind of a surprise in the numbers, and I wondered if there was something more to it in terms of how you think about balancing top line versus bottom line growth kind of over the longer term."

Again, coming back to the strategy. India is very focused, likewise, given the strong Oral Care business we have on premiumizing that marketplace. And we've launched premium SKUs in the Vedshakti, which is our new Naturals position. We continue to improve on the learning we're seeing coming out of the Naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. 
We've launched new adjacencies, new pulling oil mouth sprays in the market with antibacterial benefits, which have been terrific. So we're looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you've seen. 
I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we've had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we've had a significant relaunch underway for the better part of the year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product, in terms of a consumer benefit. 
And the third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we're starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning. And we've got more work to do certainly in emerging markets, but we've seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price-size architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business. So overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth. You've seen it in the organic. And strategically, we think we've got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half or obviously had difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated. But we think the strategy is working and the investment that we're putting into that market, as you saw from the release yesterday, is delivering."

Thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we're partnering with retailers to grow category growth, I mean, we're looking to optimize category value, and we have a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly, as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven't pushed more aggressive promotions. But as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically, 3 points. And my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization back to the levels that we had historically. But that will be determined. 
This is an emerging market issue more than anything. And the developing -- excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven't seen substantive changes there relative to what we've seen historically. So I think what retailers and both manufacturers are looking for how do we continue to drive growth in the categories. Everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that. And obviously as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they're looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term. 
And that's where the innovation comes into play, and we'll continue to bring that to them. So we're being disciplined on it. The revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we're starting to pull away from promotions that don't deliver quality into the category, deliver quality into the P&L for us or our retailers. And you've seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we'll probably see things normalize in the back half of the year. We've planned for that. But again, our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and relaunching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category."

You mentioned a December retail load. You mentioned the comps so -- it was [ to the ] first quarter of pantry stock and expectation of a bit more back half-weighted EM growth story. Should we be braced for a more sluggish start to the year? That's the tactical question. And bigger picture, e-com growth, you talked about it a few times. Can you quantify what it is as a percentage of your sales today? How it compares to where you were before? And how, if at all, you're reimagining your marketing and media approach in the wake of the shift?"

I think the tactical question is where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021. And I think you're going to see -- obviously we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You've heard that from others who have announced. And that's, quite frankly, not unexpected. 
I mean I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus but more importantly, moving into the holiday season. And again, I'm talking U.S. here, moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. 
January, the categories have started to come back slightly. But so we're not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we've seen in the categories, whether it's liquid hand soap, or dish liquid cleaners, I think, are there to stay for a while, Jason. We'll see those at least -- from a liquid hand standpoint, stay there for the medium, long term. Obviously as people move back into offices and move away from home, you'll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs. But remember, those 3 categories aren't a significant percentage of our overall sales. So we'll see the categories, I think, sustain higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than '20 as we stated in the first half and then normalize in the back half. 
Coming to e-commerce. Again, a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from the outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in e-commerce. And it requires a lot more effort to do that. And the sophistication of dealing effectively in e-commerce is very different. And as if you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it's that same level of focus that we're bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an e-commerce standpoint. 
The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously as John mentioned, we exited the year with e-commerce at a double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company. And you've seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where e-commerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill's. You've seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that and building on that momentum. 
So we see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we're going to be where consumers are shopping. And we'll see those shifts as we go throughout the year. But the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in e-commerce where we get share, which is not very many places. So we'd know direction, and we still have more upside growth to be had there."

And so on a full year basis, the comps aren't really that different. Is that fair? And then on pet, I don't have a good idea just because vet centers were closed. So didn't know if you felt like the business ran at full capacity throughout the year at f5% capacity. Just trying to understand, as we're looking at the growth for 2021, what comps you really see?"

As I mentioned, broadly, the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year. And as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw, obviously, our shipments accelerate in the back half on Oral Care, particularly in Toothpaste -- and Toothpaste. So as we look to comp that next year, we'll see how the behavior come -- transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we've got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline that we think is good. So we'll see what happens. 
But again, the message here is that understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously, the U.S., being an important part of our toothpaste business, we've seen sluggishness there; strong pipeline, as you talked about, Pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out, and we're starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward. But our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we're bringing. 
Hill's, obviously the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year. So if I come back to the Hill's strategy, again, it's about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. And we're doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We're bringing great new products into the segment. We were pleased to see the Prescription Diet business start to come back, which I think is a representative of a couple of aspects on that business, which is one, we're seeing people return back to veterinarians and the Prescription Diet business benefiting from that. Our Hill's to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously the balanced growth we're seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S., which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again, both on the base business as well as Prescription Diet. So we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. 
The comps are difficult, to be sure. But again, remember, this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration and a great, great product offering. So as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending, focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we're bringing both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see, obviously, the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we've had this year. And the category continues to be strong at between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world. And obviously, the new channels that we're experiencing growth, specifically e-commerce, continued to deliver on that. 
So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you'll see in 2021 to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. So our comps are tough, and we realize that, but we think we've got good plans in place for 2021."

And obviously the importance of health and hygiene and trust played into that resurgence. And ultimately, as consumers move back in to stores and you get the benefit of displays, you will see perhaps some of the local brands reorient themselves and get some benefit of that. But if you look at the online world, obviously, the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that the local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking. And so over time, local brands will always be a threat. 
But I think as you've seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brands, trust and reputation and obviously, as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we'd never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategies and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they're orienting themselves locally based on the insights required to win. And we feel like the innovation structure that we put in place around the world, in terms of our focus on H1, H2 and H3 and being more local or required, will hopefully address those increasing challenges that we'll see as foot traffic increases in the back half."

And I guess, my real question underneath that is John had laid out a couple of caveats, raw materials inflation and others, as potentially pressuring gross profit progression as the year progresses. But it didn't sound like you were -- you expected those will be severe enough to actually turn gross margins negative year-over-year, but more simply just govern the expansion. I guess is that the right read? Or does the lower end of your EPS guidance range actually allow for a scenario where gross margins face some actual contraction if some of those uncertainties break the long line?"

So again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously we delivered -- coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin, funding the growth was 280 basis points. And you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately, we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter. And on the year, it was 130 with headwinds of around 230 on the year. So I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets. And that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we'll see in 2021. 
Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021. So we need to ensure obviously that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding the growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we're able to compensate that in the market. So the volatility we've seen on raw materials over the years, again, it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity in the revenue growth management initiative -- initiated. 
But I think the good story that we have, at least we're in a position where we took strong back half advertising -- excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that's based on the current rates that we're seeing. We'll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. So we're mindful of that. We feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input cost that we have and the current spot rates that we're seeing on foreign exchange."

Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health. So we like the dynamics of the category strategically. 
Obviously post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic stopping and derm offices. Foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas; foot traffic, obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020. So we started to see -- importantly, in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We spent the year, Lauren -- and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year. We spent the year investing behind those businesses. 
We weren't taking costs out. We were looking to optimize the cost. We were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses. So we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific. And we think we've set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term. 
And it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence, the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term. But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again, giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think long term, those categories will perform quite well."

As we alluded to, we expected performance in 2019 to improve in the back half based on those strategies, which it did. We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business. And we've seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year and in line with the expectations that we have. 
Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China. And pleasingly, we have seen shares grow nicely in online. Again, I think, a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation. And it's interesting index for you. Pre-COVID or pre -- the relaunch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category, so 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average. So again, clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business, delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair Line, like some of the focus that we've done in electric toothbrushes, have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. 
Now the brick-and-mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is again the significant changes we've made in some of our go-to-market that's taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID. 
So overall, pleased with the progress that we're making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in e-commerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way."

And that's been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you've heard me talk about quite a few of those today. 
Obviously the premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L; our revenue growth management efforts, which translate right through the P&L as well. You saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil, which is certainly bearing fruit; the Personal Care and Home Care leverage that we've seen, obviously, in those categories; and as we expect Oral Care to reaccelerate will drive more leverage through the P&L. Obviously funding the growth in productivity a real focus for us; great funding the growth in the back half of 2020; a real dialed up orientation behind some opportunities, particularly around our supply chain; and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage. 
The real cause of that of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and the increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage. And those logistics costs, we hope, will subside in the back half. We're looking at wage continue to optimize our warehousing and trade services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there. 
But the key driver of it is, again, investing for the long-term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we're seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned, particularly Hill's the U.S., China and as well as India. So overall, we'll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is dropping -- delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continue to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business. So overall, it's about growth, and we'll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that."

I will provide commentary on our Q1 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to discuss our 2021 priorities. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
We started 2021 in positive fashion, with strong organic sales growth despite a very difficult comparison, which included some consumer pantry loading in March of last year. Our net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 5% was driven by 0.5% organic volume growth and a 4.5% increase in pricing. Foreign exchange was a 1% tailwind in the quarter.
While the tough comparisons particularly impacted our trends in developed markets, which were flat on an organic sales basis in the quarter, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets with volume up 5.5% and pricing up 6%. We also delivered organic sales growth in 3 of our 4 categories: Oral Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition, while Personal Care organic sales declined due to difficult comparisons. We believe our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation, which Noel and Pat Verduin talked about at CAGNY, is bearing fruit, and we will continue to focus in this area to drive future growth.
Our efforts on premiumization and pricing, along with our focus on productivity, like our Funding the Growth initiative, drove improvement year-over-year in our gross margin, despite a worsening raw materials environment. This gross margin expansion was a key factor in allowing us to deliver base business earnings per share growth in line with our full year guidance despite higher logistics costs, incremental advertising spending and investment to build capabilities.
In the first quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.7% on both a GAAP basis, where we were up 50 basis points year-over-year and a base business basis, where we were up 40 basis points. For the first quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 310 basis point headwind. This is a large in for our first quarter, and it was driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like resins, fats and oils, agriculture-related costs and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 180 basis point benefit.
Our SG&A was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales for the first quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis. This was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind in innovation. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year.
For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 5% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 4% on a GAAP basis and up 7% on a base business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter against a very difficult comparison. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of accounts payable and other liabilities, which was mostly due to changes in the timing of payables and income tax payments.
A few comments on our divisional performance. North America net sales were down 0.5% in Q1, with organic sales down 1.5%, a 50 basis point benefit from the Hello acquisition and a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. Our volume declines in the quarter were primarily due to a combination of category deceleration in the face of difficult comparisons as we cycled last year's COVID pantry loading, logistics issues related to a warehouse transition on our U.S. business, that impacted our shelf availability and our market shares and the winter storms in February. The logistics issues lessened over the last month of the quarter as service levels improved, and we expect service levels to return to normal by the end of the second quarter.
Pricing grew mid-single digits in the quarter as our efforts in revenue growth management drove pricing growth across all our categories. The combination of higher raw materials costs, higher underlying logistics costs, and costs related to remediating the company's specific logistics issues, pressured margins in the North America division. Despite these headwinds, we continue to invest in advertising, particularly behind premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen and behind the continued strength of Colgate Optic White Renewal.
Latin America net sales were up 2%, as 9.5% organic sales growth was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. We continue to deliver broad-based organic sales growth in Latin America, with organic sales growth in all 3 categories and in every hub.
As we highlighted at CAGNY, our innovation in Latin America is driving growth in the premium segment of the toothpaste category. In Brazil, Colgate Total is gaining share behind Colgate Total Anti-Tartar and our natural extracts line is gaining share, particularly behind Charcoal. Our toothpaste value share is flat year-to-date in Brazil in measured channels. and is up year-over-year in e-coms.
Europe net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales were down 2%. Volume declined 3.5% in the quarter as we lapped strong shipments in the year ago period, which was driven by COVID-related demand in pantry loading. Pricing was plus 1.5% as we took pricing across all categories to help offset raw material inflation. We're launching equity campaigns across our core Oral Care equity, Colgate, Merida and Almex, and we're excited about the launch of Sanex microbiome, which Pat talked about at CAGNY.
We delivered 16.5% net sales and 11% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, led by volume growth across our biggest markets, Greater China, India and the Philippines. While China and India benefited from comparisons, that included COVID-related shutdowns in 2020, our innovation continues to drive improved underlying performance, particularly in e-commerce. Over the next several quarters, we will begin to roll out more premium innovation in brick-and-mortar in China, like our Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, leveraging the success we have had online in transforming our portfolio.
Africa/Euroasia net sales grew 8.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division. Volume grew 5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 8%. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% headwind. This growth was led by our toothpaste and manual toothbrush businesses, although we also delivered organic sales growth in Personal and Home Care. Our business in Turkey delivered strong sales and market share performance and launched significant premium innovation in naturals, charcoal and white.
Phil started the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth, despite lapping significant growth in the year ago period. Developed markets led the growth, particularly the U.S., Canada and Europe, led by e-commerce. Emerging markets grew organic sales greater than 20% in the quarter through a combination of volume and pricing growth. We're very excited about our Hill's equity campaign addressing pet obesity. This global campaign is leveraging digital, in-store, in-office and traditional media assets to drive growth in our weight control products across both our prescription and wellness businesses.
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As we think about our current organic growth assumptions, versus where we were 3 months ago, we're probably a little more cautious on developed markets. As you have seen from the scanner data, our categories moved negative more quickly than we had anticipated, and we expect that to continue in the short term. Hopefully, this allows for some of the volatility to play itself out sooner in the year, and we will see trends stabilize more quickly.
Coming into this year, in categories where consumption rose last year due to COVID, we expected 2021 consumption levels to be below 2020, but above the levels we saw in 2019. That is the case so far across our developed markets businesses, although year-to-date, these categories are slightly weaker than expected. Categories like toothpaste, where usage did not spike in relation to COVID, should normalize more quickly as we move past some of the aggressive pantry loading in March and April of last year, and we're beginning to see that happen and scale has returned to growth in the last several weeks.
We are encouraged by how we started the year in emerging markets. We saw broad-based organic sales growth in our emerging markets across all the divisions and with a good balance of volume and pricing. Comps will get more difficult as we go through the year, but we believe we have solid momentum.
Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in countries like Brazil, Mexico and India, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread at COVID and other disruptions related to COVID, and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in January. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
Our gross margin guidance remains unchanged as we expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, on both the GAAP and base business basis. As we mentioned on our 2020 year-end call, raw materials began the year moving higher and faster than we had expected. This trajectory has continued through the first quarter, as you all know. We are still laser-focused on driving our gross margin higher, but the significant increase in costs across our materials base obviously requires additional pricing and productivity. Advertising is still expected to be up on both a dollar and a percent of sales basis.
Logistics also continues to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S., where costs also have risen faster than anticipated. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term, but to moderate later in the year. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. We point out that our guidance does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. The adverse moves in foreign exchange and raw materials have moved us slightly lower in that range over the past few months, but it is still early in the year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

I think the results for the quarter really speak for themselves. Obviously, we're really pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite the significant volatility in headwinds, we delivered strong results around the world and up and down our P&L. While we've made progress in our strategic areas we've been discussing, we still have a lot to do in the balance of the year.
Here are our key priorities for the remainder of 2021: Continue to drive broad-based growth. Our priorities here are the same as we've discussed for the past several years. We need to grow volume and pricing. We need organic sales growth in every category and in every division in both emerging and developed markets.
In order to do this, we'll continue to ramp up our breakthrough and transformational premium innovation. We delivered high single-digit growth in toothpaste in the first quarter, despite lapping solid growth in the year-ago period, which helped us drive high single-digit growth in our Oral Care business. We're driving growth through innovation like Colgate Renewal in the U.S., Colgate Enzyme Whitening toothpaste in China, and our natural extracts line and Colgate Total Anti-Tartar line in Latin America.
As Pat and I discussed at CAGNY, this is a marathon, not a sprint, but we're making good progress, which will continue as we shift our resources, continue to build new skills and even adapt how we motivate our teams. Pricing is also an important element of growth. And behind our revenue growth management efforts, we continue to drive strong pricing as we look to increase our price index versus the market as well as offsetting rising costs.
You're hearing about rising costs from every company this quarter, and we're seeing inflation on pretty much every line of the P&L, but especially raw materials, warehousing and logistics. Naturally, our pricing plans are focused. We just discussed we're battling the cost inflation across the board. We are also driving savings through funding the growth and other efficiency initiatives, which helped to offset these headwinds, and effort Stan, our new CFO, is spearheading for us.
We do not expect these headwinds to abate anytime soon, so we have to continue to invest in marketing and building capabilities for future growth. While delivering on our earnings guidance, we know we need to be disciplined and efficient in this area.
The third is maintaining our focus on building out the key pillars of our long-term strategy, while simultaneously managing through all of the volatility. That includes building our capabilities on innovation, e-commerce, digital and data and analytics, progressing on ESG, including increasing our commitments on DE&I and advancing our 2025 sustainability targets. And then ultimately navigating to return to work for most of our office-based employees.
We are building a team and a culture at Colgate that is focused on adapting and changing to this volatile world. We're embracing new strategies and new ways of working, and it's paying off. We've had a good start to 2021 and we're looking to maintain our momentum through the rest of the year.
So with that, why don't we open it up to questions."

Thanks, Dara. If you go back, obviously, it depends on the geography. And what we've talked about consistently, I think, is the volatility that we're seeing all over the world and highly dependent on how countries have treated and dealt with COVID and the rate of incidents in those countries. 
Obviously, if you start with Asia, the categories are coming back, although still not back to where we were precoded due to some of the store closures that we continue to see across Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia coming back in terms of a category development standpoint. And that's based on the fact that, particularly in China, you see the COVID issues being put to rest and consumers returning to some level of normality.
Thailand continues to be a challenge. You've heard, I think, consistently from others that, that market highly dependent on tourism, so it's impacted that category. India, we won't talk a lot about India as we haven't announced yet, but suffice it to say that they had easy comps from last year, from a category standpoint, but you're starting to see those numbers come back quite nicely.
Moving on to Latin America. Again, surprisingly, we've seen a very resilient Latin America, particularly our business there. In terms of where we see the categories playing out, toothpaste is starting to come back, although it started off quite slowly, but we've seen, particularly in the recent readings, the category returning to growth, which is good.
Africa continues, I think, to perform okay. I think Africa is a real uncertain environment right now relative to the rate of vaccinations in that geography. So that will have an impact. But if you take that holistically across emerging markets, I think the important area here is that, obviously, those markets were from a GDP standpoint, severely impacted in 2020.
As you see oil prices come back to on the benefit of emerging markets, and that will play out in higher GDP, some inflation obviously allows us to continue to take pricing in those markets. And I think as you see the rate of vaccinations increase, those markets are likely to come back quite nicely, particularly in the back half of this year.
From a pricing standpoint, consistently across all emerging markets, we've been able to take strong pricing given the strength of our businesses, and that really started back in 2020. And you've seen a competitive environment is obviously having to offset a lot of the raw material inflation that we've seen taking pricing, which has allowed the emerging markets to take a little bit more value in their categories.
And clearly, there, from a per cap standpoint, we continue to be investing in our per capita programs, particularly across Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America, and that is consistent and I think that margin growth that we've had has allowed us to continue to invest in areas like per cap, which we think obviously bode well for the long term."

I think the pricing environment in Europe historically has been extremely difficult, as we all know. That being said, if you go back to a lot of the strategies that we've been putting in place around revenue of management, which is a discipline that we're really trying to embed across -- broadly across our commercial organizations, we're finding ways to get pricing into the P&L, particularly through how we manage gross to net.
Also in Europe is the strength of the elmex brand, obviously, meridol and elmex being strong premium brands with a strong brand loyalty, allow us to take more aggressive pricing in those markets. And we've been disciplined to do that on a pretty sequential basis across that continent. So that has obviously played nicely through the P&L.
So I'd say a combination of revenue growth management discipline really taking hold, more work to do to be sure. And some of the strength of our toothpaste equities in that region, which have allowed us to take more pricing. And to a certain extent, as we saw more lockdowns early on in the year, the promotional environment was probably a little bit more benign, but we've anticipated that will continue to accelerate as store traffic increases in the back half of the year."

And there's obviously then commodity inflation that we see locally in the markets, and we obviously look to gauge our price increases based on where the market is and what the consumer will bear.
But if you take a step back for a minute, it's the strength of our brands, I think, in emerging markets that have really allowed us to do more on the pricing line.
You talked about Latin America. If you go back last year in Latin America, we took 9.5% pricing in the third quarter, 9.5% pricing in the fourth quarter. And I think -- and even if you look at it across emerging markets, it was getting ahead of some of the pricing environment that we've incurred, the raw material pricing environment we've seen this year. So as you build that pricing into your P&L, that really set us up for strong growth on the pricing side in 2021. We've continued to take pricing as we've seen an elevated pricing inflation environment around raw and pack, and that's allowed us, obviously, to deliver the gross margins in the quarter.
So again, we continue to look at the marketplace. So as I mentioned earlier, our competitors are facing the same level of inflation that we are. And as a result, that environment, versus just foreign exchange, creates a healthier environment to take pricing, particularly in emerging markets."

And assuming that's the case, which I think seems to be a reasonable assumption, what are the offsets that will escalate in kind to try to help you still get gross margin expansion in this environment, which would truly be phenomenal? Are we looking for more productivity than it's typical in the year? price continuing to climb? Or are there other offsets we should consider?"

I think we would anticipate, as we have built into our guidance, that costs will continue to remain inflated as we move through the year. And as we start to lap some of the increases that we saw later in the back half of last year, it will become a little bit more benign in that regard. 
A couple of things. Obviously, continue to be highly disciplined about taking pricing and taking it quickly, and that will continue to be the case. We've got to be courageous in holds in that regard. Obviously, we watch that carefully based on what's happening in the local marketplace, but straight price increases will continue to be an important element as we look at the back half of the year.
The revenue growth management aspect, I've referred to a couple of times, that is an important discipline that we really need to embed across our organizations. And I think we've seen some fruits of that, at least last year and coming into the first quarter this year. So that will continue to happen.
The other important aspect to look at is if you look at the mix of our business, last year, we saw significant lifts from some of the lower-margin categories that were driven by COVID, so things like bar soap and liquid hand soap.
As Oral Care begins to normalize and the category returns to historical trends, that will certainly help from a mix standpoint. Likewise, our professional health business, which obviously was significantly impacted by closures, although that business is starting to come back quite nicely, still not back to where it was from a store opening standpoint as well as travel retail. And as that continues to unfold through the balance of the year, that will likewise help a bit.
And obviously, as foreign exchange, we talked a little bit, not seeing the benefit we initially anticipated, but still somewhat of a benefit, that will ultimately help through the P&L.
The other aspect I'd say, Jason, is moving -- getting volume moving through the P&L in the back half. Obviously, taking pricing allows us to support the advertising and innovation, which is critically important. And we've always said that's part of our strategy, make sure we get the margin to support the advertising and the investment, and that will obviously bode well for the pricing that we see in the back half of -- excuse me, in the volume that we anticipate to improve in the back half of the year."

Thanks, Chris. And clearly, really, really happy with the progress because it really underscores and gives us confidence in our strategy, 7% organic on 20 -- comping 20 last year is terrific.
So a couple of aspects that excite us relative to the category. One, you mentioned that the pet ownership is up. That's an annuity, quite frankly, for the category. As you see pet ownership increase, obviously, those pets need to be fed, and that will ultimately play back in the dynamics of the category moving forward.
Second is the aspects associated with our business, low penetrated business for Hill's, low brand awareness business for Hill's. So that, again, underscores and underpins the strategy that we have, continue to increase investment, continue to drive core innovation and continue to drive premium innovation on the prescription diet, particularly as we see consumers returning into the vet space or returning to visit their vets. That will obviously bode well for the Prescription Diet business. But again, tough comps moving forward to be sure. But the business has real momentum, not only in the U.S., which continues to perform exceptionally well, but emerging markets likewise had a terrific quarter and a lot of head space there for us. But we're being very methodical and thoughtful on how we generate this growth. We're looking for long-term sustainable profitable growth, building the brands and markets and doing that the right way.
And we have the momentum to do that and the flexibility in the P&L. Obviously, we've seen some rising prices on agricultural commodities, and we need to take some pricing as we did. But overall, the health of the business, underscored by pet ownership, the low brand awareness and penetration that we have, gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this business forward."

So obviously, we're concerned about India, obviously, given what's going on with the case counts in the country. That being said, you've heard us talk time and time again for the last 15 months that the health and safety of our employees remains #1. We have taken significant precautions across India to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is there. And with those efforts, we're pleased to say that we continue to operate all of our plants in India with no disruption.
Our most significant plant there, a good percentage of the employees have been vaccinated, which is terrific. And we're seeing, obviously, the performance of that plant, relative to not only India for the region, continue to deliver against expectations. That being said, we can't control whatever the government decides to do in terms of further lockdowns. But at this stage, the plant is being run extremely well, and the business across the region is benefiting from that capacity.
Relative to professional skin, obviously, a tough, tough year for professional skin, particularly given the channels that we're focused on, whether it be spas, dermatologists or travel retail. But all those businesses are slowly coming back. And we saw good performance of the skin health business in the first quarter. In fact, that business was up double digit. We're seeing a return to offices, and the foot traffic going back into the professional space increasing month in and month out, obviously not back to where we were pre-COVID, but the trends are positive, particularly across North America.
The one outlier is obviously still the travel retail business in China. While travel retail has moved internal to China, the real travel retail historically, which was a good part of the business, has not returned. And we expect to start to see that loosen up a bit in the back half. But again, we spent a lot of time in 2020 building capabilities and really learning the business, getting the innovation profile right to set us up for good growth in 2021."

But nevertheless, it was a low watermark for segment margins in a very long time. So they've been a lot of discussion on pricing, but I wanted to, at a more granular level, talk about what percentage of your portfolio in North America, specifically in the U.S., really, do you think that you can cover through pricing? What has already been announced to retailers? 
The environment here certainly seems a lot more amenable currently than it had been even just a few months ago for obvious reasons here in terms of retailer receptivity. And then just sort of rounding it out, what should the market expect in terms of margin recovery here in the segment for the balance of the year? So thanks for that."

Obviously, the category expectations that we had declined more than we anticipated faster and deeper, quite frankly. On top of that, we obviously saw a significant increase in raw materials more than expected.
Third, and this was the biggest piece versus our expectations, was logistics. Two issues there. Obviously, the capacity and cost of logistics broadly across the U.S. have gone up quite significantly, and that was exacerbated by a specific event that we had in a warehouse that we were opening up and had some transition issues associated with that compounded our problems.
So with that, those -- the warehouse issues are quickly moving behind us. Our service levels are quickly returning to where they were, but it certainly had a short-term impact, both from a sales standpoint, a market share standpoint and importantly, from an operating margin standpoint. 
That being said, if I characterize a little bit about what's going on in the U.S., I mean, the categories were quite concerning, obviously, moving through the March period, where we saw significant declines more than we anticipated. But the silver lining here, I think, on North America is we've seen categories in the last 2 weeks come back nicely. In fact, particularly around the toothpaste category, which is rebounding up double digits in the last 2 weeks, particularly as we see store traffic and foot traffic return to stores.
We've got a good innovation pipeline planned. And as you saw, we've maintained our support, which we think is extremely important to continue to obviously drive volume and share in the back half, and we're laser-focused on logistics and raw material costs.
Relative to pricing, again, revenue growth management, we're not going to talk to our plans on price increases at this time, but it's a market where everyone is certainly looking at that aspect very, very closely. And I anticipate that you'll see more price increases across the sector, given the headwinds that everyone has faced in this space.
But again, we're focused on this. I think the team's got a good handle of what's going on, get the service issue behind us, which it is, and we'll move forward. Q2 will continue to be a very difficult comp for the U.S. As you saw last year, we had significant growth in Q2 as well. And so that will be a difficult comp, but it will be dependent highly on where the categories end up as we move forward."

No, it has not distracted us from our strategy. Premiumization continues to be a very important element. We've talked a lot with you regarding our refocused orientation on innovation between H1, H2 and H3, very much focused on the aspects of H1 and H2, which are premium brands.
And if you look at the growth of Oral Care in the first quarter, particularly toothpaste, a good percentage of that came from our premiumization strategy. I'll give you a good example. Good shares in Brazil holding shares despite a pretty competitive environment. Our premium business in Brazil alone was 27% of our business, roughly, I think, in 2018. It's up to 30% of our business year-to-date, and it's up 120 basis points versus last year. So a good indication that the launch of the Colgate Tartar Control, some of the natural extracts bundles, the launch of elmex in the market there, those are important initiatives to continue to close our index, and we still have a ways to go to close the index that we've talked about. So premiumization will continue to play.
And I don't think, quite frankly, even though some of these markets will be under pressure, economically, the fact that we have innovation across all of our price points and historically, we play very aggressively both in the opening as well as the mid-price, we think we have the ability to leverage our portfolio effectively as we see the economic circumstances change. But again, premiumization will continue to be a focus.
You saw it in Asia, particularly where we're launching and leading with premium innovation in our online business in Asia. Our online business continues to grow. I think it was up over 200 basis points year-to-date. So again, supporting the fact that the premiumization strategy is working and will be agile relative to how we see the market evolve and need be we will play more in the mid and opening, should that be necessary.
I think what's importantly is we get more and more consumers back into stores historically, that is where we have performed so well. and our ability to generate more volume and pricing opportunities as consumers track back into the shopping environment bodes well.
But that being said, I'll also say our e-commerce business continues to perform exceptionally well. That was a big growth driver for us and it's comping a difficult number last year. We continue to show strong growth and our shares are pretty consistently up across the board in the online environment."

There's so many inputs that go into thinking about how and where we spend money. We're being more strategic on where we spend our money. That is underscored by the innovation strategy that we've outlined relative -- particularly premiumization, which, in our view, requires the right level of advertising to seed it. 
And so as a result of that, there's not a specific number that we're looking at. I think the most important aspect for us is continued sustainable profitable growth. And you've seen that now quite consistently over the previous couple of years. And that's the barometer we're holding ourselves to, is to continue to drive that top line.
We obviously now have the ability as we shift more and more money into digital to really assess the performance of that spend, and that makes the economics and efficiency of our advertising that much better as we think about how we want to spend and where we want to spend.
And so we -- as we see the opportunities unfold, as we see the plethora of brands and innovation that we have to support, we'll continue to put money in advertising as we're seeing a return on that investment. And I think you've seen that.
It's all kind of obviously linked. We've got premium innovation driving gross margin That puts more dollar margin into the P&L and ultimately transfers into better advertising, more advertising support, more capabilities and more EPS. And so it's a balance across all of it. There's not one specific goal we're looking to achieve.

And that involves us taking money and putting it where we think we're going to get the best return through the P&L on that.
And it's building businesses and geographies that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. It's building businesses that have the right demographics and category opportunity in terms of growth potential for them. And obviously, making sure that the mix of our spending and the mix of our innovation continues to be premiumized, which requires investment. And you couple that with, obviously, the need to continue to support a lot of that organic stuff that we do on the market.

And certainly, as we see the categories unfold in the back half of the year, we'll continue to allocate accordingly based on where we see the best growth opportunity."

On the corporate side, actually, when you look at the SG&A line, that was driven by logistics and advertising. So if you strip out just our corporate fixed costs, our corporate fixed cost, pleasingly, were actually down in that equation.
So I think a lot of the productivity initiatives that we're focused on across the P&L and managing cost actually delivered a fixed cost reduction in the quarter, which was terrific to see.
Moving on to specifically e-commerce. I mean obviously, the growth numbers are terrific across the board relative to our focus there. And as you look at market share increases, we've seen those in North America. We've seen those in Hill's. We're seeing those in Asia quite nicely. We're seeing those in Latin America. In fact, I got some India numbers that look outstanding.
So again, where we're focusing time and effort and certainly putting the investment there, we're seeing a good return on that. I think that bodes well as we continue to see the growth of e-commerce. We exited the year at double digit on e-commerce, and that number has accelerated in the first quarter. So I think the focus and strategies we have in place continue to be well received in the marketplace.
I'll give you 1 data point. We're up 260 basis points versus the first quarter last year on a percent of sales on our e-commerce business. So again, I think it's growing quite nicely and importantly, driving market share of new users into the franchise."

[Operator Instructions]
We started 2021 in positive fashion, with strong organic sales growth despite a very difficult comparison, which included some consumer pantry loading in March of last year. Our net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 5% was driven by 0.5% organic volume growth and a 4.5% increase in pricing. Foreign exchange was a 1% tailwind in the quarter.
While the tough comparisons particularly impacted our trends in developed markets, which were flat on an organic sales basis in the quarter, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets with volume up 5.5% and pricing up 6%. We also delivered organic sales growth in 3 of our 4 categories: Oral Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition, while Personal Care organic sales declined due to difficult comparisons. We believe our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation, which Noel and Pat Verduin talked about at CAGNY, is bearing fruit, and we will continue to focus in this area to drive future growth.
Our efforts on premiumization and pricing, along with our focus on productivity, like our Funding the Growth initiatives, drove improvement year-over-year in our gross margin, despite a worsening raw materials environment. This gross margin expansion was a key factor in allowing us to deliver base business earnings per share growth in line with our full year guidance despite higher logistics costs, incremental advertising spending and investment to build capabilities.
In the first quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.7% on both a GAAP basis, where we were up 50 basis points year-over-year and a base business basis, where we were up 40 basis points. For the first quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 310 basis point headwind. This is a large in for our first quarter, and it was driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like resins, fats and oils, agriculture-related costs and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 180 basis point benefit.
Our SG&A was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales for the first quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis. This was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S. and investments behind innovation. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year.
For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 5% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 4% on a GAAP basis and up 7% on a base business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter against a very difficult comparison. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of accounts payable and other liabilities, which was mostly due to changes in the timing of payables and income tax payments.
A few comments on our divisional performance. North America net sales were down 0.5% in Q1, with organic sales down 1.5%, a 50 basis point benefit from the Hello acquisition and a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. Our volume declines in the quarter were primarily due to a combination of category deceleration in the face of difficult comparisons as we cycled last year's COVID pantry loading, logistics issues related to a warehouse transition on our U.S. business, that impacted our shelf availability and our market shares and the winter storms in February. The logistics issues lessened over the last month of the quarter as service levels improved, and we expect service levels to return to normal by the end of the second quarter.
Pricing grew mid-single digits in the quarter as our efforts in revenue growth management drove pricing growth across all our categories. The combination of higher raw materials costs, higher underlying logistics costs, and costs related to remediating the company's specific logistics issues, pressured margins in the North America division. Despite these headwinds, we continue to invest in advertising, particularly behind premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen and behind the continued strength of Colgate Optic White Renewal.
Latin America net sales were up 2%, as 9.5% organic sales growth was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. We continue to deliver broad-based organic sales growth in Latin America, with organic sales growth in all 3 categories and in every hub.
As we highlighted at CAGNY, our innovation in Latin America is driving growth in the premium segment of the toothpaste category. In Brazil, Colgate Total is gaining share behind Colgate Total anti-tartar and our natural extracts line is gaining share, particularly behind Charcoal. Our toothpaste value share is flat year-to-date in Brazil in measured channels. and is up year-over-year in e-coms.
Europe net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales were down 2%. Volume declined 3.5% in the quarter as we lapped strong shipments in the year ago period, which was driven by COVID-related demand in pantry loading. Pricing was plus 1.5% as we took pricing across all categories to help offset raw material inflation. We're launching equity campaigns across our core Oral Care equity, Colgate, meridol and elmex, and we're excited about the launch of Sanex microbiome, which Pat talked about at CAGNY.
We delivered 16.5% net sales and 11% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, led by volume growth across our biggest markets, Greater China, India and the Philippines. While China and India benefited from comparisons, that included COVID-related shutdowns in 2020, our innovation continues to drive improved underlying performance, particularly in e-commerce. Over the next several quarters, we will begin to roll out more premium innovation in brick-and-mortar in China, like our Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, leveraging the success we have had online in transforming our portfolio.
Africa/Euroasia net sales grew 8.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division. Volume grew 5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 8%. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% headwind. This growth was led by our toothpaste and manual toothbrush businesses, although we also delivered organic sales growth in Personal and Home Care. Our business in Turkey delivered strong sales and market share performance and launched significant premium innovation in naturals, charcoal and white.
Phil started the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth, despite lapping significant growth in the year ago period. Developed markets led the growth, particularly the U.S., Canada and Europe, led by e-commerce. Emerging markets grew organic sales greater than 20% in the quarter through a combination of volume and pricing growth. We're very excited about our Hill's equity campaign addressing pet obesity. This global campaign is leveraging digital, in-store, in-office and traditional media assets to drive growth in our weight control products across both our prescription and wellness businesses.
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As we think about our current organic growth assumptions, versus where we were 3 months ago, we're probably a little more cautious on developed markets. As you have seen from the scanner data, our categories moved negative more quickly than we had anticipated, and we expect that to continue in the short term. Hopefully, this allows for some of the volatility to play itself out sooner in the year, and we will see trends stabilize more quickly.
Coming into this year, in categories where consumption rose last year due to COVID, we expected 2021 consumption levels to be below 2020, but above the levels we saw in 2019. That is the case so far across our developed markets businesses, although year-to-date, these categories are slightly weaker than expected. Categories like toothpaste, where usage did not spike in relation to COVID, should normalize more quickly as we move past some of the aggressive pantry loading in March and April of last year, and we're beginning to see that happen and scale has returned to growth in the last several weeks.
We are encouraged by how we started the year in emerging markets. We saw broad-based organic sales growth in our emerging markets across all the divisions and with a good balance of volume and pricing. Comps will get more difficult as we go through the year, but we believe we have solid momentum.
Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in countries like Brazil, Mexico and India, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread at COVID and other disruptions related to COVID, and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in January. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
Our gross margin guidance remains unchanged as we expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, on both the GAAP and base business basis. As we mentioned on our 2020 year-end call, raw materials began the year moving higher and faster than we had expected. This trajectory has continued through the first quarter, as you all know. We are still laser-focused on driving our gross margin higher, but the significant increase in costs across our materials base obviously requires additional pricing and productivity. Advertising is still expected to be up on both a dollar and a percent of sales basis.
Logistics also continues to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S., where costs also have risen faster than anticipated. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term, but to moderate later in the year. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. We point out that our guidance does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. The adverse moves in foreign exchange and raw materials have moved us slightly lower in that range over the past few months, but it is still early in the year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

I think the results for the quarter really speak for themselves. Obviously, we're really pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite the significant volatility in headwinds, we delivered strong results around the world and up and down our P&L. While we've made progress in our strategic areas we've been discussing, we still have a lot to do in the balance of the year.
Here are our key priorities for the remainder of 2021: Continue to drive broad-based growth. Our priorities here are the same as we've discussed for the past several years. We need to grow volume and pricing. We need organic sales growth in every category and in every division in both emerging and developed markets.
In order to do this, we'll continue to ramp up our breakthrough and transformational premium innovation. We delivered high single-digit growth in toothpaste in the first quarter, despite lapping solid growth in the year-ago period, which helped us drive high single-digit growth in our Oral Care business. We're driving growth through innovation like Colgate Renewal in the U.S., Colgate Enzyme Whitening toothpaste in China, and our natural extracts line and Colgate Total anti-tartar line in Latin America.
As Pat and I discussed at CAGNY, this is a marathon, not a sprint, but we're making good progress, which will continue as we shift our resources, continue to build new skills and even adapt how we motivate our teams. Pricing is also an important element of growth. And behind our revenue growth management efforts, we continue to drive strong pricing as we look to increase our price index versus the market as well as offsetting rising costs.
You're hearing about rising costs from every company this quarter, and we're seeing inflation on pretty much every line of the P&L, but especially raw materials, warehousing and logistics. Naturally, our pricing plans are focused. We just discussed we're battling the cost inflation across the board. We are also driving savings through funding the growth and other efficiency initiatives, which helped to offset these headwinds, an effort Stan, our new CFO, is spearheading for us. We do not expect these headwinds to abate anytime soon, so we have to continue to invest in marketing and building capabilities for future growth while delivering on our earnings guidance. We know we need to be disciplined and efficient in this area.
The third is maintaining our focus on building out the key pillars of our long-term strategy, while simultaneously managing through all of the volatility. That includes building our capabilities on innovation, e-commerce, digital and data and analytics, progressing on ESG, including increasing our commitments on DE&I and advancing our 2025 sustainability targets. And then ultimately navigating to return to work for most of our office-based employees.
We are building a team and a culture at Colgate that is focused on adapting and changing to this volatile world. We're embracing new strategies and new ways of working, and it's paying off. We've had a good start to 2021 and we're looking to maintain our momentum through the rest of the year.
So with that, why don't we open it up to questions."

Thanks, Dara. If you go back, obviously, it depends on the geography. And what we've talked about consistently, I think, is the volatility that we're seeing all over the world and highly dependent on how countries have treated and dealt with COVID and the rate of incidents in those countries. 
Obviously, if you start with Asia, the categories are coming back, although still not back to where we were pre-COVID due to some of the store closures that we continue to see across Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia coming back in terms of a category development standpoint. And that's based on the fact that, particularly in China, you see the COVID issues being put to rest and consumers returning to some level of normality.
Thailand continues to be a challenge. You've heard, I think, consistently from others that, that market highly dependent on tourism, so it's impacted that category. India, we won't talk a lot about India as we haven't announced yet, but suffice it to say that they had easy comps from last year, from a category standpoint, but you're starting to see those numbers come back quite nicely.
Moving on to Latin America. Again, surprisingly, we've seen a very resilient Latin America, particularly our business there. In terms of where we see the categories playing out, toothpaste is starting to come back, although it started off quite slowly, but we've seen, particularly in the recent readings, the category returning to growth, which is good.
Africa continues, I think, to perform okay. I think Africa is a real uncertain environment right now relative to the rate of vaccinations in that geography. So that will have an impact. But if you take that holistically across emerging markets, I think the important area here is that, obviously, those markets were, from a GDP standpoint, severely impacted in 2020.
As you see oil prices come back and to benefit emerging markets, and that will play out in higher GDP, some inflation obviously allows us to continue to take pricing in those markets. And I think as you see the rate of vaccinations increase, those markets are likely to come back quite nicely, particularly in the back half of this year.
From a pricing standpoint, consistently across all emerging markets, we've been able to take strong pricing given the strength of our businesses, and that really started back in 2020. And you've seen a competitive environment is obviously having to offset a lot of the raw material inflation that we've seen taking pricing, which has allowed the emerging markets to take a little bit more value in their categories.
And clearly, there, from a per cap standpoint, we continue to be investing in our per capita programs, particularly across Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America, and that is consistent and I think that margin growth that we've had has allowed us to continue to invest in areas like per cap, which we think obviously bode well for the long term."

I think the pricing environment in Europe historically has been extremely difficult, as we all know. That being said, if you go back to a lot of the strategies that we've been putting in place around revenue of management, which is a discipline that we're really trying to embed across -- broadly across our commercial organizations, we're finding ways to get pricing into the P&L, particularly through how we manage gross to net.
Also in Europe is the strength of the elmex brand, obviously, meridol and elmex being strong premium brands with a strong brand loyalty, allow us to take more aggressive pricing in those markets. And we've been disciplined to do that on a pretty sequential basis across that continent. So that has obviously played nicely through the P&L.
So I'd say a combination of revenue growth management discipline really taking hold, more work to do to be sure. And some of the strength of our toothpaste equities in that region, which have allowed us to take more pricing. And to a certain extent, as we saw more lockdowns early on in the year, the promotional environment was probably a little bit more benign, but we've anticipated that will continue to accelerate as store traffic increases in the back half of the year."

You talked about Latin America. If you go back last year in Latin America, we took 9.5% pricing in the third quarter, 9.5% pricing in the fourth quarter. And I think -- and even if you look at it across emerging markets, it was getting ahead of some of the pricing environment that we've incurred, the raw material pricing environment we've seen this year. So as you build that pricing into your P&L, that really sets us up for strong growth on the pricing side in 2021. We've continued to take pricing as we've seen an elevated pricing -- inflation environment around raw and packed, and that's allowed us, obviously, to deliver the gross margins in the quarter.
So again, we continue to look at the marketplace. So as I mentioned earlier, our competitors are facing the same level of inflation that we are. And as a result, that environment, versus just foreign exchange, creates a healthier environment to take pricing, particularly in emerging markets."

The inflation rate this quarter, 310 bips drag, it's almost 8% year-on-year COGS inflation. Is it safe to assume that, that number should escalate as we progress through the year? And assuming that's the case, which I think seems to be a reasonable assumption, what are the offsets that will escalate in kind to try to help you still get gross margin expansion in this environment, which would truly be phenomenal? Are we looking for more productivity than is typical in the year? Price continuing to climb? Or are there other offsets we should consider?"

I think we would anticipate, as we have built into our guidance, that costs will continue to remain inflated as we move through the year. And as we start to lap some of the increases that we saw later in the back half of last year, it will become a little bit more benign in that regard. 
A couple of things. Obviously, continuing to be highly disciplined about taking pricing and taking it quickly, and that will continue to be the case. We've got to be courageous and bold in that regard. Obviously, we watch that carefully based on what's happening in the local marketplace, but straight price increases will continue to be an important element as we look at the back half of the year.
The revenue growth management aspect, we've referred to a couple of times, that is an important discipline that we really need to embed across our organizations. And I think we've seen some fruits of that, at least last year and coming into the first quarter this year. So that will continue to happen.
The other important aspect to look at is if you look at the mix of our business, last year, we saw significant lifts from some of the lower-margin categories that were driven by COVID, so things like bar soap and liquid hand soap.
As Oral Care begins to normalize and the category returns to historical trends, that will certainly help from a mix standpoint. Likewise, our professional health business, which obviously was significantly impacted by closures, although that business is starting to come back quite nicely, still not back to where it was from a store opening standpoint as well as travel retail. And as that continues to unfold through the balance of the year, that will likewise help a bit.
And obviously, as foreign exchange, we talked a little bit, not seeing the benefit we initially anticipated, but still somewhat of a benefit, that will ultimately help through to the P&L.
The other aspect I'd say, Jason, is moving -- getting volume moving through the P&L in the back half. Obviously, taking pricing allows us to support the advertising and innovation, which is critically important. And we've always said that's part of our strategy, make sure we get the margin to support the advertising and the investment, and that will obviously bode well for the pricing that we see in the back half of -- excuse me, in the volume that we anticipate to improve in the back half of the year."

Thanks, Chris. And clearly, really, really happy with the progress because it really underscores and gives us confidence in our strategy, 7% organic on '20 -- comping '20 last year is terrific.
So a couple of aspects that excite us relative to the category. One, you mentioned that the pet ownership is up. That's an annuity, quite frankly, for the category. As you see pet ownership increase, obviously, those pets need to be fed, and that will ultimately play back in the dynamics of the category moving forward.
Second is the aspects associated with our business, low penetrated business for Hill's, low brand awareness business for Hill's. So that, again, underscores and underpins the strategy that we have, continue to increase investment, continue to drive core innovation and continue to drive premium innovation on the prescription diet, particularly as we see consumers returning into the vet space or returning to visit their vets. That will obviously bode well for the Prescription Diet business. But again, tough comps moving forward to be sure. But the business has real momentum, not only in the U.S., which continues to perform exceptionally well, but emerging markets likewise had a terrific quarter and a lot of head space there for us. But we're being very methodical and thoughtful on how we generate this growth. We're looking for long-term sustainable profitable growth, building the brands and markets and doing that the right way.
And we have the momentum to do that and the flexibility in the P&L. Obviously, we've seen some rising prices on agricultural commodities, and we need to take some pricing as we did. But overall, the health of the business, underscored by pet ownership, the low brand awareness and penetration that we have, gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this business forward."

So obviously, we're concerned about India, obviously, given what's going on with the case counts in the country. That being said, you've heard us talk time and time again for the last 15 months that the health and safety of our employees remains #1. We have taken significant precautions across India to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is there. And with those efforts, we're pleased to say that we continue to operate all of our plants in India with no disruption.
Our most significant plant there, a good percentage of the employees have been vaccinated, which is terrific. And we're seeing, obviously, the performance of that plant, relative to not only India for the region, continue to deliver against expectations. That being said, we can't control whatever the government decides to do in terms of further lockdowns. But at this stage, the plant is being run extremely well, and the business across the region is benefiting from that capacity.
Relative to professional skin, obviously, a tough, tough year for professional skin, particularly given the channels that we're focused on, whether it be spas, dermatologists or travel retail. But all those businesses are slowly coming back. And we saw good performance of the skin health business in the first quarter. In fact, that business was up double digit. We're seeing a return to offices, and the foot traffic going back into the professional space increasing month in and month out, obviously not back to where we were pre-COVID, but the trends are positive, particularly across North America.
The one outlier is obviously still the travel retail business in China. While travel retail has moved internal to China, the real travel retail historically, which was a good part of the business, has not returned. And we expect to start to see that loosen up a bit in the back half. But again, we spent a lot of time in 2020 building capabilities and really learning the business, getting the innovation profile right to set us up for good growth in 2021."

But nevertheless, it was a low watermark for segment margins in a very long time. So [ there have ] been a lot of discussion on pricing, but I wanted to, at a more granular level, talk about what percentage of your portfolio in North America, specifically in the U.S., really, do you think that you can cover through pricing? What has already been announced to retailers? 
The environment here certainly seems a lot more amenable currently than it had been even just a few months ago for obvious reasons here in terms of retailer receptivity. And then just sort of rounding it out, what should the market expect in terms of margin recovery here in the segment for the balance of the year? So thanks for that."

Obviously, the category expectations that we had declined more than we anticipated, faster and deeper, quite frankly. On top of that, we obviously saw a significant increase in raw materials more than expected.
Third, and this was the biggest piece versus our expectations, was logistics. Two issues there. Obviously, the capacity and cost of logistics broadly across the U.S. have gone up quite significantly, and that was exacerbated by a specific event that we had in a warehouse that we were opening up and had some transition issues associated with that, that compounded our problems.
So with that, those -- the warehouse issues are quickly moving behind us. Our service levels are quickly returning to where they were, but it certainly had a short-term impact, both from a sales standpoint, a market share standpoint and importantly, from an operating margin standpoint. 
That being said, if I characterize a little bit about what's going on in the U.S., I mean, the categories were quite concerning, obviously, moving through the March period, where we saw significant declines more than we anticipated. But the silver lining here, I think, on North America is we've seen categories in the last 2 weeks come back nicely. In fact, particularly around the toothpaste category, which is rebounding up double digits in the last 2 weeks, particularly as we see store traffic and foot traffic return to stores.
We've got a good innovation pipeline planned. And as you saw, we've maintained our support, which we think is extremely important to continue to obviously drive volume and share in the back half, and we're laser-focused on logistics and raw material costs.
Relative to pricing, again, revenue growth management, we're not going to talk to our plans on price increases at this time, but it's a market where everyone is certainly looking at that aspect very, very closely. And I anticipate that you'll see more price increases across the sector, given the headwinds that everyone has faced in this space.
But again, we're focused on this. I think the team's got a good handle of what's going on, get the service issue behind us, which it is, and we'll move forward. Q2 will continue to be a very difficult comp for the U.S. As you saw last year, we had significant growth in Q2 as well. And so that will be a difficult comp, but it'll be dependent highly on where the categories end up as we move forward."

So in light of the uncertainties that you called out on emerging markets and some of the volatility we've seen in developed market category trends and just the notion that there's inflationary pressure building on the consumer shopping basket, not only in your categories, but more broadly, does that impact at all what you anticipate in terms of consumer appetite for that premium innovation that you're bringing to market, especially if the prices associated with it are going higher?

No, it has not distracted us from our strategy. Premiumization continues to be a very important element. We've talked a lot with you regarding our refocused orientation on innovation between H1, H2 and H3, very much focused on the aspects of H1 and H2, which are premium brands.
And if you look at the growth of Oral Care in the first quarter, particularly toothpaste, a good percentage of that came from our premiumization strategy. I'll give you a good example. Good shares in Brazil, holding shares despite a pretty competitive environment. Our premium business in Brazil alone was 27% of our business, roughly, I think, in 2018. It's up to 30% of our business year-to-date, and it's up 120 basis points versus last year. So a good indication that the launch of the Colgate Tartar Control, some of the natural extracts bundles, the launch of elmex in the market there, those are important initiatives to continue to close our index, and we still have a ways to go to close the index that we've talked about. So premiumization will continue to play.
And I don't think, quite frankly, even though some of these markets will be under pressure, economically, the fact that we have innovation across all of our price points and historically, we play very aggressively both in the opening as well as the mid-price, we think we have the ability to leverage our portfolio effectively as we see the economic circumstances change. But again, premiumization will continue to be a focus.
You saw it in Asia, particularly where we're launching and leading with premium innovation in our online business in Asia. Our online business continues to grow. I think it was up over 200 basis points year-to-date. So again, supporting the fact that the premiumization strategy is working and will be agile relative to how we see the market evolve; and need be, we will play more in the mid and opening, should that be necessary.
I think what's importantly is we get more and more consumers back into stores historically, that is where we have performed so well, and our ability to generate more volume and pricing opportunities as consumers track back into the shopping environment bodes well.
But that being said, I'll also say our e-commerce business continues to perform exceptionally well. That was a big growth driver for us and it's comping a difficult number last year. We continue to show strong growth and our shares are pretty consistently up across the board in the online environment."

That is underscored by the innovation strategy that we've outlined relative -- particularly premiumization, which, in our view, requires the right level of advertising to seed it. 
And so as a result of that, there's not a specific number that we're looking at. I think the most important aspect for us is continued sustainable profitable growth. And you've seen that now quite consistently over the previous couple of years. And that's the barometer we're holding ourselves to, is to continue to drive that top line.
We obviously now have the ability, as we shift more and more money into digital, to really assess the performance of that spend, and that makes the economics and efficiency of our advertising that much better as we think about how we want to spend and where we want to spend.
And so we -- as we see the opportunities unfold, as we see the plethora of brands and innovation that we have to support, we'll continue to put money in advertising as we're seeing a return on that investment. And I think you've seen that.
It's all kind of obviously linked. We've got premium innovation driving gross margin That puts more dollar margin into the P&L and ultimately transfers into better advertising, more advertising support, more capabilities and more EPS. And so it's a balance across all of it. There's not one specific goal we're looking to achieve.

And rather than being somewhat democratic in that process, and as a result of that coming out of COVID, we're going to continue to be laser-focused on executing against our strategy. And that involves us taking money and putting it where we think we're going to get the best return through the P&L on that.
And it's building businesses and geographies that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. It's building businesses that have the right demographics and category opportunity in terms of growth potential for them. And obviously, making sure that the mix of our spending and the mix of our innovation continues to be premiumized, which requires investment. And you couple that with, obviously, the need to continue to support a lot of that organic stuff that we do on the market. We talked about per capita consumption programs as a result of our focus on education and doing things of that nature. So all these aspects are critically important to driving the investment strategy, so to speak.
So again, it's just built on, I think, a well thought through strategic plan. It's anchored against making good choices of where we want to spend. And certainly, as we see the categories unfold in the back half of the year, we'll continue to allocate accordingly based on where we see the best growth opportunity."

On the corporate side, actually, when you look at the SG&A line, that was driven by logistics and advertising. So if you strip out just our corporate fixed costs, our corporate fixed costs, pleasingly, were actually down in that equation. So I think a lot of the productivity initiatives that we're focused on across the P&L and managing cost actually delivered a fixed cost reduction in the quarter, which was terrific to see.
Moving on to specifically e-commerce. I mean obviously, the growth numbers are terrific across the board relative to our focus there. And as you look at market share increases, we've seen those in North America. We've seen those in Hill's. We're seeing those in Asia quite nicely. We're seeing those in Latin America. In fact, I got some India numbers that look outstanding.
So again, where we're focusing time and effort and certainly putting the investment there, we're seeing a good return on that. I think that bodes well as we continue to see the growth of e-commerce. We exited the year at double digit on e-commerce, and that number has accelerated in the first quarter. So I think the focus and strategies we have in place continue to be well received in the marketplace.
I'll give you 1 data point. We're up 260 basis points versus the first quarter last year on a percent of sales on our e-commerce business. So again, I think it's growing quite nicely and importantly, driving market share of new users into the franchise."

Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q2 performance as well as our latest thoughts on '21 guidance, before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on the current operating environment, and how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
As we report results at the halfway point of 2021, we remain pleased, but not satisfied, with our performance so far as we navigate through what can charitably be described as a complicated year. For both the second quarter and to-date basis, we delivered growth in organic sales, net sales, operating profit and net income. This is despite difficult comparisons, as we lap last year's strength in categories like liquid hand soap and dish soap. We are also dealing with the impact of COVID restrictions in several markets, economic and political uncertainty, strong competitive activity, and, of course, significantly heightened raw material and logistics headwinds. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our business through the second half of this year.
Because of that, we remain focused on delivering impactful innovation, leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to deliver on pricing and driving productivity up and down the income statement. All of these are crucial to deliver long-term sustainable growth that will help us as we look to deliver TSR at the high end of our peer group.
We delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter, which marked our tenth consecutive quarter delivering organic sales growth, either in or above our targeted range of 3% to 5%. As we have discussed before, the key to delivering against our long-term targets is delivering balanced growth, which we did once again in the quarter by delivering both volume and pricing growth. We delivered growth in both developed markets with 3% organic sales growth and emerging markets, which delivered 7% organic sales growth. We delivered organic sales growth in every division, but North America.
Our largest category, Oral Care, delivered organic sales growth of nearly 10%, with organic sales growth across toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes and organic sales growth in every division. Innovation continues to be a vital contributor to our Oral Care business as we benefit from new products across all of our divisions. Products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate electric toothpaste,and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste are all delivering consumer desired benefits and premiumizing our portfolio.
Pet Nutrition delivered organic sales growth of 15%. Personal Care & Home Care declined on an organic sales basis year-over-year in the quarter as expected, but net sales remain above 2019 levels. Net sales increased 9.5% in the quarter, which was our highest net sales increase in almost 10 years. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% benefit to net sales as we lapped the peak of last year's COVID-driven strength in the dollar.
After strong gross margin performance in 2020 and in Q1, our gross margin declined in the second quarter due to the rapid acceleration of raw material costs across our business and the lapping of lower promotional levels in Q2 2020. We took additional pricing in the second quarter, which will help offset raw material costs in the second half of the year, and we will continue to layer in additional pricing where possible. We expect raw material costs to remain elevated throughout 2021, but we do expect some sequential lessening of inflation as we get into the fourth quarter. Our efforts on premiumization and pricing, along with our focus on productivity, like our Funding the Growth initiative, will also help us as we look to improve our gross margin performance.
In the second quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.0%, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year on both a GAAP basis and a Base Business basis. Year-to-date, our gross margin is 60.4%, down 10 basis points. Again, that is on a GAAP and Base Business basis.
For the second quarter, pricing was 90 basis points favorable to gross margin, less than in the first quarter as we lap lower promotional spending in the year ago period when many of our markets reacted to COVID restrictions by pulling back on promotional activity. Raw materials were a 370 basis point headwind as we continue to see significant pressure from resins, fats and oils and agriculture-related costs and many other materials. This includes a slightly favorable transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 200 basis point benefit. Our SG&A was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales for the second quarter on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. This was primarily driven by increase in logistics costs and also by a 30 basis point increase in advertising to sales. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year as our net sales growth and savings programs drove leverage on our overheads.
For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 2.5% on a Base Business basis. Our EPS was up 12% on a GAAP basis and up 8% on a Base Business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continued to lap very strong working capital performance in the year ago period. As we discussed previously, our capital expenditures are also up year-over-year as we invest behind growth, productivity and our sustainability strategy.
A few comments on divisional performance. North America net sales declined 4% in the second quarter, with organic sales down 4.5% and a modest benefit from foreign exchange. Volumes were down 8.5% in the quarter, driven by Home Care and Personal Care, which saw strong growth in the year ago period driven by COVID-related demand. Pricing across Home Care and Personal Care was positive as we work to offset higher raw material costs. Oral Care organic sales grew mid-single digits, driven by innovation and pricing. I mentioned CO. by Colgate before, which is helping us further expand into the beauty and direct-to-consumer channels.
We are pleased with the initial performance of the Colgate teeth manual toothbrush. It comes with an aluminum handle. And by using our replaceable heads, consumer can use 80% less plastic compared to similarly-sized Colgate toothbrushes. We're also excited about our Tom's of Maine relaunch, which is bringing new graphics and advertising to a historic natural segment brand.
Our logistics issues that we discussed on the first quarter call continued to negatively impact our promotional timing, but service levels have improved, and we expect our promotional cadence will normalize as we go through the third quarter.
Latin America net sales were up 12.5%, with 8.5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All 3 categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high teens. Brazil and Mexico both grew organic and net sales double digits in the quarter. Our strong innovation performance was led by core innovation behind Colgate Total Reinforced Gums in Mexico, which apparently sounds much better in Spanish and Portuguese than English and several charcoal variants in Brazil.
Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, despite a sizable negative impact due to political unrest in Colombia, our third largest market in Latin America. We believe this disruption, which negatively impacted our distribution network for some time, is largely behind us, but political disruption will remain a risk, not just in Colombia, but in several markets.
Pricing was up 6% despite lapping lower promotional spending in Q2 2020 as well as some incremental pricing in the year ago period as we look to offset foreign exchange. Europe net sales grew 15% in the quarter. Organic sales grew 5%, driven by mid-teens growth in Oral Care, offset by declines in Personal and Home Care as we lapped COVID-related demand in the year-ago period. Volume grew 7% in the quarter, offset by a 2% decline in pricing as we lapped lower promotions in the year ago period as store traffic declined in Q2 2020 due to COVID restrictions.
I mentioned Colgate electric toothpaste before, and we're very excited about this truly differentiated product. We designed it with more of a beauty aesthetic, including skincare-inspired ingredients, a unique clear recyclable bottle and liquoglide technology that allows the paste to leave the bottle, leaving no messy tube or cap. This product began rolling out across the division in Q2, with further launches this quarter.
We delivered 7.5% net sales and 1% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific this quarter with organic growth in Oral Care, partially offset by a decline in Home Care. Volume growth of 3.5% was partly offset by negative pricing as we cycled lower promotional levels in the year ago period, given COVID-related lockdowns across the region, with the biggest impact coming on our South Pacific business. We have additional pricing planned in the second half across the division to offset raw material cost inflation.
Volume growth was led by India, despite the impact of COVID-related disruption in May in Thailand, driven by naturals innovation in the Colgate Vedshakti and Colgate Panjaved lines as we lap COVID-related disruptions in the year ago period. Our volume in China declined on growth on the Colgate business, which was more than offset by weakness in sales for our Holly and Hazel joint venture, which is primarily related to inventory reductions in our distributor network.
After Eurasia continued its strong performance trend in the third quarter, with net sales growth of 15.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division once again. Volume grew 9.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 3.5%. Foreign exchange was a 2.5% benefit in the quarter. Oral Care delivered high teens organic sales growth, and we are relaunching several of our naturals businesses with new packaging and flavors.
Hill's strong growth continued in the second quarter, with 18% net sales growth and 15% organic sales growth. Both developed and emerging markets delivered 10% volume growth as our increased investment around the globe is driving this highly differentiated brand. In particular, we are seeing good results from our Hill's master brand campaign to Pet obesity as well as our new campaign for Hill's Pet Essentials, our vent distributed wellness product in Europe. 
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. There is no meaningful change in our category expectations at this point. The categories that benefited from COVID-related demand are behaving in line with our expectations with sales below 2020 levels, but ahead of 2019 levels. Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in many of our markets, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID and other disruptions related to COVID, and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in April. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
We have reduced our gross margin guidance for the year, and we now expect gross margin to be down year-over-year for the full year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis, given the additional cost inflation we have seen. We expect the gross margin percentage to improve sequentially in the second half, which would leave us down modestly for the year.
As I mentioned above, we are taking many steps to mitigate the impact of these costs, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG were available and many others. Advertising is still expected to be up on both the dollar and a percent of sales basis. Logistics will continue to be a headwind as costs also have risen faster than anticipated, particularly in the U.S. We still expect these costs to moderate somewhat as we go through the balance of the year. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 23% and 24% for the year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis.
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits, but most likely towards the lower end of that range. On a Base Business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

I hope you're all safe and well this morning. So the overriding message I want to leave with you today is that our strategy to reaccelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core adjacencies all over the world, new channels and markets is really working. As we like to say, nothing moves in a straight line, but we now have 10 straight quarters of organic sales growth at or above our long-term target range.
Year-to-date, we're at the high end of the range despite difficult comparisons and continued volatility in the business. We're making good progress on our journey, but we still have more work to do.
And as I look back at my comments to you over the past 18 months that we've been dealing with the implications of COVID, the one consistent theme that we keep coming back to, managing through this crisis with an eye on the future. This is still the appropriate theme, although obviously, some of the elements have changed. The prevalence of the vaccine in many developed markets gives us a sense of guarded optimism, but we've highlighted that many emerging markets, which represent almost half of our revenues, the availability of the vaccine remains very low, case rates are high and governments continue to put in restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus. We remain hopeful that we will get to a post-COVID sooner rather than later, but we're not there yet.
We will continue to manage to the retail and supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, all while doing our best to protect the health and safety of our employees, which remains our #1 priority.
But there are changing headwinds as well. Last year, we were faced with adverse foreign exchange movements, heightened consumer and customer demand, supply chain volatility and uncertainty for our customers about changing business models and retail environments. This year, we're faced with unprecedented cost increases for raw materials like resin, fats and oils and many others. Logistic networks are taxed, whether it's the trucking and warehousing here in the U.S. or ocean freight coming from Asia to the rest of the world. And we're seeing some political disruption in markets like Colombia and Myanmar.
So 18 months into the COVID, many of the challenges are the same. Some have changed, but our approach remains we will manage through the crisis with an eye on the future. And so far, we feel we've done a pretty good job, but we know the markets look forward at our potential, not backwards at our achievements. We know that to deliver top-tier TSR, we need to balance organic sales growth, both volume and pricing, all 4 of our categories and across all of our divisions. We've talked to you a lot about our changes and strategy that will enable us to continue delivering this balanced growth.
First is our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation. John discussed many of these in his commentary, and this improved innovation is a direct result of the changes that Pat and I discussed during our CAGNY presentation. Our emphasis on faster-growing channels and markets continues to pay off through growth in e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, discounters, club stores and pharmacies. We're taking formerly regional brands like Tom's of Maine, Hello, Elmex and Merida and launching them in select markets and channels to take the advantage of their strong brand equities and ongoing consumer trends. We're supporting these efforts with increased focus on our digital media and emerging data and analytical capabilities.
But we have to deliver gross margin expansion to fund our brand investment. While we know -- while we now expect gross margin to be down modestly for 2021, it comes on the heels of strong gross margin expansion in 2020 and in the face of unprecedented increases in raw material prices. We will continue to leverage our robust revenue growth management program and drive productivity so we can return to gross margin expansion. We have made progress in our journey to improve our mix, but we have further upside potential on this given the benefits we provide to consumers and the fact that our brands under index in pricing relative to the category across many geographies.
We're working to accelerate our productivity programs by funding the growth wherever possible to try and create additional offsets. All this should help us in our drive to return to gross margin expansion. And while the raw material inflation is obviously negatively impacting our gross margin performance this year, we're optimistic that this raw material inflation could drive an improvement in emerging market fundamentals. Again, we need to first get through the difficulties surrounding COVID. But on the back of our continued rebound in emerging market organic sales growth, particularly in Latin America, we have some optimism that we could see some additional GDP growth and therefore, higher category growth on the back end of this movement in commodities. We have seen some of the emerging market currency stabilized for the first time in what seems like several years and are optimistic this may be a first step.
And since our last call, we have released our 2025 sustainability strategy. This comprehensive plan highlights the actions we're taking around climate, plastics, sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and all the older areas that are vital to the future, not only of our company but our communities and our planet.
And with that, I'll open it up to your questions."

I know it's not all the same category and country exposure, but the readthrough from a lot of other companies that have reported thus far was that the region was really strong, seeing better performance sequentially. So I know you mentioned Colombia.
So is there any way to quantify how much of a headwind you think the disruptions there caused in the quarter? And then maybe just more broadly, can you provide an update on your performance versus the category in the region? And how you're thinking about growth in the back half of the year, just kind of on the heels of your positive GDP commentary there, Noel?"

Thanks, Peter. Overall, we're really, really happy with Latin America. You mentioned that obviously, we saw significant headwinds from the Colombia disruption which, in many respects, took almost a month of sales out of that specific country. And despite that, we obviously still delivered very strong top line growth.
If you look at our 2 key markets, Mexico and Brazil, both delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. You've seen now Brazil delivered 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. So obviously, the market seems to be returning despite the fact that we're definitely not out of the woods relative to COVID. But we think as vaccinations improve, particularly in those markets, that will continue to help categories.
Categories are up on the year, which is good, despite the fact that we still see limited mobility. We still see some disruptions in particularly the down trade around how retail environments are behaving. But overall, the categories are up, which is good. We had strong innovation in the quarter. We had some good innovation on our core business, Colgate Total, which John mentioned, which is driving good share growth. We've resisted a little bit of the transactional couponing and deep discounting on some of those markets. So overall, we've lost a little bit of promotional share, but our baseline shares look good. And the innovation process of plans we have in place for the back half are strong as well. 
Likewise, on pricing, we've always been a strong driver of pricing in those markets. We continue to obviously see a lot of headwinds on commodity prices, particularly on towel prices coming out of Brazil. And we're ramping up for obviously a strong back half relative to how we see pricing evolving and obviously continuing to drive the volume in the quarter.
So overall, I think we're pleased, despite the fact that Colombia was a significant headwind to the quarter. Bear in mind, if you look at the overall Latin America, that region continues to perform exceptionally well on balance, 10 6 in the fourth quarter, 9 5 in the first and 8.5 now. So again, I think despite the headwinds, good consistent growth."

And when I say developed, I'm referring to Europe and the U.S. We've seen good pricing movements in Latin America, good pricing movements in Africa, and we've seen the competition, likewise, in those regions follow. 
Similarly, in Asia, John mentioned in the upfront comments that we took some pricing, obviously, in the first quarter. We were lapping promotions from the second quarter last year, although we have pricing planned quite aggressively in the back half across the Asia region.
If you take the developed world, U.S. has been a little slow in terms of the market. I think everyone is focusing on promotions and couponings to drive pricing. We haven't seen a lot of list price changes in North America yet. And I would say that particularly holds true for Europe as well.
Our strategy continues to be, as we've outlined, very disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We're taking list pricing where we see the opportunity. We're optimizing our promotional spend. We're looking at price pack architecture. We're looking at all the levers within -- in revenue growth managers to drive pricing overall.
The other point is, as you've heard, we're very focused on premium innovation. We continue to under-indexes I've mentioned, and that's a real opportunity for us to drive overall gross margin percent in dollars as we look at the back half of the year.
So I think the headline is pricing is going to have to come up in the back half. Everyone is faced with the same challenges. And we anticipate that as we move into the back half, we'll see a little bit better environment around developed markets and continue to focus on our revenue growth management discipline across the world to do that with."

We talked about, I think, throughout 2020 and perhaps touch on it a bit in the first quarter, the strength of our brands and the efficacy of our brands has certainly brought consumers back into the mainstream, so to speak. I mean a lot of the local brands, relative to the credibility they had in the market, which was questionable, we saw consumers returning to big brands and certainly trusted brands in the market. And that was very prevalent market -- in categories like Personal Care, like Home Care, like Pet Nutrition as well as Oral Care, quite frankly. And so that certainly has benefited us in terms of how we've seen the categories evolve.
And I think that will continue, particularly given the overarching issues around COVID around the world, consumers are still looking for big, trusted, efficacious brands, and we expect that to continue as we move through the balance of the year."

Obviously, the impact of logistics challenges that we alluded to in the first quarter.

We're working those behind us.
And as we move into the back half, those will be ideally gone. So we expect some of that to come back. We pushed a lot of the premiumization. That market has become highly competitive. We saw increased activity in promotion and couponing in the second quarter. We have adjusted our plans for the back half of the year, and our guidance reflects those plans for North America.
In -- likewise, in the dish business, we saw similar promotional activity. We've adjusted our promotional plans for the back half. So by and large, we saw obviously some logistics challenge, some competitive activity.

So as John alluded to in his comments, we did see some weakness in the China business from our Holly & Hazel partner. That was specifically driven by -- that's a business that's heavily driven downtrade. We have very strong distribution in CDE cities. And as we've seen e-commerce continue to grow, our distributor network has been cautious on managing inventories as we've seen the brick-and-mortar categories fundamentally flat, not growing so far in the first half of the year.
As e-commerce will potentially continue to accelerate and those inventories get drawn down, we expect that will sort of through in the back half of the year. Importantly, I think we're seeing terrific growth on our e-commerce business, as we talked about over the last couple of quarters. In fact, our Colgate franchise and our Darlie franchise were 2 of the 3 fastest-growing brands in e-commerce retail environment in the quarter and obviously up significantly versus where we were in the first quarter from a share standpoint, which is really nice to see. That's driven behind a lot of good premium innovation that we've had in the quarter.
The Miracle Repair continues to do well. We've launched a series of premium enzyme toothpaste as well. So that continues to perform well. And the advertising is there in the back half to continue to grow that business as we go out the year. So we're comfortable with where we are from an advertising standpoint. Obviously, the comps versus a quarter last year where we had drawn down a bit of our advertising. We saw a little bit of elevation in Asia in the second quarter, but good plans in the back half to continue to drive share."

Market share is up across the board, typically where we're getting market shares, namely in the U.S., which is our largest market, as you know. We saw good share growth across most retail environments, both on the Base Business, the Science Diet business as well as the Prescription Diet business. That's behind a continued focus on the strategy, which is the core renovation, premium innovation, new channels, in this case, continue to grow online as we in the Prescription Diet business, which has more and more pet owners returned to their vets, we see the benefit of that coming through as well.

I will provide commentary on our Q2 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on the current operating environment, and how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
As we report results at the halfway point of 2021, we remain pleased, but not satisfied, with our performance so far as we navigate through what can charitably be described as a complicated year. For both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we delivered growth in organic sales, net sales, operating profit and net income. This is despite difficult comparisons, as we lap last year's strength in categories like liquid hand soap and dish soap. We are also dealing with the impact of COVID restrictions in several markets, economic and political uncertainty, strong competitive activity and, of course, significantly heightened raw material and logistics headwinds.
We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our business through the second half of this year. Because of that, we remain focused on delivering impactful innovation, leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to deliver on pricing and driving productivity up and down the income statement. All of these are crucial to deliver long-term sustainable growth that will help us as we look to deliver TSR at the high end of our peer group.
We delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter, which marked our tenth consecutive quarter delivering organic sales growth, either in or above our targeted range of 3% to 5%. As we have discussed before, the key to delivering against our long-term targets is delivering balanced growth, which we did once again in the quarter by delivering both volume and pricing growth. We delivered growth in both developed markets with 3% organic sales growth in emerging markets, which delivered 7% organic sales growth. We delivered organic sales growth in every division, but North America.
Our largest category, Oral Care, delivered organic sales growth of nearly 10%, with organic sales growth across toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes and organic sales growth in every division. Innovation continues to be a vital contributor to our Oral Care business as we benefit from new products across all of our divisions. Products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate electric toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste are all delivering consumer desired benefits in premiumizing our portfolio.
Pet Nutrition delivered organic sales growth of 15%. Personal Care and Home Care declined on an organic sales basis year-over-year in the quarter as expected, but net sales remain above 2019 levels. Net sales increased 9.5% in the quarter, which was our highest net sales increase in almost 10 years. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% benefit to net sales as we lapped the peak of last year's COVID-driven strength in the dollar.
After strong gross margin performance in 2020 and in Q1, our gross margin declined in the second quarter due to the rapid acceleration of raw material costs across our business and the lapping of lower promotional levels in Q2 2020. We took additional pricing in the second quarter, which will help offset raw material costs in the second half of the year, and we will continue to layer in additional pricing where possible. We expect raw material costs to remain elevated throughout 2021, but we do expect some sequential lessening of inflation as we get into the fourth quarter. Our efforts on premiumization and pricing, along with our focus on productivity, like our Funding the Growth initiative, will also help us as we look to improve our gross margin performance.
In the second quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.0%, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year on both a GAAP basis and a Base Business basis. Year-to-date, our gross margin is 60.4%, down 10 basis points. Again, that is on a GAAP and Base Business basis.
For the second quarter, pricing was 90 basis points favorable to gross margin, less than in the first quarter as we lap lower promotional spending in the year ago period when many of our markets reacted to COVID restrictions by pulling back on promotional activity. Raw materials were a 370 basis point headwind as we continue to see significant pressure from resins, fats and oils and agriculture-related costs and many other materials. This includes a slightly favorable transactional impact from foreign exchange.
Productivity was a 200 basis point benefit. Our SG&A was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales for the second quarter on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. This was primarily driven by an increase in logistics costs and also by a 30 basis point increase in advertising to sales. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year as our net sales growth and savings programs drove leverage on our overheads.
For the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 2.5% on a Base Business basis. Our EPS was up 12% on a GAAP basis and up 8% on a Base Business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continued to lap very strong working capital performance in the year ago period. As we discussed previously, our capital expenditures are also up year-over-year as we invest behind growth, productivity and our sustainability strategy.
A few comments on divisional performance. North America net sales declined 4% in the second quarter, with organic sales down 4.5% and a modest benefit from foreign exchange. Volumes were down 8.5% in the quarter, driven by Home Care and Personal Care, which saw strong growth in the year ago period driven by COVID-related demand. Pricing across Home Care and Personal Care was positive as we work to offset higher raw material costs. Oral Care organic sales grew mid-single digits, driven by innovation and pricing. I mentioned CO. by Colgate before, which is helping us further expand into the beauty and direct-to-consumer channels.
We are pleased with the initial performance of the Colgate teeth manual toothbrush. It comes with an aluminum handle. And by using our replaceable heads, consumer can use 80% less plastic compared to similarly-sized Colgate toothbrushes. We're also excited about our Tom's of Maine relaunch, which is bringing new graphics and advertising to a historic natural segment brand.
Our logistics issues that we discussed on the first quarter call continued to negatively impact our promotional timing, but service levels have improved and we expect our promotional cadence will normalize as we go through the third quarter.
Latin America net sales were up 12.5%, with 8.5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All 3 categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high teens. Brazil and Mexico both grew organic and net sales double digits in the quarter. Our strong innovation performance was led by core innovation behind Colgate Total Reinforced Gums in Mexico, which apparently sounds much better in Spanish and Portuguese than English and several charcoal variants in Brazil.
Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, despite a sizable negative impact due to political unrest in Colombia, our third largest market in Latin America. We believe this disruption, which negatively impacted our distribution network for some time, is largely behind us, but political disruption will remain a risk, not just in Colombia, but in several markets.
Pricing was up 6% despite lapping lower promotional spending in Q2 2020 as well as some incremental pricing in the year ago period as we look to offset foreign exchange. Europe net sales grew 15% in the quarter. Organic sales grew 5%, driven by mid-teens growth in Oral Care, offset by declines in Personal and Home Care as we lapped COVID-related demand in the year ago period. Volume grew 7% in the quarter, offset by a 2% decline in pricing as we lapped lower promotions in the year ago period as store traffic declined in Q2 2020 due to COVID restrictions.
I mentioned Colgate electric toothpaste before, and we're very excited about this truly differentiated product. We designed it with more of a beauty aesthetic, including skincare-inspired ingredients, a unique clear recyclable bottle and LiquiGlide technology that allows the paste to leave the bottle, leaving no messy tube or cap. This product began rolling out across the division in Q2, with further launches this quarter.
We delivered 7.5% net sales and 1% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific this quarter with organic growth in Oral Care partially offset by a decline in Home Care. Volume growth of 3.5% was partly offset by negative pricing as we cycled lower promotional levels than a year ago period, given COVID-related lockdowns across the region, with the biggest impact coming on our South Pacific business. We have additional pricing planned in the second half across the division to offset raw material cost inflation.
Volume growth was led by India, despite the impact of COVID-related disruption in May in Thailand, driven by naturals innovation in the Colgate Vedshakti and Colgate Panjaved lines as we lap COVID-related disruptions in the year ago period. Our volume in China declined on growth on the Colgate business, which was more than offset by weakness in sales for our Hawley & Hazel joint venture, which is primarily related to inventory reductions in our distributor network.
Africa/Eurasia continued its strong performance trend in the third quarter with net sales growth of 15.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division once again. Volume grew 9.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 3.5%. Foreign exchange was a 2.5% benefit in the quarter. Oral Care delivered high teens organic sales growth, and we are relaunching several of our naturals businesses with new packaging and flavors.
Hill's strong growth continued in the second quarter, with 18% net sales growth and 15% organic sales growth. Both developed and emerging markets delivered 10% volume growth as our increased investment around the globe is driving this highly differentiated brand. In particular, we are seeing good results from our Hill's master brand campaign to end pet obesity as well as our new campaign for Hill's pet essentials, our vet distributed wellness product in Europe.
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. There is no meaningful change in our category expectations at this point. The categories that benefited from COVID-related demand are behaving in line with our expectations with sales below 2020 levels, but ahead of 2019 levels. Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in many of our markets, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID and other disruptions related to COVID, and this is not in our guidance.
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in April. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%.
We have reduced our gross margin guidance for the year, and we now expect gross margin to be down year-over-year for the full year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis, given the additional cost inflation we have seen. We expect the gross margin percentage to improve sequentially in the second half, which would leave us down modestly for the year.
As I mentioned above, we are taking many steps to mitigate the impact of these costs, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG were available and many others. Advertising is still expected to be up on both the dollar and a percent of sales basis. Logistics will continue to be a headwind as costs also have risen faster than anticipated, particularly in the U.S. We still expect these costs to moderate somewhat as we go through the balance of the year. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 23% and 24% for the year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis.
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits, but most likely towards the lower end of that range. On a Base Business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

I hope you're all safe and well this morning. So the overriding message I want to leave with you today is that our strategy to reaccelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core adjacencies all over the world, new channels and markets is really working. As we like to say, nothing moves in a straight line, but we now have 10 straight quarters of organic sales growth at or above our long-term target range.
Year-to-date, we're at the high end of the range despite difficult comparisons and continued volatility in the business. We're making good progress on our journey, but we still have more work to do.
And as I look back at my comments to you over the past 18 months that we've been dealing with the implications of COVID, the one consistent theme that we keep coming back to, managing through this crisis with an eye on the future. This is still the appropriate theme, although obviously, some of the elements have changed. The prevalence of the vaccine in many developed markets gives us a sense of guarded optimism, but we've highlighted that many emerging markets, which represent almost half of our revenues, the availability of the vaccine remains very low, case rates are high and governments continue to put in restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus. We remain hopeful that we will get to a post-COVID sooner rather than later, but we're not there yet.
We will continue to manage to the retail and supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, all while doing our best to protect the health and safety of our employees, which remains our #1 priority.
But there are changing headwinds as well. Last year, we were faced with adverse foreign exchange movements, heightened consumer and customer demand, supply chain volatility and uncertainty for our customers about changing business models and retail environments. This year, we're faced with unprecedented cost increases for raw materials like resin, fats and oils and many others. Logistic networks are taxed, whether it's the trucking and warehousing here in the U.S. or ocean freight coming from Asia to the rest of the world. And we're seeing some political disruption in markets like Colombia and Myanmar.
So 18 months into the COVID, many of the challenges are the same. Some have changed, but our approach remains. We will manage through the crisis with an eye on the future. And so far, we feel we've done a pretty good job, but we know the markets look forward at our potential, not backwards at our achievements. We know that to deliver top-tier TSR, we need to balance organic sales growth, both volume and pricing, all 4 of our categories and across all of our divisions. We've talked to you a lot about our changes and strategy that will enable us to continue delivering this balanced growth.
First is our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation. John discussed many of these in his commentary, and this improved innovation is a direct result of the changes that Pat and I discussed during our CAGNY presentation. Our emphasis on faster-growing channels and markets continues to pay off through growth in e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, discounters, club stores and pharmacies. We're taking formerly regional brands like Tom's of Maine, Hello, elmex and meridol and launching them in select markets and channels to take the advantage of their strong brand equities and ongoing consumer trends. We're supporting these efforts with increased focus on our digital media and emerging data and analytical capabilities.
But we have to deliver gross margin expansion to fund our brand investment. While we know -- while we now expect gross margin to be down modestly for 2021, it comes on the heels of strong gross margin expansion in 2020 and in the face of unprecedented increases in raw material prices. We will continue to leverage our robust revenue growth management program and drive productivity so we can return to gross margin expansion. We have made progress in our journey to improve our mix, but we have further upside potential on this given the benefits we provide to consumers and the fact that our brands under index in pricing relative to the category across many geographies.
We're working to accelerate our productivity programs like Funding the Growth wherever possible to try and create additional offsets. All this should help us in our drive to return to gross margin expansion. And while the raw material inflation is obviously negatively impacting our gross margin performance this year, we're optimistic that this raw material inflation could drive an improvement in emerging market fundamentals. Again, we need to first get through the difficulties surrounding COVID. But on the back of our continued rebound in emerging market organic sales growth, particularly in Latin America, we have some optimism that we could see some additional GDP growth and, therefore, higher category growth on the back end of this movement in commodities. We have seen some of the emerging market currency stabilized for the first time in what seems like several years and are optimistic this may be a first step.
And since our last call, we have released our 2025 sustainability strategy. This comprehensive plan highlights the actions we're taking around climate, plastics, sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and all other areas that are vital to the future, not only of our company but our communities and our planet.
And with that, I'll open it up to your questions."

I know it's not all the same category and country exposure, but the readthrough from a lot of other companies that have reported thus far was that the region was really strong, like most seeing better performance sequentially. So I know you mentioned Colombia.
So is there any way to quantify how much of a headwind you think the disruptions there caused in the quarter? And then maybe just more broadly, can you provide an update on your performance versus the category in the region? And how you're thinking about growth in the back half of the year, just kind of on the heels of your positive GDP commentary there, Noel?"

Thanks, Peter. Overall, we're really, really happy with Latin America. You mentioned that, obviously, we saw significant headwinds from the Colombia disruption, which, in many respects, took almost a month of sales out of that specific country. And despite that, we obviously still delivered very strong top line growth.
If you look at our 2 key markets, Mexico and Brazil, both delivering double-digit growth in the quarter, you've seen now Brazil delivered 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. So obviously, the market seems to be returning despite the fact that we're definitely not out of the woods relative to COVID. But we think as vaccinations improve, particularly in those markets, that will continue to help categories.
Categories are up on the year, which is good, despite the fact that we still see limited mobility. We still see some disruptions in particularly the down trade around how retail environments are behaving. But overall, the categories are up, which is good. We had strong innovation in the quarter. We had some good innovation on our core business, Colgate Total, which John mentioned, which is driving good share growth. We've resisted a little bit of the transactional couponing and deep discounting in some of those markets. So overall, we've lost a little bit of promotional share, but our baseline shares look good. And the innovation process -- plans we have in place for the back half are strong as well.
Likewise, on pricing, we've always been a strong driver of pricing in those markets. We continue to, obviously, see a lot of headwinds on commodity prices, particularly on towel prices coming out of Brazil. And we're ramping up for obviously a strong back half relative to how we see pricing evolving and obviously continuing to drive the volume in the quarter.
So overall, I think we're pleased, despite the fact that Colombia was a significant headwind to the quarter. Bear in mind, if you look at the overall Latin America, that region continues to perform exceptionally well on balance, 10-6 in the fourth quarter, 9-5 in the first and 8.5 now. So again, I think despite the headwinds, good consistent growth."

Obviously, if you look at developing markets versus developed, developing have obviously moved pricing a little faster than the developed world. And when I say developed, I'm referring to Europe and the U.S. We've seen good pricing movements in Latin America, good pricing movements in Africa, and we've seen the competition, likewise, in those regions follow.
Similarly, in Asia, John mentioned in the upfront comments that we took some pricing, obviously, in the first quarter. We were lapping promotions from the second quarter last year, although we have pricing planned quite aggressively in the back half across the Asia region.
If you take the developed world, U.S. has been a little slow in terms of the market. I think everyone is focusing on promotions and couponings to drive pricing. We haven't seen a lot of list price changes in North America yet. And I would say that particularly holds true for Europe as well.
Our strategy continues to be, as we've outlined, very disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We're taking list pricing where we see the opportunity. We're optimizing our promotional spend. We're looking at price pack architecture. We're looking at all the levers within -- in revenue growth managers to drive pricing overall.
The other point is, as you've heard, we're very focused on premium innovation. We continue to under-indexes I've mentioned, and that's a real opportunity for us to drive overall gross margin percent in dollars as we look at the back half of the year.
So I think the headline is pricing is going to have to come up in the back half. Everyone is faced with the same challenges. And we anticipate that as we move into the back half, we'll see a little bit better environment around developed markets and continue to focus on our revenue growth management discipline across the world to do that with."

I mean a lot of the local brands, relative to the credibility they had in the market, which was questionable, we saw consumers returning to big brands and certainly trusted brands in the market. And that was very prevalent in market -- in categories like Personal Care, like Home Care, like Pet Nutrition as well as Oral Care, quite frankly. And so that certainly has benefited us in terms of how we've seen the categories evolve.
And I think that will continue, particularly given the overarching issues around COVID around the world, consumers are still looking for big, trusted, efficacious brands, and we expect that to continue as we move through the balance of the year."

We're working those behind us. And as we move into the back half, those will be ideally gone. So we expect some of that to come back.
We pushed a lot of the premiumization. That market has become highly competitive. We saw increased activity in promotion and couponing in the second quarter. We have adjusted our plans for the back half of the year, and our guidance reflects those plans for North America.
In -- likewise, in the dish business, we saw similar promotional activity. We've adjusted our promotional plans for the back half.

So as John alluded to in his comments, we did see some weakness in the China business from our Hawley & Hazel partner. That was specifically driven by -- that's a business that's heavily driven downtrade. We have very strong distribution in CDE cities. And as we've seen e-commerce continue to grow, our distributor network has been cautious on managing inventories as we've seen the brick-and-mortar categories fundamentally flat, not growing so far in the first half of the year.
As e-commerce will potentially continue to accelerate and those inventories get drawn down, we expect that will sort its way through in the back half of the year. Importantly, I think we're seeing terrific growth on our e-commerce business, as we've talked about over the last couple of quarters. In fact, our Colgate franchise and our Darlie franchise were 2 of the 3 fastest-growing brands in e-commerce retail environment in the quarter and obviously up significantly versus where we were in the first quarter from a share standpoint, which is really nice to see. That's driven behind a lot of good premium innovation that we've had in the quarter.
The Miracle Repair continues to do well. We've launched a series of premium enzyme toothpaste as well. So that continues to perform well. And the advertising is there in the back half to continue to grow that business as we go out the year. So we're comfortable with where we are from an advertising standpoint. Obviously, the comps versus a quarter last year where we had drawn down a bit of our advertising, we saw a little bit of elevation in Asia in the second quarter, but good plans in the back half to continue to drive share."

This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 in the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. 
As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue. 
Our focus on innovation, premiumization, pricing and productivity allowed us to deliver solid Q3 and year-to-date results despite a very difficult operating environment. We continue to deliver against our targets because we are executing consistently on the strategy, Noel laid out at CAGNY back in 2019. We are focused on delivering consistent, sustainable, profitable growth, both volume and pricing growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions emerging in developed markets. And this has enabled us to deliver 11 straight quarters with organic sales growth in line with or above our long-term target of 3% to 5%. This is despite very difficult comparisons and a challenging operating environment. 
The current operating environment is challenging in many different ways. Consumer mobility is limited in many markets, particularly in Asia, due to government restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19, which is having a negative impact on category growth. These restrictions have also led to temporary closure of manufacturing facilities across many industries, as you have heard in the news, and from other companies. We are not immune to these restrictions, although given the essential nature of our categories,  we produce products that people and their pets used on a daily basis to lead healthier lives, we have been able to resume production throughout our network, although sometimes at a lower than normal level. This did have a slight impact on sales in the third quarter and we expect a modest impact in the fourth quarter as we ramp production back up. 
We are fortunate to have a flexible and resilient global supply chain that has helped us to offset some of the effects of these supply chain challenges, albeit sometimes with additional logistics costs. Speaking of logistics, the stress on global logistics networks is creating shortages of raw materials, lengthening shipment times, increasing costs and adding additional uncertainty. All of this is on top of the significant increases in raw material costs and continued movement in foreign exchange. These challenges will continue into next year, but we will continue to meet them head on. 
Our net sales grew 6.5% in the quarter, driven by 4.5% organic sales growth and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the third quarter was led by Oral Care, where we were up mid-single digits and Pet Nutrition, where we were up double digits. We delivered organic sales growth in Home Care despite a difficult comparison, which puts our Home Care business at double-digit growth on a 2-year stack. 
As expected, organic sales in Personal Care declined mid-single digits as we lapped the COVID-related growth in liquid hand soap in the year ago period, but sales remain above 2019 levels. We grew volume 1.5% in the quarter. Pricing grew 3% in the quarter, up sequentially from Q2 despite a more difficult 4.5% comparison, as we continue to layer in new pricing to try to offset accelerating raw material costs. Pricing was up in every category and every division. 
Raw materials continued to increase in Q3,  putting further pressure on our gross margins despite additional pricing and productivity efforts. Our gross margin was down 180 basis points in the quarter. Pricing was a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 510 basis point headwind despite a slight benefit from transactional foreign exchange. Productivity was favorable by 220 basis points. On a GAAP and base business basis,  our SG&A was up 50 basis points on a percent of sales driven by significant increase in logistics costs as advertising was up on a dollar basis but flat on a percent of sales basis. 
Excluding logistics and advertising, our overheads were down slightly on a dollar basis and down nicely on a percent of sales basis. We continue to increase our investments in capabilities like digital, e-commerce and data and analytics but this was more than offset by sales leverage and tight expense controls. 
For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was down 5% year-over-year, while it was down 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 7% on a GAAP basis and up 3% on a base business basis. 
A few comments on our divisional performance. Net sales in North America grew 1% in the third quarter with organic sales growth of 0.5% and 50 basis points of favorable foreign exchange. Volumes were flat in the quarter despite a negative nearly 400 basis point impact from lower liquid hand soap volumes, while pricing was slightly favorable. We made significant progress on our North American business in the quarter with solid oral care growth, driven by mid-single-digit growth in toothpaste, which led to improved toothpaste market share performance through the quarter. Personal Care and Home Care were both down as we lapped COVID benefits in the year ago period, although EltaMD and PCA Skin delivered strong growth in the quarter. 
North America operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and higher logistics costs. The impact of plant closures on our global supply chain required us to incur additional air freight charges to fulfill customer orders in the quarter. We also incurred some additional manufacturing costs in the quarter that should help improve the long-term profitability of the division. Latin America net sales were up 11%, with 8% organic sales growth, and a 300 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All 3 categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with oral care organic sales growth in the high single digits. Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 5.5%. Brazil and Mexico led the growth in the quarter, while Colombia delivered double-digit growth following last quarter's political unrest. The Natural segment continues to be a key driver of growth for us across Latin America, particularly Colgate Natural Extracts Charcoal. And we recently launched Colgate Zero toothpaste in Brazil. 
Our strong Latin America pricing growth highlights the success of our revenue growth management program with a combination of list price increases, premium innovation and trade promo adjustments. Europe net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 1%, and foreign exchange adding 2%. Volume was down 1% and pricing was flat. Oral Care organic sales grew high single digits, while Personal Care organic sales were down sharply, driven by difficult liquid hand soap comparisons due to COVID-related consumption in the year ago period and a decline in Filorga duty-free sales. 
Colgate Elixir toothpaste continued to drive growth in the quarter, along with strong contributions from elmex and Meridol. Asia Pacific net sales grew 1% and organic sales declined 0.5% in the quarter, with volume down slightly and pricing in foreign exchange, both slightly positive. Oral Care saw low single-digit organic sales growth in the quarter, while Personal Care and Home Care were down due to difficult COVID comparisons. 
We did see government-imposed mobility restrictions negatively impacting category volumes in several markets, including many in Southeast Asia. India and the Colgate China business both delivered strong volume growth behind robust innovation in the -- segment in India and in e-commerce in China. Our Hawley & Hazel JV saw significantly improved performance in Q3 versus Q2, with trends also improving sequentially through the quarter. Africa/Eurasia net sales grew 1% in the quarter,  with an organic sales decline of 1%, lapping double-digit organic growth in the year ago period, more than offset by a 2% positive impact from foreign exchange. Volumes were minus 4.5%, while pricing was plus 3.5%. The organic sales growth decline in the quarter was driven by Personal Care, as we lapped double-digit growth in the year ago period due to COVID-related demand and pricing. 
Oral Care organic sales in the quarter were flat as disruptions in the global supply chain had a negative impact on product availability. Hill's strong growth continued in the third quarter with 20% net sales growth and 19% organic sales growth, with strong growth in both emerging and developed markets. Organic sales growth was driven by double-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing through list price increases and our premiumization strategies. 
Our focus on the microbiome, which Pat Burton talked about during our CAGNY presentation this year, continues to pay dividends with the Active Biome Plus technology, including in Hill's Prescription Diet gastrointestinal biome and Hill's Science Diet -- Perfect Digestion, both of which are driving sales growth and share in this important segment. 
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As I mentioned previously, we have seen an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID-19, including reduced consumer mobility and supply chain interruptions. We are managing through these issues, but we would expect modest headwinds from this to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in July. Please note that at current spot rates, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on Q4. 
All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. Given the continued pressures from raw materials, we are projecting a greater decline in gross margin than when we last gave guidance in July. Fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be roughly in line with the third quarter, although the raw material situation remains very difficult. 
We continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG were available and many others. We are focused on recouping the gross margin we have lost due to cost inflation over time and are planning to take the actions necessary to do so. Advertising is still expected to be up on a dollar basis but flat on a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 23% for the year on both a GAAP and base business basis. 
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. And as we said on the second quarter call, towards the lower end of that range. On a base business basis,  we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

So what I take away from our performance, I guess both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic and operational journey despite the significant volatility we are encountering across our entire business. 
At the heart of this is our strategy to deliver broad-based sustainable profitable growth, every division, every category, both volume and pricing. That's our aspiration. And over the past few years, we have changed our mindset about how we drive growth. We're more proactive in attacking the opportunities for growth, think core, premium adjacencies, faster alternative channels and markets, and of course, we talked a lot about building capabilities. Think digital, data, e-commerce, innovation. All of these are helping us mine these important areas of growth. While locking our most difficult comparisons in over a decade, we've delivered organic sales growth at the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. And on a 2-year basis, both pricing and volume growth increased sequentially in the quarter. Importantly, this growth is being driven by our 2 most important categories, Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. 
Oral Care organic sales were up mid-single digits in Q3 and against the mid-single-digit comparison and are up high single digits year-to-date. We're driving this growth through more impactful innovation, share growth in faster-growth channels like e-commerce and pharmacies and higher, more efficient marketing spending. Our premiumization strategy is paying off with our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, changing how we interact with the people who use our products. A great example of this is how we've changed our approach to whitening. In the U.S., you're familiar with Optic White Renewal, which has done incredibly well. Outside the U.S., the story needs to be more about just hydrogen peroxide levels. In China, it's about enzyme-based whitening. In other markets, we have whitening products targeted towards consumers who would love tea or coffee or consumers who love wine or tobacco. We're targeting the whitening opportunity much more broadly with new technologies, formulations and delivery systems, expanding our growth potential. 
Pet Nutrition organic sales growth was up 19% in the quarter against an 11% comparison and is now up 14% year-to-date through quarter 3. This growth is driven by Hill's science-based equity messaging behind our core. It's driven by meaningful premium innovation and the continued expertise of our digital and e-commerce teams. The launch of Prescription Diet Derm complete, those breakthrough therapeutic nutrition for both food and environmental sensitivities has led to share gains in the category and is being rolled out internationally over the next few quarters. Hill's goal of ending pet obesity where studies show over 50% of pets who are overweight is the impetus for our Hill's master brand campaign. This campaign has been rolled out globally and has driven growth in both our therapeutic and wellness anti-obesity products. 
In this type of environment, we couldn't deliver the results without -- this year without the amazing work done by Colgate people every day. Our customer development organization is reacting quickly to the changing cost environment so we can take pricing as part of the revenue growth management initiative. Marketing and R&D are working together to accelerate the launch of premium innovation to drive mix and profitability. And most importantly, our global supply chain team has delivered these results despite freight and logistics disruptions, plant closures, congested ports and supplier outages. Importantly, all the efforts we have put into building capabilities over the past few years is not just about driving growth. It's also about creating an organization that can respond more rapidly to all these challenges we face around the world. 
For example, our focus on data and analytics is helping our revenue growth management program pinpoint the best opportunities for incremental pricing as costs continue to rise. We're getting this pricing out in the market more quickly and the data that drives the process gives our people on the ground more confidence in their decisions. 
Our investment in e-commerce and digital marketing continues to pay off. In our 6 largest e-commerce markets for Oral Care,  we finished the third quarter with year-to-date net sales already ahead of '22 net sales -- 2020 net sales, and toothpaste share growth in 5 of the 6 markets. 
We've implemented a new media vine strategy to drive efficiencies, both online and offline and launched a 4-tier training program to enable 14,000 of our employees to help drive our digital strategy. As I've said,  the key to all of this is that we recognize that the strategy is working. And while we address the pressing issues of raw materials, logistics and supply chain, we can't lose sight of our long-term areas of focus. Our innovation calendar for 2022 will show an increase in the percentage of innovation that is breakthrough and transformational. We've announced our new sustainability and social impact strategy this year, which includes 11 new targets and actions in areas like zero waste, climate change, using less plastic as well as Bright Smiles, Bright Futures and our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. And we will continue to build our people and capabilities through new ways of working that are truly changing how Colgate people do their jobs. 
2021 has been a very challenging year for us, and many of these challenges will continue in 2022, but I'm confident of the changes that Colgate people put in place over the past several years, which will allow us to continue to deliver our goal of sustainable, profitable growth. And now I'll open it up for questions."

So overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making on Oral Care, particularly in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. If you take our shares on a constant currency basis, they're relatively flat, which is better than where we had been.  When you start to go around the world, particularly as you look at new channels, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in e-commerce and pharmacy. So let's just bounce around the world a bit. North America still has been a little bit soft, but we've seen the shares bounce back nicely in the last 13 weeks, and where our shares are actually flat now on an all outlet basis, if you take e-commerce and all the untracked channels. Our estimation is our shares are back to flat in the U.S., slightly up, which is good progress, particularly as we've seen the acceleration of some of the premium SKUs that we've launched in the market, particularly whitening over the last 13 weeks. And likewise, our e-commerce shares continue to be good, not as strong as our general market but progressing in North America. 
Europe, the shares have been strong. Our elmex -- our strategy behind elmex and meridol has been very successful in pushing those businesses across all of our core markets. Our shares continue to be up across that region, and we continue to see the shift toward our premium bundles which was, again, part of the strategy change that we outlined back at CAGNY that we were going to focus on underserved channels like pharmacy with some of our premium therapeutic equities, like meridol and elmex. 
Latin America, the shares continue to be very strong, flat in the quarter, slightly down as a result of some of the promotional volume that we've given up in Mexico, which has been quite significant, but Brazil shares continue to be pretty good and trending nicely, particularly behind strong revenue growth management initiatives that have characterized the Brazilian subsidiary for so long, but overall, pretty good. 
Africa, pretty good, good shares in South Africa, better shares in Russia as we move to a premiumization strategy there. So we're pleased with that aspect as well. China has been a terrific performance in the quarter for us, Dara. We've seen our e-commerce shares across both the Hawley & Hazel joint venture as well as the Colgate franchise, be the fastest-growing SKUs in the market. We are the fastest-growing manufacturer in the market. 
Our shares on the Colgate business in China now are up after many years of declines when you combine both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. So overall, very pleased. And again, I think that's a testament to the strategy and the strategic changes we made with our portfolio. Remember that a big focus in China was getting the premiumization part of the portfolio fixed. The growth in e-commerce has all been premium SKUs, which priced at about 300 index to the general market. So again, I think good innovation at that end of the market is helping to drive our business. And you heard in the upfront comments, obviously, e-commerce across the world once again is driving nice shares for us, particularly in oral care, where we've had a lot of focus. 
Coming back to the question around the strategy on Oral Care. Again, the focus was premium, innovation and new channels. And if you take our pharmacy growth across the world in toothpaste, very strong, particularly in key markets where we're really focused, which have been in Africa, Europe and Latin America, particularly Brazil. You see our pharmacy shares continuing to grow, and we've got a good pipeline of innovation coming in 2022 that's going to be specifically tailored towards pharmacy growth. And likewise, e-commerce being the other fast growth channel and obviously just articulated the success we're having there. 
Therapeutic was the other big focus that we had in CAGNY in terms of where we're going to push the oral care business, particularly toothpaste. We've expanded meridol and elmex strategically into core markets where we see big pharmacy classes of trade and where we see the therapeutic segment growing, and our success has been quite notable, particularly in those markets, whether you look at Brazil specifically, whether you look at the Middle East where we've been quite successful as well. So again, I think that strategy seems to be taking hold. 
Naturals has, quite frankly, been a little bit soft, and I think that's coming out of the COVID period where consumers traded to more therapeutic efficacious brand, so to speak. And the natural segment was  softer than we would have expected. So Hello here in North America, shares are stable, but not growing as much as we anticipated. We did indicate that we're rolling that out selectively into some core markets around the world, and that will unfold in the balance of this quarter and into the first quarter of next year. 
So overall, I think the strategies that we outlined are working, certainly, as you've seen from the results there, mid-single digits in the quarter and high single on the year for Oral Care, which has been absolutely terrific and consistent, and that is on top of a marketplace that, quite frankly, is growing considerably below that right now. So again, we think we're driving share globally on when you look at it on an all outlet basis, particularly given the organic growth sequential improvements that we're seeing."

And we're certainly not immune to that. And -- but what we are very good at is pricing. And you've seen that consistently over time and time over the years, whether it's foreign exchange inflation or raw and packing material inflation, we have found ways over time to recover that in our margin line. And that is certainly the focus right now in the business. 
The good news is when you have an inflationary environment that's indexed around raw materials, you tend to have everyone looking to take pricing in the market, and that makes it more conducive certainly from a category standpoint and making sure that as everyone takes pricing, that the volume continues to go along with that. So we're pleased that we've seen pricing in the marketplace. We've been leading that across the board, quite frankly, particularly in the emerging markets where we've taken pricing quite aggressively throughout the first half and very much into the third quarter, and we've laid out pricing for the fourth quarter and into early 2022. So we'll see the margins begin to recover. Now the environment you've heard around raw materials and logistics continues to be extremely volatile. And we anticipate that we'll continue to see some headwinds in that space. 
The team understands that and is putting the strategies into place, in order to recover margins as we move forward. We will also be heightening our focus around revenue growth management, that discipline is going to be really embedded much more so, given the fact that we've now put some analytical processes in place to help the teams, as I outlined, which we think is terrific. It will give the teams a lot more confidence on the pricing that we're taking to ensure that we're working with our trade partners to grow category at the same time as we take pricing to recover costs. So we're pleased with that. 
Likewise, had a lot of discussions over the last couple of months on our grids, our new product grids, relative to premium innovation and making sure that we continue to focus on that area of the business, where, as you know, historically, we have under-indexed, and we've seen good progress against that, particularly as you look at some of the premium businesses that we have around the world, whether it be elmex, meridol or some of the prices we've taken on our therapeutic bundles within the Colgate portfolio. So overall, a tough raw material environment will continue to be very choppy, but we're very focused in terms of taking pricing and ensuring that we push our premium innovation moving forward."

You've come to know Colgate and the fact that we consider our supply chain a competitive advantage for us, and that is the fact that we operate globally with some of the most efficient facilities around the world. And the benefit of that has obviously translated into the strong gross margin progression that we've seen over the years. That being said, when you operate a global supply chain, you're not immune to decisions taken locally that will impact that. And obviously, in Asia, where we have seen governments taking actions to stop the spread of COVID, whether it be that or obviously impacting some of our suppliers and our third-party contractors, we've seen disruption in the supply chain. And as a result of that, we have the contingencies in place to move that production elsewhere, which the team has done just a tremendous job in servicing the sales need of the business. And you've seen that obviously in the acceleration or the continuous good top line growth that we've had, and that's a function of our supply chain, ensuring that we meet the demand of our products and our retailers. And we moved production around the world to do that. That comes with a cost that certainly we incurred in the quarter. 
Some of the disruptions specifically related to what we've referred to in our commentary. We're moving through those very quickly. We have moved behind one that was quite significant, and we're back to where we needed to be in terms of output, and we're back to pretty close on some of the other ones. We expect that to be fully back in capacity by the end of the quarter, this quarter. But that being said, the environment is very unpredictable. And we'll continue to try to anticipate some of these things moving forward as we've done but one can never be for sure when a government decides to come in and shut down a province or an area based on their needs. Likewise, this has a big impact, obviously, on the rest of the supply chain, whether it be raw material sourcing, whether it be our contractors. You heard in John's commentary, we did take some decisions, particularly in North America around some of the contractors that we use in order to clean that up and move into a supply chain strategy that allows us to exit some of those and get more efficiencies moving forward. So we're taking all the right decisions, moving through the issues that we had in the third quarter, but we're not immune to the unpredictability of the supply chain environment that everyone is faced with today."

I think a lot of the change in strategies that we deployed a couple of years ago, which again, are based foundationally on exactly all the stuff we're trying to deploy across the world, really working on the core of our business, looking at premium innovation and continuing to really dial up our focus on high-growth channels. And that's exactly what's unfolded over the last couple of years, and that strategy is continuing, obviously, to get sharper and sharper as we execute it more broadly across the Hill's network around the world. 
A lot of that growth has come out of North America, which has been terrific. I mean, the double-digit growth compounding each other. The U.S. had another outstanding quarter in the third quarter. Again, we're benefiting from a quite buoyant category, but the important part that you called out is we're growing share quite consistently not only across our wellness products or our core products but also our therapeutic products and prescription diet. We're seeing, obviously, veterinarians open back up. That is certainly improving the consumption of our prescription diet. We talked at length about the innovation process we had behind Hill's, which I think is second to none in the category right now bringing real science and real therapeutic benefits to pet owners, and we're seeing that translate into obviously more penetration and growing share. 
We continue to talk about the low awareness of Hill's, both in North America and around the world. That affords us a significant opportunity as we continue to build that brand consistently all over the world, and we're continuing to invest behind that business. Despite the fact that raw materials are a headwind, we're not going to jeopardize the health of the brand by cutting back on our investment. We will continue to invest to grow awareness and that ultimately is growing penetration in the category. So we feel very good about where we are. 
Obviously, the comparisons continue to get tough. But those have been tough continue to see good progress on the strategy, our ability to take pricing and our ability to bring in new consumers to the franchise."

I think you just noted there was some efficiencies with contract manufacturers. But the comment was in the prepared remarks, I believe, to improve the long-term profitability of that business. And I was wondering if you could just expand on that. 
Do you think like a lack of scale or efficiency or something else in the manufacturing base has been a cause of the margin compression in that business. And do you have opportunities to offset that? Am I reading that wrong? I guess just overall in the context of the pressure on margins and the commentary around some of the actions you're taking above -- a bit more perspective."

Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in",538,"Sure. Yes, let me jump into that in a little bit more detail. Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in the quarter. Logistics was probably the most significant headwind we had in the last couple of months versus where we were previously. Obviously, you're not -- you're clearly aware of the logistics industry and whatever -- what's going on, tighter capacity, tighter labor, higher costs. Obviously, which have obviously fueled significant increases in rates internally within North America. Not to mention the fact that there's a lot of congestion going on and a lot of delays in getting product to and from where it needs to be. So as a result, we've been very focused on working with our retailers to ensure that we can continue to improve upon that. The other areas I mentioned earlier, we have this incredibly efficient global supply chain, but we do source product from different parts of the world. And you've seen, obviously, ocean freight increases increased dramatically over the last 3 months or 4 months. 
We have not been immune to that North America, quite frankly, brings quite a bit of its product from overseas, while we have very substantial manufacturing presence in North America. We do bring product from overseas, which has obviously been a victim of those price increases we've seen in ocean freights. The other one is we have seen increased demand, particularly in some of our oral care products, and we want to continue to service that as we always have, consistently and reliably to our trade partners. And as a result of that, we made decisions to airfreight product in to ensure that we had sufficient supply for our retailers. That airfreight did not come without a significant cost.  We will move through that clearly as we move through this year and into next year. 
And so we'll see those costs come out. And as you alluded to in your question, we did take some important strategic decisions on how we look at our network and our supply chain, both from a contractor standpoint as well as what we source internally within our facilities and made some decisions in the quarter that will allow us to rework some of those contracts and hopefully drive more profitability in the long term. 
So overall, we're pleased. Good oral care growth, which is obviously where we want to see that business continue to grow. The business is looking at obviously a pricing environment that's becoming more conducive to take pricing historically, which has not been the case. And they're very focused on their new product grids around premium innovation, which is a strong plan for 2022 and a resurgence of focus around revenue growth management given how important it is that we offset some of that compression we're seeing at the margin line. So overall, a difficult quarter for North America, but they've got the plans in place, and we think some of the things that we were working through in the quarter will be behind us as we move forward into '22."

And I'm just wondering if there's something other than just tough comps, if there's a change in the way consumers shop or how much they have to spend kind of from a high-level big picture perspective?"

Obviously, that was drawn down by some of the shutdowns we saw across Asia and the lack of mobility. Southeast Asia, in fact, very little mobility. We saw categories fall off quite dramatically across Southeast Asia, and that certainly had an impact on volume in the quarter. And as you heard John mentioned, if you really want to dimensionalize a lot of the volume softness in the quarter, it was liquid hand soap, which was a headwind of 400 basis points in the North America business alone. 
But let me step back to your broader question on what's going on around the world coming out of COVID and what we're seeing in terms of category behaviors. Oral Care was not a COVID beneficiary. And obviously, it was not in the same cap as we saw from some of our personal care businesses, which saw a significant acceleration in consumption. And a more systemic behavior change across the world. So oral care, as mobility comes back into the market, we continue to see the oral care categories growing, and that's good for us long term. 
Obviously, getting more and more consumers back in the stores will allow more consumption and more category-driven initiatives to take place. And so we think over the longer term, we're going to see Oral Care continue to accelerate. Personal Care and Home Care were obviously quite significant beneficiaries during COVID, while the liquid hand soap has taken a significant drop off this year, it still remains above the 2019 levels. And as you rightfully said, we're the #1 liquid hand so player, certainly in North America and around the world. And that -- we'll see that behavior, at least stay with the consumer above the 19 levels, but certainly not anywhere close to where they were in 2020. Hygiene products that we're very focused on in our home care business, whether it be dish liquids or floor cleaners, I think we'll continue to see nice growth in those categories. You heard John mentioned the home care growth that we've seen. As more and more consumers stay home, obviously, there's more dishes being cleaned and more floors being cleaned, and that has allowed that category to continue to be quite robust. But as consumers move back and mobility comes back in the markets or people return to work, you may see a little bit softness in those longer term. 
But overall, we think we're positioned well, particularly in the oral care space. If you go to pet food, obviously, the significant adoptions that we've seen over the last 2 years during COVID and the fact that we're now executing much, much better against our strategy, we feel very good about where the -- where things are moving there. And there has been a behavior change unquestionably in that category where consumers have returned to science and nutrition and very focused on that space, which we are obviously very driven by right now."

Question, Noel, I want to come back to the pricing strategy and implications on gross margin over the next 12 months. So specifically, with all the pricing that's going into place, you guys have done a fantastic job of funding the growth for decades. My question is, is the intention, as you sit here today with all the volatility in the environment that you can fully offset the input cost pressure and everything you're dealing with the supply chain perspective with pricing and productivity. Is that a realistic ambition? Is that the realistic goal as you're sitting here from a risk management perspective? Is that something you think you can do? Or is the cost inflation and supply chain pressure is just too great at this point? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about it, how you're pricing and how you're thinking about productivity. 
And then if I could sneak in 1 related question, a lot of interest around demand elasticity, which has been relatively low, I think, across many categories, just to understand is going to vary by category, by geography, by channel. Just some broader observations there, Noel, what you're seeing so far with the pricing in place for your business would be helpful."
262247,1675729136,2417875,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Sure. So Kevin, you obviously watched us closely and price has always been a key driver of our organic growth, given how we look at the markets around the world, and we've consistently looked for quick ways to get pricing in the market, not only to drive",608,"Sure. So Kevin, you obviously watched us closely and price has always been a key driver of our organic growth, given how we look at the markets around the world, and we've consistently looked for quick ways to get pricing in the market, not only to drive category growth, but obviously, to protect the margin, which ultimately allows us to protect the advertising. 
It's worth mentioning that obviously on a 2-year stack that this was the highest pricing number we've seen in many years for us. So again, I think it reflects a consistent discipline we have across the board of taking pricing quickly in the market. You heard me talk a little bit about how we're using data and revenue growth management now to get that information on the ground quickly to the teams so they can do what they need to do to analyze to take pricing across the board. But it's not just going to be pricing. We will look at, obviously, premium innovation and getting our mix improved not only within our portfolios, but channel mix as well. I talked a little bit about the importance of driving pharmacy growth around the world, which is a growth opportunity for the company, particularly in Oral Care. That typically trades at a much better margin for the company, given the therapeutic profile of those bundles. 
We're obviously going to continue to embed significant revenue growth management initiatives all over the world, not just in some of the key inflationary markets. And as we talked about earlier, we're deploying some pretty nice strategies around the emerging markets right now to ensure that we get pricing up beyond just list prices. The other piece of this is productivity. Historically, you've seen us do a really good job around funding the growth. This quarter was no exception, adding 220 basis points to the margin line. But we're really dialing that up, not just simply from a cost standpoint, but really looking at efficiencies across the organization. And going into 2022, looking at how we look to find optimized ways to run our business more efficiently, and we'll continue to do that as we historically have done and find ways to pull cost out of the system. 
John mentioned in his commentary, our overheads were actually down very nicely in the quarter on a percent of sales. And again, I think that's part of the cost focus that we have and looking at our business and making sure that we're finding ways to optimize. So it's going to be a multitude of different things, and we'll continue to see that fall. It will take some time to be sure. These things don't move in a straight line. We're taking pricing where we can as quickly as we can. We're obviously watching the competitiveness of the market. But as I mentioned earlier, this is an environment that everyone is facing right now, which tends to allow everyone to find ways to take pricing up in the category. So we don't feel we will be in an anticompetitive position, but we will be very close to watch that markets to ensure that we continue to remain competitive. 
The other piece of this, we haven't really mentioned is the advertising, and we continue to focus on being building our brands and being competitive in the marketplace, and that is a key driver of the consistent top line growth you're seeing in the company right now, and we'll continue to do everything we can to protect that advertising line and obviously, working through the middle of the P&L will be critical in that regard."

We've dialed up our competitiveness, and we're seeing the benefits of that translate into better share progression, particularly across some of our premium bundles. 
We continue to support the business quite well. We think we're in a good place where we need to be. But obviously, as any market, I would say, more support is always better. We're looking for increased efficiencies in that business as we move forward in order to accelerate gross margin. As I mentioned earlier, North America was disproportionately hit with raw material inflation and logistics, and we took decisions very deliberately in the quarter to address demand that obviously had an effect in that quarter. So we anticipate that will start to come out as we move through the fourth quarter and certainly as we move into the first half of 2022. 
That being said, the raw material environment continues to be very volatile and unpredictable, and we'll take the decisions that we need to take to remain competitive. We are very focused on growing the North America business. It is a priority for the company. We are ensuring that we give them what they need in order to address the challenges and the competitiveness of that marketplace. And we expect that we'll continue to see good gross margin expansion over time. 
I do think this is a low for us. But I say that in the context of an environment that's quite unpredictable. But given what we saw go through in the third quarter, we anticipate that things will get better as we move forward."

Listen, we've historically led pricing in so many of our markets. And in the emerging markets, you tend to see a little bit more elasticity early on, but we are focused on ensuring that our innovation processes across multiple price tiers. And so when you combine pricing with innovation at the same time, we find that we can rebuild consumption quite quickly. So elasticity tends to dissipate over time, certainly, as we get the new innovation in the market and communicate that. So we're quite confident in where we are in emerging markets. 
Developed markets tend to be a little bit more difficult. You know historically, taking pricing in Europe and North America has been a challenge. We have certainly shifted a lot of our focus to now relaunching brands, relaunching the core bringing more premium innovation in the market in order to drive pricing. And typically then as you bring value-added, consumer-oriented benefits to the category, you can take pricing, and therefore, the elasticity isn't as dramatic. So we will see it over time. 
I think that everyone is raising pricing is fundamentally in the categories that we compete in. That tends to reduce elasticity as well. One might ask, where is private label in this environment. Private label shares were down in every single category in which we compete, fundamentally. So the news is big brands are winning. And I think as long as you bring good quality innovation, you continue to support that innovation with good content, and it's personalized and targeted, we think we can offset some of the elasticity. But that being said, the raw material environment is significant and pricing will be significant over the next few quarters in order to offset that moving forward. But we want to do that to make sure we protect our amortizing line."

We're very pleased with the momentum. I mentioned in my comments, up sequentially, our 2-year stack, on volume and pricing in this environment, we think, is a terrific result, driven by our core focus areas, which is Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So Oral Care continues to drive good sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. We talked about it, mid-singles in the quarter, high singles on the year. 
Obviously, the pet nutrition business double digits, comping double digits. So again, I think some terrific progress there. Personal Care significantly impacted by COVID-driven categories. And the liquid hand soap, which is a very big business for us in North America and around the world, obviously, we saw a significant falloff in the category. The category was down 28% to give you some context on that. And as John mentioned, that was a 400 basis point headwind. So some of the COVID categories will certainly stabilize as we move forward and we lap those moving into 2022. But the essence of your question is, where are we with the momentum on oral care. We feel good about it. We feel good about our '22 plans. We feel good about the pricing we're taking. We feel good about the segments we're competing in. We feel good about the channel strategy that we've had, where we're growing share in the fastest growth channels, which are typically e-commerce, discounters and pharmacy and the strategies that were put in place and the portfolio execution of that is delivering against it. 
So we feel, overall, we're pleased with the underlying momentum on oral care, personal care as we lap some of the COVID will improve moving forward. We paid -- had some good discussions, particularly in North America and Europe around some of the innovation that we need to continue to drive it. Our market share interesting though, just as a data point, our market share on liquid hand soap in the U.S. was actually up 2 points in the quarter given the fact that it was still down 400 basis points versus where it was last year on a volume standpoint. 
So again, we think we're taking the right decisions on portfolio and innovation in order to drive share and continue to recover some of the softness that we saw that was temporarily driven by the COVID expansion last year."

But I think important to note, as you mentioned, free cash flow is you'll see the investment we're making in the business in CapEx. So CapEx, up roughly $120 million. 
That's really an investment, as Noel talked about earlier, and the long-term health of our business and what we're looking to grow.

I think the answer is everyone is no one is immune to the inflation that we're seeing across the market, both from a raw material standpoint or from a logistics standpoint. Obviously, they may have different constituents that look at their business differently than public companies or big multinational companies, but in any case, no one is immune to it. 
And I've had discussions and been able to get out and travel a bit and talk to retailers, I mean, retailers are recognizing even on their own private label brands, they're going to have to take pricing to offset the significant inflation that's being absorbed in the market right now. So I expect that you'll see all boats rise, so to speak, in this environment, that pricing will go up. There will be certainly some delay with local players as they tend to try to search out a bit more volume as the big players take pricing. 
But again, I think if you can combine the pricing with the right innovation, which we're very focused on delivering and adding value to the consumer, the local brands have to react to that in some form or fashion, either with their own innovation or with their own price increases in order to stay competitive from a support standpoint. So I don't anticipate at this point it's going to be a significant issue. 
Javier, you know our business really well. You know that we innovate across all price points, and we have significant focus that's very deliberate in markets and looking at shares and our innovation process across each of the key price segments that we compete in and that will certainly be the case as we move forward."

And I think it's very clear that we have reaccelerated the top line of the company. And that has been our core focus for everyone in the organization is this growth mindset that talks about elevating our core, our adjacencies and faster growth channels and doing that across all categories and all geographies. And if you take a basis of 2 years ago, that's exactly what we were delivering against right now. So the investment we believe is fueling that growth. Obviously, the strategies and the execution are a big part of it, but we feel very strongly that the acceleration that we've had in investment, both on the oral care side as well as the pet nutrition side, have clearly delivered top line growth. 
Now we would like to see it be reflected in some of the Nielsen-based share readings, but the market is very complex now. The go-to-market strategies and the path to purchase for consumers is much more complex than it ever was in the past and consumers moving between channels and obviously, the emergence of online, which is quite significant. And in some markets like China has become a very significant part of the category, and we're seeing very share growth there. So overall, we feel the top line is moving in the right direction. The investment is supporting that. 
That being said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver ROI against every dollar in the P&L. And we have brought in resources from the outside and amplified our capacity around the world, working with WPP, our partner, to get much more granular and much more analytical about how we're investing, particularly our digital spend to make sure it's targeted, and we're getting ROI for that spend, and we're getting much, much better at that. So as we look at our advertising, we'll continue to be competitive in terms of what's needed in the marketplace, continue to ensure the health of our brands are protected. But we're very focused from a productivity and efficiency standpoint looking at that bucket of spend and making it work harder for us, and that's exactly what we'll expect to see in 2022 as well."

And that pricing certainly had a little bit of impact on volume shares in the quarter, but nothing that's terribly concerning to us. It's what we consider not real profitable volume, given that we're losing to the lower end of the market. Some of our competitors have been highly aggressive with the promotional levels, and we decided to protect the margin in the P&L and continue to invest in building the brands. 
Interesting, if you look at some of our equity measures in that marketplace, particularly given that we focus now on really supporting the equity as well as innovation, I was -- I attended their budget review just recently and they look terrific. So again, I think we feel like we've got a very strong position in that market. We sacrificed a little bit of the promotional share, but that is not unusual when we take pricing and lead the market, and we'll continue to ramp up innovation and ensure that we remain competitive, but nothing to be concerned of. 
Brazil, likewise, which you didn't ask about, but I'll mention that shares are flat there and doing very, very well, particularly as we see great growth in the pharmacy channel. So the balance of our portfolio has gotten much more therapeutic, which is obviously more profitable for us in the long term. So we're pleased with some of our 2 big markets. And you heard John mention Colombia is back on track given the political disruptions we saw last quarter and driving some nice growth for us. So across Latin America, good, not concerned about Mexico at this point."

Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website,  for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. 
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 in the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. 
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. 
As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue. 
Our focus on innovation, premiumization, pricing and productivity allowed us to deliver solid Q3 and year-to-date results despite a very difficult operating environment. We continue to deliver against our targets because we are executing consistently on the strategy, Noel laid out at CAGNY back in 2019. We are focused on delivering consistent, sustainable, profitable growth, both volume and pricing growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions emerging in developed markets. And this has enabled us to deliver 11 straight quarters with organic sales growth in line with or above our long-term target of 3% to 5%. This is despite very difficult comparisons and a challenging operating environment. 
The current operating environment is challenging in many different ways. Consumer mobility is limited in many markets, particularly in Asia, due to government restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19, which is having a negative impact on category growth. These restrictions have also led to temporary closure of manufacturing facilities across many industries, as you have heard in the news, and from other companies. We are not immune to these restrictions, although given the essential nature of our categories,  we produce products that people and their pets used on a daily basis to lead healthier lives, we have been able to resume production throughout our network, although sometimes at a lower than normal level. This did have a slight impact on sales in the third quarter and we expect a modest impact in the fourth quarter as we ramp production back up. 
We are fortunate to have a flexible and resilient global supply chain that has helped us to offset some of the effects of these supply chain challenges, albeit sometimes with additional logistics costs. Speaking of logistics, the stress on global logistics networks is creating shortages of raw materials, lengthening shipment times, increasing costs and adding additional uncertainty. All of this is on top of the significant increases in raw material costs and continued movement in foreign exchange. These challenges will continue into next year, but we will continue to meet them head on. 
Our net sales grew 6.5% in the quarter, driven by 4.5% organic sales growth and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the third quarter was led by Oral Care, where we were up mid-single digits and Pet Nutrition, where we were up double digits. We delivered organic sales growth in Home Care despite a difficult comparison, which puts our Home Care business at double-digit growth on a 2-year stack. 
As expected, organic sales in Personal Care declined mid-single digits as we lapped the COVID-related growth in liquid hand soap in the year ago period, but sales remain above 2019 levels. We grew volume 1.5% in the quarter. Pricing grew 3% in the quarter, up sequentially from Q2 despite a more difficult 4.5% comparison, as we continue to layer in new pricing to try to offset accelerating raw material costs. Pricing was up in every category and every division. 
Raw materials continued to increase in Q3,  putting further pressure on our gross margins despite additional pricing and productivity efforts. Our gross margin was down 180 basis points in the quarter. Pricing was a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 510 basis point headwind despite a slight benefit from transactional foreign exchange. Productivity was favorable by 220 basis points. On a GAAP and base business basis,  our SG&A was up 50 basis points on a percent of sales driven by significant increase in logistics costs as advertising was up on a dollar basis but flat on a percent of sales basis. 
Excluding logistics and advertising, our overheads were down slightly on a dollar basis and down nicely on a percent of sales basis. We continue to increase our investments in capabilities like digital, e-commerce and data and analytics but this was more than offset by sales leverage and tight expense controls. 
For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was down 5% year-over-year, while it was down 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 7% on a GAAP basis and up 3% on a base business basis. 
A few comments on our divisional performance. Net sales in North America grew 1% in the third quarter with organic sales growth of 0.5% and 50 basis points of favorable foreign exchange. Volumes were flat in the quarter despite a negative nearly 400 basis point impact from lower liquid hand soap volumes, while pricing was slightly favorable. We made significant progress on our North American business in the quarter with solid oral care growth, driven by mid-single-digit growth in toothpaste, which led to improved toothpaste market share performance through the quarter. Personal Care and Home Care were both down as we lapped COVID benefits in the year ago period, although EltaMD and PCA Skin delivered strong growth in the quarter. 
North America operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and higher logistics costs. The impact of plant closures on our global supply chain required us to incur additional air freight charges to fulfill customer orders in the quarter. We also incurred some additional manufacturing costs in the quarter that should help improve the long-term profitability of the division. Latin America net sales were up 11%, with 8% organic sales growth, and a 300 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All 3 categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with oral care organic sales growth in the high single digits. Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 5.5%. Brazil and Mexico led the growth in the quarter, while Colombia delivered double-digit growth following last quarter's political unrest. The Natural segment continues to be a key driver of growth for us across Latin America, particularly Colgate Natural Extracts Charcoal. And we recently launched Colgate Zero toothpaste in Brazil. 
Our strong Latin America pricing growth highlights the success of our revenue growth management program with a combination of list price increases, premium innovation and trade promo adjustments. Europe net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 1%, and foreign exchange adding 2%. Volume was down 1% and pricing was flat. Oral Care organic sales grew high single digits, while Personal Care organic sales were down sharply, driven by difficult liquid hand soap comparisons due to COVID-related consumption in the year ago period and a decline in Filorga duty-free sales. 
Colgate Elixir toothpaste continued to drive growth in the quarter, along with strong contributions from elmex and Meridol. Asia Pacific net sales grew 1% and organic sales declined 0.5% in the quarter, with volume down slightly and pricing in foreign exchange, both slightly positive. Oral Care saw low single-digit organic sales growth in the quarter, while Personal Care and Home Care were down due to difficult COVID comparisons. 
We did see government-imposed mobility restrictions negatively impacting category volumes in several markets, including many in Southeast Asia. India and the Colgate China business both delivered strong volume growth behind robust innovation in the -- segment in India and in e-commerce in China. Our Hawley & Hazel JV saw significantly improved performance in Q3 versus Q2, with trends also improving sequentially through the quarter. Africa/Eurasia net sales grew 1% in the quarter,  with an organic sales decline of 1%, lapping double-digit organic growth in the year ago period, more than offset by a 2% positive impact from foreign exchange. Volumes were minus 4.5%, while pricing was plus 3.5%. The organic sales growth decline in the quarter was driven by Personal Care, as we lapped double-digit growth in the year ago period due to COVID-related demand and pricing. 
Oral Care organic sales in the quarter were flat as disruptions in the global supply chain had a negative impact on product availability. Hill's strong growth continued in the third quarter with 20% net sales growth and 19% organic sales growth, with strong growth in both emerging and developed markets. Organic sales growth was driven by double-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing through list price increases and our premiumization strategies. 
Our focus on the microbiome, which Pat Burton talked about during our CAGNY presentation this year, continues to pay dividends with the Active Biome Plus technology, including in Hill's Prescription Diet gastrointestinal biome and Hill's Science Diet -- Perfect Digestion, both of which are driving sales growth and share in this important segment. 
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As I mentioned previously, we have seen an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID-19, including reduced consumer mobility and supply chain interruptions. We are managing through these issues, but we would expect modest headwinds from this to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in July. Please note that at current spot rates, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on Q4. 
All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. Given the continued pressures from raw materials, we are projecting a greater decline in gross margin than when we last gave guidance in July. Fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be roughly in line with the third quarter, although the raw material situation remains very difficult. 
We continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG were available and many others. We are focused on recouping the gross margin we have lost due to cost inflation over time and are planning to take the actions necessary to do so. Advertising is still expected to be up on a dollar basis but flat on a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 23% for the year on both a GAAP and base business basis. 
On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits. And as we said on the second quarter call, towards the lower end of that range. On a base business basis,  we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."

So what I take away from our performance, I guess both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic and operational journey despite the significant volatility we are encountering across our entire business. 
At the heart of this is our strategy to deliver broad-based sustainable profitable growth, every division, every category, both volume and pricing. That's our aspiration. And over the past few years, we have changed our mindset about how we drive growth. We're more proactive in attacking the opportunities for growth, think core, premium adjacencies, faster alternative channels and markets, and of course, we talked a lot about building capabilities. Think digital, data, e-commerce, innovation. All of these are helping us mine these important areas of growth. While locking our most difficult comparisons in over a decade, we've delivered organic sales growth at the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. And on a 2-year basis, both pricing and volume growth increased sequentially in the quarter. Importantly, this growth is being driven by our 2 most important categories, Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. 
Oral Care organic sales were up mid-single digits in Q3 and against the mid-single-digit comparison and are up high single digits year-to-date. We're driving this growth through more impactful innovation, share growth in faster-growth channels like e-commerce and pharmacies and higher, more efficient marketing spending. Our premiumization strategy is paying off with our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, changing how we interact with the people who use our products. A great example of this is how we've changed our approach to whitening. In the U.S., you're familiar with Optic White Renewal, which has done incredibly well. Outside the U.S., the story needs to be more about just hydrogen peroxide levels. In China, it's about enzyme-based whitening. In other markets, we have whitening products targeted towards consumers who would love tea or coffee or consumers who love wine or tobacco. We're targeting the whitening opportunity much more broadly with new technologies, formulations and delivery systems, expanding our growth potential. 
Pet Nutrition organic sales growth was up 19% in the quarter against an 11% comparison and is now up 14% year-to-date through quarter 3. This growth is driven by Hill's science-based equity messaging behind our core. It's driven by meaningful premium innovation and the continued expertise of our digital and e-commerce teams. The launch of Prescription Diet Derm complete, those breakthrough therapeutic nutrition for both food and environmental sensitivities has led to share gains in the category and is being rolled out internationally over the next few quarters. Hill's goal of ending pet obesity where studies show over 50% of pets who are overweight is the impetus for our Hill's master brand campaign. This campaign has been rolled out globally and has driven growth in both our therapeutic and wellness anti-obesity products. 
In this type of environment, we couldn't deliver the results without -- this year without the amazing work done by Colgate people every day. Our customer development organization is reacting quickly to the changing cost environment so we can take pricing as part of the revenue growth management initiative. Marketing and R&D are working together to accelerate the launch of premium innovation to drive mix and profitability. And most importantly, our global supply chain team has delivered these results despite freight and logistics disruptions, plant closures, congested ports and supplier outages. Importantly, all the efforts we have put into building capabilities over the past few years is not just about driving growth. It's also about creating an organization that can respond more rapidly to all these challenges we face around the world. 
For example, our focus on data and analytics is helping our revenue growth management program pinpoint the best opportunities for incremental pricing as costs continue to rise. We're getting this pricing out in the market more quickly and the data that drives the process gives our people on the ground more confidence in their decisions. 
Our investment in e-commerce and digital marketing continues to pay off. In our 6 largest e-commerce markets for Oral Care,  we finished the third quarter with year-to-date net sales already ahead of '22 net sales -- 2020 net sales, and toothpaste share growth in 5 of the 6 markets. 
We've implemented a new media vine strategy to drive efficiencies, both online and offline and launched a 4-tier training program to enable 14,000 of our employees to help drive our digital strategy. As I've said,  the key to all of this is that we recognize that the strategy is working. And while we address the pressing issues of raw materials, logistics and supply chain, we can't lose sight of our long-term areas of focus. Our innovation calendar for 2022 will show an increase in the percentage of innovation that is breakthrough and transformational. We've announced our new sustainability and social impact strategy this year, which includes 11 new targets and actions in areas like zero waste, climate change, using less plastic as well as Bright Smiles, Bright Futures and our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. And we will continue to build our people and capabilities through new ways of working that are truly changing how Colgate people do their jobs. 
2021 has been a very challenging year for us, and many of these challenges will continue in 2022, but I'm confident of the changes that Colgate people put in place over the past several years, which will allow us to continue to deliver our goal of sustainable, profitable growth. And now I'll open it up for questions."

So overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making on Oral Care, particularly in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. If you take our shares on a constant currency basis, they're relatively flat, which is better than where we had been.  When you start to go around the world, particularly as you look at new channels, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in e-commerce and pharmacy. So let's just bounce around the world a bit. North America still has been a little bit soft, but we've seen the shares bounce back nicely in the last 13 weeks, and where our shares are actually flat now on an all outlet basis, if you take e-commerce and all the untracked channels. Our estimation is our shares are back to flat in the U.S., slightly up, which is good progress, particularly as we've seen the acceleration of some of the premium SKUs that we've launched in the market, particularly whitening over the last 13 weeks. And likewise, our e-commerce shares continue to be good, not as strong as our general market but progressing in North America. 
Europe, the shares have been strong. Our elmex -- our strategy behind elmex and meridol has been very successful in pushing those businesses across all of our core markets. Our shares continue to be up across that region, and we continue to see the shift toward our premium bundles which was, again, part of the strategy change that we outlined back at CAGNY that we were going to focus on underserved channels like pharmacy with some of our premium therapeutic equities, like meridol and elmex. 
Latin America, the shares continue to be very strong, flat in the quarter, slightly down as a result of some of the promotional volume that we've given up in Mexico, which has been quite significant, but Brazil shares continue to be pretty good and trending nicely, particularly behind strong revenue growth management initiatives that have characterized the Brazilian subsidiary for so long, but overall, pretty good. 
Africa, pretty good, good shares in South Africa, better shares in Russia as we move to a premiumization strategy there. So we're pleased with that aspect as well. China has been a terrific performance in the quarter for us, Dara. We've seen our e-commerce shares across both the Hawley & Hazel joint venture as well as the Colgate franchise, be the fastest-growing SKUs in the market. We are the fastest-growing manufacturer in the market. 
Our shares on the Colgate business in China now are up after many years of declines when you combine both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. So overall, very pleased. And again, I think that's a testament to the strategy and the strategic changes we made with our portfolio. Remember that a big focus in China was getting the premiumization part of the portfolio fixed. The growth in e-commerce has all been premium SKUs, which priced at about 300 index to the general market. So again, I think good innovation at that end of the market is helping to drive our business. And you heard in the upfront comments, obviously, e-commerce across the world once again is driving nice shares for us, particularly in oral care, where we've had a lot of focus. 
Coming back to the question around the strategy on Oral Care. Again, the focus was premium, innovation and new channels. And if you take our pharmacy growth across the world in toothpaste, very strong, particularly in key markets where we're really focused, which have been in Africa, Europe and Latin America, particularly Brazil. You see our pharmacy shares continuing to grow, and we've got a good pipeline of innovation coming in 2022 that's going to be specifically tailored towards pharmacy growth. And likewise, e-commerce being the other fast growth channel and obviously just articulated the success we're having there. 
Therapeutic was the other big focus that we had in CAGNY in terms of where we're going to push the oral care business, particularly toothpaste. We've expanded meridol and elmex strategically into core markets where we see big pharmacy classes of trade and where we see the therapeutic segment growing, and our success has been quite notable, particularly in those markets, whether you look at Brazil specifically, whether you look at the Middle East where we've been quite successful as well. So again, I think that strategy seems to be taking hold. 
Naturals has, quite frankly, been a little bit soft, and I think that's coming out of the COVID period where consumers traded to more therapeutic efficacious brand, so to speak. And the natural segment was  softer than we would have expected. So Hello here in North America, shares are stable, but not growing as much as we anticipated. We did indicate that we're rolling that out selectively into some core markets around the world, and that will unfold in the balance of this quarter and into the first quarter of next year. 
So overall, I think the strategies that we outlined are working, certainly, as you've seen from the results there, mid-single digits in the quarter and high single on the year for Oral Care, which has been absolutely terrific and consistent, and that is on top of a marketplace that, quite frankly, is growing considerably below that right now. So again, we think we're driving share globally on when you look at it on an all outlet basis, particularly given the organic growth sequential improvements that we're seeing."

And we're certainly not immune to that. And -- but what we are very good at is pricing. And you've seen that consistently over time and time over the years, whether it's foreign exchange inflation or raw and packing material inflation, we have found ways over time to recover that in our margin line. And that is certainly the focus right now in the business. 
The good news is when you have an inflationary environment that's indexed around raw materials, you tend to have everyone looking to take pricing in the market, and that makes it more conducive certainly from a category standpoint and making sure that as everyone takes pricing, that the volume continues to go along with that. So we're pleased that we've seen pricing in the marketplace. We've been leading that across the board, quite frankly, particularly in the emerging markets where we've taken pricing quite aggressively throughout the first half and very much into the third quarter, and we've laid out pricing for the fourth quarter and into early 2022. So we'll see the margins begin to recover. Now the environment you've heard around raw materials and logistics continues to be extremely volatile. And we anticipate that we'll continue to see some headwinds in that space. 
The team understands that and is putting the strategies into place, in order to recover margins as we move forward. We will also be heightening our focus around revenue growth management, that discipline is going to be really embedded much more so, given the fact that we've now put some analytical processes in place to help the teams, as I outlined, which we think is terrific. It will give the teams a lot more confidence on the pricing that we're taking to ensure that we're working with our trade partners to grow category at the same time as we take pricing to recover costs. So we're pleased with that. 
Likewise, had a lot of discussions over the last couple of months on our grids, our new product grids, relative to premium innovation and making sure that we continue to focus on that area of the business, where, as you know, historically, we have under-indexed, and we've seen good progress against that, particularly as you look at some of the premium businesses that we have around the world, whether it be elmex, meridol or some of the prices we've taken on our therapeutic bundles within the Colgate portfolio. So overall, a tough raw material environment will continue to be very choppy, but we're very focused in terms of taking pricing and ensuring that we push our premium innovation moving forward."

You've come to know Colgate and the fact that we consider our supply chain a competitive advantage for us, and that is the fact that we operate globally with some of the most efficient facilities around the world. And the benefit of that has obviously translated into the strong gross margin progression that we've seen over the years. That being said, when you operate a global supply chain, you're not immune to decisions taken locally that will impact that. And obviously, in Asia, where we have seen governments taking actions to stop the spread of COVID, whether it be that or obviously impacting some of our suppliers and our third-party contractors, we've seen disruption in the supply chain. And as a result of that, we have the contingencies in place to move that production elsewhere, which the team has done just a tremendous job in servicing the sales need of the business. And you've seen that obviously in the acceleration or the continuous good top line growth that we've had, and that's a function of our supply chain, ensuring that we meet the demand of our products and our retailers. And we moved production around the world to do that. That comes with a cost that certainly we incurred in the quarter. 
Some of the disruptions specifically related to what we've referred to in our commentary. We're moving through those very quickly. We have moved behind one that was quite significant, and we're back to where we needed to be in terms of output, and we're back to pretty close on some of the other ones. We expect that to be fully back in capacity by the end of the quarter, this quarter. But that being said, the environment is very unpredictable. And we'll continue to try to anticipate some of these things moving forward as we've done but one can never be for sure when a government decides to come in and shut down a province or an area based on their needs. Likewise, this has a big impact, obviously, on the rest of the supply chain, whether it be raw material sourcing, whether it be our contractors. You heard in John's commentary, we did take some decisions, particularly in North America around some of the contractors that we use in order to clean that up and move into a supply chain strategy that allows us to exit some of those and get more efficiencies moving forward. So we're taking all the right decisions, moving through the issues that we had in the third quarter, but we're not immune to the unpredictability of the supply chain environment that everyone is faced with today."

Listen, the pet business has been terrific, obviously. I think a lot of the change in strategies that we deployed a couple of years ago, which again, are based foundationally on exactly all the stuff we're trying to deploy across the world, really working on the core of our business, looking at premium innovation and continuing to really dial up our focus on high-growth channels. And that's exactly what's unfolded over the last couple of years, and that strategy is continuing, obviously, to get sharper and sharper as we execute it more broadly across the Hill's network around the world. 
A lot of that growth has come out of North America, which has been terrific. I mean, the double-digit growth compounding each other. The U.S. had another outstanding quarter in the third quarter. Again, we're benefiting from a quite buoyant category, but the important part that you called out is we're growing share quite consistently not only across our wellness products or our core products but also our therapeutic products and prescription diet. We're seeing, obviously, veterinarians open back up. That is certainly improving the consumption of our prescription diet. We talked at length about the innovation process we had behind Hill's, which I think is second to none in the category right now bringing real science and real therapeutic benefits to pet owners, and we're seeing that translate into obviously more penetration and growing share. 
We continue to talk about the low awareness of Hill's, both in North America and around the world. That affords us a significant opportunity as we continue to build that brand consistently all over the world, and we're continuing to invest behind that business. Despite the fact that raw materials are a headwind, we're not going to jeopardize the health of the brand by cutting back on our investment. We will continue to invest to grow awareness and that ultimately is growing penetration in the category. So we feel very good about where we are. 
Obviously, the comparisons continue to get tough. But those have been tough continue to see good progress on the strategy, our ability to take pricing and our ability to bring in new consumers to the franchise."

Do you think like a lack of scale or efficiency or something else in the manufacturing base has been a cause of the margin compression in that business. And do you have opportunities to offset that?

Yes, let me jump into that in a little bit more detail. Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in the quarter. Logistics was probably the most significant headwind we had in the last couple of months versus where we were previously. Obviously, you're not -- you're clearly aware of the logistics industry and whatever -- what's going on, tighter capacity, tighter labor, higher costs. Obviously, which have obviously fueled significant increases in rates internally within North America. Not to mention the fact that there's a lot of congestion going on and a lot of delays in getting product to and from where it needs to be. So as a result, we've been very focused on working with our retailers to ensure that we can continue to improve upon that. The other areas I mentioned earlier, we have this incredibly efficient global supply chain, but we do source product from different parts of the world. And you've seen, obviously, ocean freight increases increased dramatically over the last 3 months or 4 months. 
We have not been immune to that North America, quite frankly, brings quite a bit of its product from overseas, while we have very substantial manufacturing presence in North America. We do bring product from overseas, which has obviously been a victim of those price increases we've seen in ocean freights. The other one is we have seen increased demand, particularly in some of our oral care products, and we want to continue to service that as we always have, consistently and reliably to our trade partners. And as a result of that, we made decisions to airfreight product in to ensure that we had sufficient supply for our retailers. That airfreight did not come without a significant cost.  We will move through that clearly as we move through this year and into next year. 
And so we'll see those costs come out. And as you alluded to in your question, we did take some important strategic decisions on how we look at our network and our supply chain, both from a contractor standpoint as well as what we source internally within our facilities and made some decisions in the quarter that will allow us to rework some of those contracts and hopefully drive more profitability in the long term. 
So overall, we're pleased. Good oral care growth, which is obviously where we want to see that business continue to grow. The business is looking at obviously a pricing environment that's becoming more conducive to take pricing historically, which has not been the case. And they're very focused on their new product grids around premium innovation, which is a strong plan for 2022 and a resurgence of focus around revenue growth management given how important it is that we offset some of that compression we're seeing at the margin line. So overall, a difficult quarter for North America, but they've got the plans in place, and we think some of the things that we were working through in the quarter will be behind us as we move forward into '22."

Obviously, that was drawn down by some of the shutdowns we saw across Asia and the lack of mobility. Southeast Asia, in fact, very little mobility. We saw categories fall off quite dramatically across Southeast Asia, and that certainly had an impact on volume in the quarter. And as you heard John mentioned, if you really want to dimensionalize a lot of the volume softness in the quarter, it was liquid hand soap, which was a headwind of 400 basis points in the North America business alone. 
But let me step back to your broader question on what's going on around the world coming out of COVID and what we're seeing in terms of category behaviors. Oral Care was not a COVID beneficiary. And obviously, it was not in the same cap as we saw from some of our personal care businesses, which saw a significant acceleration in consumption. And a more systemic behavior change across the world. So oral care, as mobility comes back into the market, we continue to see the oral care categories growing, and that's good for us long term. 
Obviously, getting more and more consumers back in the stores will allow more consumption and more category-driven initiatives to take place. And so we think over the longer term, we're going to see Oral Care continue to accelerate. Personal Care and Home Care were obviously quite significant beneficiaries during COVID, while the liquid hand soap has taken a significant drop off this year, it still remains above the 2019 levels. And as you rightfully said, we're the #1 liquid hand so player, certainly in North America and around the world. And that -- we'll see that behavior, at least stay with the consumer above the 19 levels, but certainly not anywhere close to where they were in 2020. Hygiene products that we're very focused on in our home care business, whether it be dish liquids or floor cleaners, I think we'll continue to see nice growth in those categories. You heard John mentioned the home care growth that we've seen. As more and more consumers stay home, obviously, there's more dishes being cleaned and more floors being cleaned, and that has allowed that category to continue to be quite robust. But as consumers move back and mobility comes back in the markets or people return to work, you may see a little bit softness in those longer term. 
But overall, we think we're positioned well, particularly in the oral care space. If you go to pet food, obviously, the significant adoptions that we've seen over the last 2 years during COVID and the fact that we're now executing much, much better against our strategy, we feel very good about where the -- where things are moving there. And there has been a behavior change unquestionably in that category where consumers have returned to science and nutrition and very focused on that space, which we are obviously very driven by right now."

Question, Noel, I want to come back to the pricing strategy and implications on gross margin over the next 12 months. So specifically, with all the pricing that's going into place, you guys have done a fantastic job of funding the growth for decades. My question is, is the intention, as you sit here today with all the volatility in the environment that you can fully offset the input cost pressure and everything you're dealing with the supply chain perspective with pricing and productivity. Is that a realistic ambition? Is that the realistic goal as you're sitting here from a risk management perspective? Is that something you think you can do? Or is the cost inflation and supply chain pressure is just too great at this point? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about it, how you're pricing and how you're thinking about productivity. 
And then if I could sneak in 1 related question, a lot of interest around demand elasticity, which has been relatively low, I think, across many categories, just to understand is going to vary by category, by geography, by channel. Just some broader observations there, Noel, what you're seeing so far with the pricing in place for your business would be helpful."

So Kevin, you obviously watched us closely and price has always been a key driver of our organic growth, given how we look at the markets around the world, and we've consistently looked for quick ways to get pricing in the market, not only to drive category growth, but obviously, to protect the margin, which ultimately allows us to protect the advertising. 
It's worth mentioning that obviously on a 2-year stack that this was the highest pricing number we've seen in many years for us. So again, I think it reflects a consistent discipline we have across the board of taking pricing quickly in the market. You heard me talk a little bit about how we're using data and revenue growth management now to get that information on the ground quickly to the teams so they can do what they need to do to analyze to take pricing across the board. But it's not just going to be pricing. We will look at, obviously, premium innovation and getting our mix improved not only within our portfolios, but channel mix as well. I talked a little bit about the importance of driving pharmacy growth around the world, which is a growth opportunity for the company, particularly in Oral Care. That typically trades at a much better margin for the company, given the therapeutic profile of those bundles. 
We're obviously going to continue to embed significant revenue growth management initiatives all over the world, not just in some of the key inflationary markets. And as we talked about earlier, we're deploying some pretty nice strategies around the emerging markets right now to ensure that we get pricing up beyond just list prices. The other piece of this is productivity. Historically, you've seen us do a really good job around funding the growth. This quarter was no exception, adding 220 basis points to the margin line. But we're really dialing that up, not just simply from a cost standpoint, but really looking at efficiencies across the organization. And going into 2022, looking at how we look to find optimized ways to run our business more efficiently, and we'll continue to do that as we historically have done and find ways to pull cost out of the system. 
John mentioned in his commentary, our overheads were actually down very nicely in the quarter on a percent of sales. And again, I think that's part of the cost focus that we have and looking at our business and making sure that we're finding ways to optimize. So it's going to be a multitude of different things, and we'll continue to see that fall. It will take some time to be sure. These things don't move in a straight line. We're taking pricing where we can as quickly as we can. We're obviously watching the competitiveness of the market. But as I mentioned earlier, this is an environment that everyone is facing right now, which tends to allow everyone to find ways to take pricing up in the category. So we don't feel we will be in an anticompetitive position, but we will be very close to watch that markets to ensure that we continue to remain competitive. 
The other piece of this, we haven't really mentioned is the advertising, and we continue to focus on being building our brands and being competitive in the marketplace, and that is a key driver of the consistent top line growth you're seeing in the company right now, and we'll continue to do everything we can to protect that advertising line and obviously, working through the middle of the P&L will be critical in that regard."

And I think you're also on track to actually have market shares lower than you were 5 years ago over that duration. 
So Noel, can you just give us some context around what's happening with the investment plans in North America? What's happening with the strategy there? And do you think you've got the right investment posture, the right innovation plans to compete effectively in the market? Is this a low point on margins? Can we bounce back from here? Is this like an enduring point? Just any context you can give us around the profitability and the performance in that market?"

Obviously, a big focus for us in the North America business. That was strong again in the quarter, up mid-single digits. I won't repeat what I talked about in terms of share growth, particularly in the last 13 weeks. We are more competitive in the U.S. market. We were not competitive in the first half. We've dialed up our competitiveness, and we're seeing the benefits of that translate into better share progression, particularly across some of our premium bundles. 
We continue to support the business quite well. We think we're in a good place where we need to be. But obviously, as any market, I would say, more support is always better. We're looking for increased efficiencies in that business as we move forward in order to accelerate gross margin. As I mentioned earlier, North America was disproportionately hit with raw material inflation and logistics, and we took decisions very deliberately in the quarter to address demand that obviously had an effect in that quarter. So we anticipate that will start to come out as we move through the fourth quarter and certainly as we move into the first half of 2022. 
That being said, the raw material environment continues to be very volatile and unpredictable, and we'll take the decisions that we need to take to remain competitive. We are very focused on growing the North America business. It is a priority for the company. We are ensuring that we give them what they need in order to address the challenges and the competitiveness of that marketplace. And we expect that we'll continue to see good gross margin expansion over time. 
I do think this is a low for us. But I say that in the context of an environment that's quite unpredictable. But given what we saw go through in the third quarter, we anticipate that things will get better as we move forward."

Listen, we've historically led pricing in so many of our markets. And in the emerging markets, you tend to see a little bit more elasticity early on, but we are focused on ensuring that our innovation processes across multiple price tiers. And so when you combine pricing with innovation at the same time, we find that we can rebuild consumption quite quickly. So elasticity tends to dissipate over time, certainly, as we get the new innovation in the market and communicate that. So we're quite confident in where we are in emerging markets. 
Developed markets tend to be a little bit more difficult. You know historically, taking pricing in Europe and North America has been a challenge. We have certainly shifted a lot of our focus to now relaunching brands, relaunching the core bringing more premium innovation in the market in order to drive pricing. And typically then as you bring value-added, consumer-oriented benefits to the category, you can take pricing, and therefore, the elasticity isn't as dramatic. So we will see it over time. 
I think that everyone is raising pricing is fundamentally in the categories that we compete in. That tends to reduce elasticity as well. One might ask, where is private label in this environment. Private label shares were down in every single category in which we compete, fundamentally. So the news is big brands are winning. And I think as long as you bring good quality innovation, you continue to support that innovation with good content, and it's personalized and targeted, we think we can offset some of the elasticity. But that being said, the raw material environment is significant and pricing will be significant over the next few quarters in order to offset that moving forward. But we want to do that to make sure we protect our amortizing line."

I guess I'm trying to get a better sense for how you're seeing Colgate's momentum trending, particularly on the oral, home and personal care businesses. 
As I look at it, I think I see directional improvements. They're evident this quarter sequentially. But at the same time, in most regions, I think overall performance came in lighter than many of us had hoped on the outside. So again, can you maybe just summarize the sequential momentum as you see it on a global basis, maybe how you expect things to progress in fourth quarter ex Hills and what the early setup is heading into the new fiscal year in terms of building that momentum further?"

We're very pleased with the momentum. I mentioned in my comments, up sequentially, our 2-year stack, on volume and pricing in this environment, we think, is a terrific result, driven by our core focus areas, which is Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So Oral Care continues to drive good sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. We talked about it, mid-singles in the quarter, high singles on the year. 
Obviously, the pet nutrition business double digits, comping double digits. So again, I think some terrific progress there. Personal Care significantly impacted by COVID-driven categories. And the liquid hand soap, which is a very big business for us in North America and around the world, obviously, we saw a significant falloff in the category. The category was down 28% to give you some context on that. And as John mentioned, that was a 400 basis point headwind. So some of the COVID categories will certainly stabilize as we move forward and we lap those moving into 2022. But the essence of your question is, where are we with the momentum on oral care. We feel good about it. We feel good about our '22 plans. We feel good about the pricing we're taking. We feel good about the segments we're competing in. We feel good about the channel strategy that we've had, where we're growing share in the fastest growth channels, which are typically e-commerce, discounters and pharmacy and the strategies that were put in place and the portfolio execution of that is delivering against it. 
So we feel, overall, we're pleased with the underlying momentum on oral care, personal care as we lap some of the COVID will improve moving forward. We paid -- had some good discussions, particularly in North America and Europe around some of the innovation that we need to continue to drive it. Our market share interesting though, just as a data point, our market share on liquid hand soap in the U.S. was actually up 2 points in the quarter given the fact that it was still down 400 basis points versus where it was last year on a volume standpoint. 
So again, we think we're taking the right decisions on portfolio and innovation in order to drive share and continue to recover some of the softness that we saw that was temporarily driven by the COVID expansion last year."

Yes, thanks. So look, we continue to cycle favorable working capital performance versus last year, and there's really an anomaly when you look at 2020. First of all, 2020 cash flow driven by the unique environment was up significantly. While we're down year-to-year, I think if you look back and compare to '18 and '19, you'll see that it's more in line. Higher raw materials pricing certainly put upward pressure on our inventories. But I think important to note, as you mentioned, free cash flow is you'll see the investment we're making in the business in CapEx. So CapEx, up roughly $120 million. 
That's really an investment, as Noel talked about earlier, and the long-term health of our business and what we're looking to grow. So that investment has an impact on free cash flow, but we think is incredibly important for the long term. So if you step back and look at cash flow where we are today, we're not concerned about the positioning.  We think we're confident in our ability to generate that cash.

I think the answer is everyone is no one is immune to the inflation that we're seeing across the market, both from a raw material standpoint or from a logistics standpoint. Obviously, they may have different constituents that look at their business differently than public companies or big multinational companies, but in any case, no one is immune to it. 
And I've had discussions and been able to get out and travel a bit and talk to retailers, I mean, retailers are recognizing even on their own private label brands, they're going to have to take pricing to offset the significant inflation that's being absorbed in the market right now. So I expect that you'll see all boats rise, so to speak, in this environment, that pricing will go up. There will be certainly some delay with local players as they tend to try to search out a bit more volume as the big players take pricing. 
But again, I think if you can combine the pricing with the right innovation, which we're very focused on delivering and adding value to the consumer, the local brands have to react to that in some form or fashion, either with their own innovation or with their own price increases in order to stay competitive from a support standpoint. So I don't anticipate at this point it's going to be a significant issue. 
Javier, you know our business really well.

And that has been our core focus for everyone in the organization is this growth mindset that talks about elevating our core, our adjacencies and faster growth channels and doing that across all categories and all geographies. And if you take a basis of 2 years ago, that's exactly what we were delivering against right now. So the investment we believe is fueling that growth. Obviously, the strategies and the execution are a big part of it, but we feel very strongly that the acceleration that we've had in investment, both on the oral care side as well as the pet nutrition side, have clearly delivered top line growth. 
Now we would like to see it be reflected in some of the Nielsen-based share readings, but the market is very complex now. The go-to-market strategies and the path to purchase for consumers is much more complex than it ever was in the past and consumers moving between channels and obviously, the emergence of online, which is quite significant. And in some markets like China has become a very significant part of the category, and we're seeing very share growth there. So overall, we feel the top line is moving in the right direction. The investment is supporting that. 
That being said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver ROI against every dollar in the P&L. And we have brought in resources from the outside and amplified our capacity around the world, working with WPP, our partner, to get much more granular and much more analytical about how we're investing, particularly our digital spend to make sure it's targeted, and we're getting ROI for that spend, and we're getting much, much better at that.

And that pricing certainly had a little bit of impact on volume shares in the quarter, but nothing that's terribly concerning to us. It's what we consider not real profitable volume, given that we're losing to the lower end of the market. Some of our competitors have been highly aggressive with the promotional levels, and we decided to protect the margin in the P&L and continue to invest in building the brands. 
Interesting, if you look at some of our equity measures in that marketplace, particularly given that we focus now on really supporting the equity as well as innovation, I was -- I attended their budget review just recently and they look terrific. So again, I think we feel like we've got a very strong position in that market. We sacrificed a little bit of the promotional share, but that is not unusual when we take pricing and lead the market, and we'll continue to ramp up innovation and ensure that we remain competitive, but nothing to be concerned of. 
Brazil, likewise, which you didn't ask about, but I'll mention that shares are flat there and doing very, very well, particularly as we see great growth in the pharmacy channel.

Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. 
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.  
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 in the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website.  
Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
Our focus on innovation, premiumization, pricing and productivity allowed us to deliver solid Q3 and year-to-date results despite a very difficult operating environment. We continue to deliver against our targets because we are executing consistently on the strategy Noel laid out at CAGNY back in 2019. 
We are focused on delivering consistent, sustainable and profitable growth, both volume and pricing growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions, emerging and developed markets. And this has enabled us to deliver 11 straight quarters with organic sales growth in line with or above our long-term target of 3% to 5%. This is despite very difficult comparisons and a challenging operating environment.  
The current operating environment is challenging in many different ways. Consumer mobility is limited in many markets, particularly in Asia, due to government restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19, which is having a negative impact on category growth. These restrictions have also led to temporary closure of manufacturing facilities across many industries, as you have heard in the news and from other companies. 
We are not immune to these restrictions. Although, given the essential nature of our categories, we produce products that people and their pets use on a daily basis to lead healthier lives, we have been able to resume production throughout our network, although, sometimes, at a lower-than-normal level. This did have a slight impact on sales in the third quarter, and we expect a modest impact in the fourth quarter as we ramp production back up.  
We are fortunate to have a flexible and resilient global supply chain that has helped us to offset some of the effects of these supply chain challenges, albeit sometimes with additional logistics costs. Speaking of logistics, the stress on global logistics networks is creating shortages of raw materials, lengthening shipment times, increasing costs and adding additional uncertainty. All of this is on top of the significant increases in raw material costs and continued movement in foreign exchange. These challenges will continue into next year, but we will continue to meet them head on.  
Our net sales grew 6.5% in the quarter, driven by 4.5% organic sales growth and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the third quarter was led by Oral Care, where we were up mid-single digits; and Pet Nutrition, where we were up double digits. We delivered organic sales growth in Home Care despite a difficult comparison, which puts our Home Care business at double-digit growth on a 2-year stack.  
As expected, organic sales in Personal Care declined mid-single digits as we lap the COVID-related growth in liquid hand soap in the year ago period, but sales remain above 2019 levels. We grew volume 1.5% in the quarter. Pricing grew 3% in the quarter, up sequentially from Q2 despite a more difficult 4.5% comparison as we continue to layer in new pricing to try to offset accelerating raw material costs. Pricing was up in every category and every division.  
Raw materials continued to increase in Q3,  putting further pressure on our gross margins despite additional pricing and productivity efforts. Our gross margin was down 180 basis points in the quarter. Pricing was a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 510 basis point headwind despite a slight benefit from transactional foreign exchange. Productivity was favorable by 220 basis points. 
On a GAAP and base business basis, our SG&A was up 50 basis points on a percent of sales, driven by significant increase in logistics costs, as advertising was up on a dollar basis but flat on a percent of sales basis. Excluding logistics and advertising, our overheads were down slightly on a dollar basis and down nicely on a percent of sales basis. 
We continue to increase our investments in capabilities like digital, e-commerce and data and analytics, but this was more than offset by sales leverage and tight expense controls. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was down 5% year-over-year, while it was down 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 7% on a GAAP basis and up 3% on a base business basis.  
A few comments on our divisional performance. Net sales in North America grew 1% in the third quarter, with organic sales growth of 0.5% and 50 basis points of favorable foreign exchange. Volumes were flat in the quarter despite a negative nearly 400 basis point impact from lower liquid hand soap volumes, while pricing was slightly favorable. 
We made significant progress on our North American business in the quarter with solid Oral Care growth, driven by mid-single-digit growth in toothpaste, which led to improved toothpaste market share performance through the quarter. Personal Care and Home Care were both down as we lapped COVID benefits in the year ago period, although EltaMD and PCA Skin delivered strong growth in the quarter.  
North America operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and higher logistics costs. The impact of plant closures on our global supply chain required us to incur additional air freight charges to fulfill customer orders in the quarter. We also incurred some additional manufacturing costs in the quarter that should help improve the long-term profitability of the division. 
Latin America net sales were up 11%, with 8% organic sales growth and a 300 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All 3 categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high single digits. Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 5.5%. 
Brazil and Mexico led the growth in the quarter, while Colombia delivered double-digit growth following last quarter's political unrest. The Natural segment continues to be a key driver of growth for us across Latin America, particularly Colgate Natural Extracts Charcoal. And we recently launched Colgate Zero toothpaste in Brazil. Our strong Latin America pricing growth highlights the success of our revenue growth management program, with a combination of list price increases, premium innovation and trade promo adjustments. 
Europe net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 1% and foreign exchange adding 2%. Volume was down 1% and pricing was flat. Oral Care organic sales grew high single digits, while Personal Care organic sales were down sharply, driven by difficult liquid hand soap comparisons due to COVID-related consumption in the year ago period and a decline in Filorga duty-free sales.  
Colgate Elixir toothpaste continued to drive growth in the quarter, along with strong contributions from elmex and meridol. 
Asia Pacific net sales grew 1% and organic sales declined 0.5% in the quarter, with volume down slightly and pricing and foreign exchange both slightly positive. Oral Care saw low single-digit organic sales growth in the quarter, while Personal Care and Home Care were down due to difficult COVID comparisons.  
We did see government-imposed mobility restrictions negatively impacting category volumes in several markets, including many in Southeast Asia. India and the Colgate China business both delivered strong volume growth behind robust innovation in the ayurvedic segment in India and in e-commerce in China. Our Hawley & Hazel JV saw a significantly improved performance in Q3 versus Q2, with trends also improving sequentially through the quarter. 
Africa/Eurasia net sales grew 1% in the quarter,  with an organic sales decline of 1% lapping double-digit organic growth in the year ago period, more than offset by a 2% positive impact from foreign exchange. Volumes were minus 4.5%, while pricing was plus 3.5%. The organic sales growth decline in the quarter was driven by Personal Care, as we lap double-digit growth in the year ago period due to COVID-related demand and pricing. Oral Care organic sales in the quarter were flat as disruptions in the global supply chain had a negative impact on product availability. 
Hill's strong growth continued in the third quarter, with 20% net sales growth and 19% organic sales growth, with strong growth in both emerging and developed markets. Organic sales growth was driven by double-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing through list price increases and our premiumization strategies. Our focus on the microbiome, which Pat Burton talked about during our CAGNY presentation this year, continues to pay dividends with the ActivBiome+ Technology, including in Hill's Prescription Diet Gastrointestinal Biome and Hill's Science Diet Perfect Digestion, both of which are driving sales growth and share in this important segment.  
And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As I mentioned previously, we have seen an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID-19, including reduced consumer mobility and supply chain interruptions. We are managing through these issues, but we would expect modest headwinds from this to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in July. Please note that at current spot rates, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on Q4. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. 
Given the continued pressures from raw materials, we are projecting a greater decline in gross margin than when we last gave guidance in July. Fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be roughly in line with the third quarter, although the raw material situation remains very difficult. We continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds, including additional pricing; optimizing trade spending; accelerating FTG, where available; and many others. 
We are focused on recouping the gross margin we have lost due to cost inflation over time and are planning to take the actions necessary to do so. Advertising is still expected to be up on a dollar basis but flat on a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. 
Our tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 23% for the year on both a GAAP and base business basis. On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single digits, and as we said on the second quarter call, towards the lower end of that range. On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid- to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel."
262247,1675729136,2418082,"Colgate-Palmolive Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2021",2021-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So what I take away from our performance, I guess, both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic and operational journey despite the signif",941,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So what I take away from our performance, I guess, both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic and operational journey despite the significant volatility we are encountering across our entire business.  
At the heart of this is our strategy to deliver broad-based sustainable profitable growth, every division, every category, both volume and pricing. That's our aspiration. And over the past few years, we have changed our mindset about how we drive growth. We're more proactive in attacking the opportunities for growth, think core, premium adjacencies, faster alternative channels and markets. And of course, we talked a lot about building capabilities, think digital, data, e-commerce, innovation. All of these are helping us mine these important areas of growth. 
While locked in our most difficult comparisons in over a decade, we've delivered organic sales growth at the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. And on a 2-year basis, both pricing and volume growth increased sequentially in the quarter. Importantly, this growth is being driven by our 2 most important categories: Oral Care and Pet Nutrition.  
Oral Care organic sales were up mid-single digits in Q3 against the mid-single-digit comparison and are up high single digits year-to-date. We're driving this growth through more impactful innovation; share growth in faster-growth channels, like e-commerce and pharmacies; and higher, more efficient marketing spending. Our premiumization strategy is paying off with our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, changing how we interact with the people who use our products. 
A great example of this is how we've changed our approach to whitening. In the U.S., you're familiar with Optic White Renewal, which has done incredibly well. Outside the U.S., the story needs to be more about just hydrogen peroxide levels. In China, it's about enzyme-based whitening. In other markets, we have whitening products targeted towards consumers who would love tea or coffee or consumers who love wine or tobacco. We're targeting the whitening opportunity much more broadly with new technologies, formulations and delivery systems, expanding our growth potential.  
Pet Nutrition organic sales growth was up 19% in the quarter against an 11% comparison and is now up 14% year-to-date through quarter 3. This growth is driven by Hill's science-based equity messaging behind our core. It's driven by meaningful premium innovation and the continued expertise of our digital and e-commerce teams. 
The launch of Prescription Diet Derm Complete, those breakthrough therapeutic nutrition for both food and environmental sensitivities, has led to share gains in the category and is being rolled out internationally over the next few quarters. Hill's goal of ending pet obesity, where studies show over 50% of pets are overweight, is the impetus for our Hill's master brand campaign. This campaign has been rolled out globally and has driven growth in both our therapeutic and wellness anti-obesity products.  
In this type of environment, we couldn't deliver the results without -- this year without the amazing work done by Colgate people every day. Our customer development organization is reacting quickly to the changing cost environment so we can take pricing as part of the revenue growth management initiative. Marketing and R&D are working together to accelerate the launch of premium innovation to drive mix and profitability. 
And most importantly, our global supply chain team has delivered these results despite freight and logistics disruptions, plant closures, congested ports and supplier outages. Importantly, all the efforts we have put into building capabilities over the past few years is not just about driving growth. It's also about creating an organization that can respond more rapidly to all these challenges we face around the world.  
For example, our focus on data and analytics is helping our revenue growth management program pinpoint the best opportunities for incremental pricing as costs continue to rise. We're getting this pricing out in the market more quickly, and the data that drives the process gives our people on the ground more confidence in their decisions.  
Our investment in e-commerce and digital marketing continues to pay off. In our 6 largest e-commerce markets for Oral Care, we finished the third quarter with year-to-date net sales already ahead of '22 net sales -- 2020 net sales, and toothpaste share growth in 5 of the 6 markets. We've implemented a new media buying strategy to drive efficiencies, both online and offline, and launched a 4-tier training program to enable 14,000 of our employees to help drive our digital strategy. 
As I've said, the key to all of this is that we recognize that the strategy is working. And while we address the pressing issues of raw materials, logistics and supply chain, we can't lose sight of our long-term areas of focus. Our innovation calendar for 2022 will show an increase in the percentage of innovation that is breakthrough and transformational. 
We've announced our new sustainability and social impact strategy this year, which includes 11 new targets and actions in areas like zero waste, climate change, using less plastic, as well as Bright Smiles, Bright Futures and our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. And we will continue to build our people and capabilities through new ways of working that are truly changing how Colgate people do their jobs.  
2021 has been a very challenging year for us, and many of these challenges will continue in 2022. But I'm confident of the changes that Colgate people put in place over the past several years, which will allow us to continue to deliver our goal of sustainable, profitable growth. And now I'll open it up for questions."

So overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making on Oral Care, particularly in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. If you take our shares on a constant currency basis, they're relatively flat, which is better than where we had been. When you start to go around the world, particularly as you look at new channels, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in e-commerce and pharmacy. So let's just bounce around the world a bit. 
North America still has been a little bit soft, but we've seen the shares bounce back nicely in the last 13 weeks, and where our shares are actually flat now on an all-outlet basis. If you take e-commerce and all the untracked channels, our estimation is our shares are back to flat in the U.S., slightly up, which is good progress, particularly as we've seen the acceleration of some of the premium SKUs that we've launched in the market, particularly whitening over the last 13 weeks. And likewise, our e-commerce shares continue to be good, not as strong as our general market, but progressing in North America.  
Europe, the shares have been strong. Our elmex and -- our strategy behind elmex and meridol has been very successful in pushing those businesses across all of our core markets. Our shares continue to be up across that region, and we continue to see the shift toward our premium bundles, which was, again, part of the strategy change that we outlined back at CAGNY that we were going to focus on underserved channels, like pharmacy, with some of our premium therapeutic equities like meridol and elmex.  
Latin America, the shares continue to be very strong, flat in the quarter, slightly down as a result of some of the promotional volume that we've given up in Mexico, which has been quite significant. But Brazil shares continue to be pretty good and trending nicely, particularly behind strong revenue growth management initiatives that have characterized the Brazilian subsidiary for so long. But overall, pretty good.  
Africa, pretty good. Good shares in South Africa. Better shares in Russia as we move to a premiumization strategy there, so we're pleased with that aspect as well. 
China has been a terrific performance in the quarter for us, Dara. We've seen our e-commerce shares across both the Hawley & Hazel joint venture as well as the Colgate franchise be the fastest-growing SKUs in the market. We are the fastest-growing manufacturer in the market. Our shares on the Colgate business in China now are up after many years of declines when you combine both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. So overall, very pleased. 
And again, I think that's a testament to the strategy and the strategic changes we made with our portfolio. Remember that a big focus in China was getting the premiumization part of the portfolio fixed. The growth in e-commerce has all been premium SKUs, which priced at about 300 index to the general market. So again, I think good innovation at that end of the market is helping to drive our business. 
And you heard in the upfront comments, obviously, e-commerce across the world, once again, is driving nice shares for us, particularly in Oral Care, where we've had a lot of focus. Coming back to the question around the strategy on Oral Care, again, the focus was premium, innovation and new channels. 
And if you take our pharmacy growth across the world in toothpaste, very strong, particularly in key markets where we're really focused, which have been in Africa, Europe and Latin America, particularly Brazil. You see our pharmacy shares continuing to grow, and we've got a good pipeline of innovation coming in 2022 that's going to be specifically tailored towards pharmacy growth. And likewise, e-commerce being the other fast-growth channel, and obviously just articulated the success we're having there.  
Therapeutic was the other big focus that we had in CAGNY in terms of where we're going to push the Oral Care business, particularly toothpaste. We've expanded meridol and elmex strategically into core markets, where we see big pharmacy classes of trade and where we see the therapeutic segment growing. And our success has been quite notable, particularly in those markets, whether you look at Brazil specifically, whether you look at the Middle East where we've been quite successful as well. So again, I think that strategy seems to be taking hold.  
Naturals has, quite frankly, been a little bit soft, and I think that's coming out of the COVID period where consumers traded to more therapeutic-efficacious brand, so to speak. And the Naturals segment was softer than we would have expected. So Hello here in North America, shares are stable, but not growing as much as we anticipated. We did indicate that we're rolling that out selectively into some core markets around the world, and that will unfold in the balance of this quarter and into the first quarter of next year.  
So overall, I think the strategies that we outlined are working. Certainly, as you've seen from the results there, mid-single digits in the quarter and high single on the year for Oral Care, which has been absolutely terrific and consistent. And that is on top of a marketplace that, quite frankly, is growing considerably below that right now. So again, we think we're driving share globally on -- when you look at it on an all-outlet basis, particularly given the organic growth sequential improvements that we're seeing."

I think throughout the earnings season, so far, that obviously cost inflation is significant for all the fast-moving consumer goods, and we're certainly not immune to that. And -- but what we are very good at is pricing. And you've seen that consistently over -- time and time over the years. Whether it's foreign exchange inflation or raw and packing material inflation, we have found ways over time to recover that in our margin line. And that is certainly the focus right now in the business.  
The good news is when you have an inflationary environment that's indexed around raw materials, you tend to have everyone looking to take pricing in the market. And that makes it more conducive, certainly, from a category standpoint and making sure that as everyone takes pricing, that the volume continues to go along with that. So we're pleased that we've seen pricing in the marketplace. 
We've been leading that across the board, quite frankly, particularly in the emerging markets where we've taken pricing quite aggressively throughout the first half and very much into the third quarter, and we've laid out pricing for the fourth quarter and into early 2022. So we'll see the margins begin to recover. Now the environment you've heard around raw materials and logistics continues to be extremely volatile, and we anticipate that we'll continue to see some headwinds in that space. The team understands that and is putting the strategies into place in order to recover margins as we move forward. 
We will also be heightened -- heightening our focus around revenue growth management. That discipline is going to be really embedded much more so, given the fact that we've now put some analytical processes in place to help the teams, as I outlined, which we think is terrific. It will give the teams a lot more confidence on the pricing that we're taking, to ensure that we're working with our trade partners to grow category at the same time as we take pricing to recover costs. So we're pleased with that.  
Likewise, had a lot of discussions over the last couple of months on our grids, our new product grids, relative to premium innovation and making sure that we continue to focus on that area of the business, where, as you know, historically, we have under-indexed. And we've seen good progress against that, particularly as you look at some of the premium businesses that we have around the world, whether it be elmex, meridol, or some of the prices we've taken on our therapeutic bundles within the Colgate portfolio. So overall, a tough raw material environment will continue to be very choppy, but we're very focused in terms of taking pricing and ensuring that we push our premium innovation moving forward."

You've come to know Colgate and the fact that we consider our supply chain a competitive advantage for us. And that is the fact that we operate globally with some of the most efficient facilities around the world. And the benefit of that has obviously translated into the strong gross margin progression that we've seen over the years. 
That being said, when you operate a global supply chain, you're not immune to decisions taken locally that will impact that. And obviously, in Asia, where we have seen governments taking actions to stop the spread of COVID, whether it be that or obviously impacting some of our suppliers and our third-party contractors, we've seen disruption in the supply chain. And as a result of that, we have the contingencies in place to move that production elsewhere, which the team has done just a tremendous job in servicing the sales need of the business. 
And you've seen that, obviously, in the acceleration or the continuous good top line growth that we've had. And that's a function of our supply chain, ensuring that we meet the demand of our products and our retailers. And we moved production around the world to do that. That comes with a cost that certainly we incurred in the quarter.  
Some of the disruptions specifically related to what we've referred to in our commentary, we're moving through those very quickly. We have moved behind one that was quite significant. And we're back to where we needed to be in terms of output, and we're back to pretty close on some of the other ones. We expect that to be fully back in capacity by the end of the quarter, this quarter. 
But that being said, the environment is very unpredictable. And we'll continue to try to anticipate some of these things moving forward, as we've done, but one can never be for sure when a government decides to come in and shut down a province or an area based on their needs. Likewise, this has a big impact, obviously, on the rest of the supply chain, whether it be raw material sourcing, whether it be our contractors. 
You heard in John's commentary, we did take some decisions, particularly in North America, around some of the contractors that we use in order to clean that up and move into a supply chain strategy that allows us to exit some of those and get more efficiencies moving forward. So we're taking all the right decisions, moving through the issues that we had in the third quarter, but we're not immune to the unpredictability of the supply chain environment that everyone is faced with today."

Listen, the pet business has been terrific, obviously. I think a lot of the change in strategies that we deployed a couple of years ago, which, again, are based foundationally on exactly all the stuff we're trying to deploy across the world, really working on the core of our business, looking at premium innovation and continuing to really dial up our focus on high-growth channels. And that's exactly what's unfolded over the last couple of years. And that strategy is continuing, obviously, to get sharper and sharper as we execute it more broadly across the Hill's network around the world. 
A lot of that growth has come out of North America, which has been terrific. I mean the double-digit growth compounding each other, U.S. had another outstanding quarter in the third quarter. Again, we're benefiting from a quite buoyant category. But the important part that you called out is we're growing share quite consistently, not only across our wellness products or our core products, but also our therapeutic products and Prescription Diet. 
We're seeing, obviously, veterinarians open back up. That is certainly improving the consumption of our Prescription Diet. We talked at length about the innovation process we had behind Hill's, which, I think, is second to none in the category right now, bringing real science and real therapeutic benefits to pet owners. And we're seeing that translate into, obviously, more penetration and growing share. 
We continue to talk about the low awareness of Hill's, both in North America and around the world. That affords us a significant opportunity as we continue to build that brand consistently all over the world, and we're continuing to invest behind that business. Despite the fact that raw materials are a headwind, we're not going to jeopardize the health of the brand by cutting back on our investment. We will continue to invest to grow awareness and that ultimately is growing penetration in the category. 
So we feel very good about where we are. Obviously, the comparisons continue to get tough, but those have been tough. And we continue to see good progress on the strategy, our ability to take pricing and our ability to bring in new consumers to the franchise."

And I was wondering if you could just expand on that.
Do you think like a lack of scale or efficiency or something else in the manufacturing base has been a cause of the margin compression in that business? And do you have opportunities to offset that?

Sure. Yes, let me jump into that in a little bit more detail. Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in the quarter. Logistics was probably the most significant headwind we had in the last couple of months versus where we were previously. 
Obviously, you're not -- you're clearly aware of the logistics industry and whatever -- what's going on, tighter capacity, tighter labor, higher costs, obviously -- which have obviously fueled significant increases in rates internally within North America, not to mention the fact that there's a lot of congestion going on and a lot of delays in getting product to and from where it needs to be. So as a result, we've been very focused on working with our retailers to ensure that we can continue to improve upon that. 
The other areas I mentioned earlier, we have this incredibly efficient global supply chain, but we do source product from different parts of the world. And you've seen, obviously, ocean freight increases -- increased dramatically over the last 3 months or 4 months. We have not been immune to that. North America, quite frankly, brings quite a bit of its product from overseas. While we have very substantial manufacturing presence in North America, we do bring product from overseas, which has obviously been a victim of those price increases we've seen in ocean freights. 
The other one is we have seen increased demand, particularly in some of our Oral Care products. And we want to continue to service that as we always have, consistently and reliably to our trade partners. And as a result of that, we made decisions to airfreight product in to ensure that we had sufficient supply for our retailers. That airfreight did not come without a significant cost. We will move through that, clearly, as we move through this year and into next year. And so we'll see those costs come out. 
And as you alluded to in your question, we did take some important strategic decisions on how we look at our network and our supply chain, both from a contractor standpoint as well as what we source internally within our facilities, and made some decisions in the quarter that will allow us to rework some of those contracts and hopefully drive more profitability in the long term. 
So overall, we're pleased. Good Oral Care growth, which is obviously where we want to see that business continue to grow. The business is looking at, obviously, a pricing environment that's becoming more conducive to take pricing historically, which has not been the case. And they're very focused on their new product grids around premium innovation, which is a strong plan for 2022 and a resurgence of focus around revenue growth management, given how important it is that we offset some of that compression we're seeing at the margin line. 
So overall, we're -- a difficult quarter for North America, but they've got the plans in place. And we think some of the things that we were working through in the quarter will be behind us as we move forward into '22."

Just in some of your bigger markets, I figured you guys are a good company to ask about what you're seeing on the ground. You had 3.5% growth in emerging markets on the volume side, which is good but not great. And I'm just wondering if there's something other than just tough comps, if there's a change in the way consumers shop or how much they have to spend kind of from a high-level, big picture perspective."

Obviously, that was drawn down by some of the shutdowns we saw across Asia and the lack of mobility. Out Southeast Asia, in fact, very little mobility. We saw categories fall off quite dramatically across Southeast Asia, and that certainly had an impact on volume in the quarter. And as you heard John mention, if you really want to dimensionalize a lot of the volume softness in the quarter, it was liquid hand soap, which was a headwind of 400 basis points in the North America business alone. 
But let me step back to your broader question on what's going on around the world coming out of COVID and what we're seeing in terms of category behaviors. Oral Care was not a COVID beneficiary. And obviously, it was not in the same cap as we saw from some of our Personal Care businesses, which saw a significant acceleration in consumption and a more systemic behavior change across the world. 
So Oral Care, as mobility comes back into the market, we continue to see the Oral Care categories growing, and that's good for us long term. Obviously, getting more and more consumers back in the stores will allow more consumption and more category-driven initiatives to take place. And so we think, over the longer term, we're going to see Oral Care continue to accelerate. 
Personal Care and Home Care were obviously quite significant beneficiaries during COVID. While the liquid hand soap has taken a significant drop off this year, it still remains above the 2019 levels. And as you rightfully said, we're the #1 liquid hand so player, certainly in North America and around the world. And that we'll see that behavior at least stay with the consumer above the'19 levels, but certainly not anywhere close to where they were in 2020. 
Hygiene products that we're very focused on in our Home Care business, whether it be dish liquids or floor cleaners, I think we'll continue to see nice growth in those categories. You heard John mention the Home Care growth that we've seen. As more and more consumers stay home, obviously, there's more dishes being cleaned and more floors being cleaned, and that has allowed that category to continue to be quite robust. But as consumers move back and mobility comes back in the markets or people return to work, you may see a little bit softness in those longer term. But overall, we think we're positioned well, particularly in the Oral Care space. 
If you go to pet food, obviously, the significant adoption that we've seen over the last 2 years during COVID and the fact that we're now executing much, much better against our strategy, we feel very good about where the -- where things are moving there. And there has been a behavior change, unquestionably, in that category where consumers have returned to science and nutrition and very focused on that space, which we are obviously very, very driven by right now."

I want to come back to the pricing strategy and implications on gross margin over the next 12 months. So specifically, with all the pricing that's going into place, you guys have done a fantastic job of funding the growth for decades. My question is, is the intention, as you sit here today with all the volatility in the environment, that you can fully offset the input cost pressure and everything you're dealing with on a supply chain perspective with pricing and productivity? 
Is that a realistic ambition? Is that the realistic goal as you're sitting here from a risk management perspective? Is that something you think you can do? Or is the cost inflation and supply chain pressures just too great at this point? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about it, how you're pricing and how you're thinking about productivity. 
And then if I could just sneak in 1 related question. A lot of interest around demand elasticity, which has been relatively low, I think, across many categories, just observe -- and which we understand was going to vary by category, by geography, by channel. Just some broader observations there, Noel, what you're seeing so far with the pricing in place for your business would be helpful."

So Kevin, you obviously watched us closely and price has always been a key driver of our organic growth, given how we look at the markets around the world. And we've consistently looked for quick ways to get pricing in the market, not only to drive category growth, but obviously, to protect the margin, which ultimately allows us to protect the advertising. 
And it's worth mentioning that, obviously, on a 2-year stack, that this was the highest pricing number we've seen in many years for us. So again, I think it reflects a consistent discipline we have across the board of taking pricing quickly in the markets. You heard me talking a little bit about how we're using data and revenue growth management now to get that information on the ground quickly to the teams so they can do what they need to do to analyze to take pricing across the board. 
But it's not just going to be pricing. We will look at, obviously, premium innovation and getting our mix improved, not only within our portfolios, but channel mix as well. I talked a little bit about the importance of driving pharmacy growth around the world, which is a growth opportunity for the company, particularly in Oral Care. That typically trades at a much better margin for the company, given the therapeutic profile of those bundles. 
We're obviously going to continue to embed significant revenue growth management initiatives all over the world, not just in some of the key inflationary markets. And as we talked about earlier, we're deploying some pretty nice strategies around the emerging markets right now to ensure that we get pricing up beyond just list prices. 
The other piece of this is productivity. Historically, you've seen us do a really good job around funding the growth. This quarter was no exception, adding 220 basis points to the margin line. But we're really dialing that up, not just simply from a cost standpoint, but really looking at efficiencies across the organization. And going into 2022, looking at how we look to find optimized ways to run our business more efficiently, and we'll continue to do that as we historically have done and find ways to pull costs out of the system. 
John mentioned it in his commentary, our overheads were actually down very nicely in the quarter on a percent of sales. And again, I think that's part of the cost focus that we have at looking at our business and making sure that we're finding ways to optimize. So it's going to be a multitude of different things, and we'll continue to see that, although it will take some time, to be sure. These things don't move in a straight line. We're taking pricing where we can, as quickly as we can. We're obviously watching the competitiveness of the market. 
But as I mentioned earlier, this is an environment that everyone is facing right now, which tends to allow everyone to find ways to take pricing up in the category. So we don't feel we will be in an anticompetitive position, but we will be very close to watch that markets to ensure that we continue to remain competitive. 
The other piece of this we haven't really mentioned is the advertising. And we continue to focus on being -- building our brands and being competitive in the marketplace. And that is a key driver of the consistent top line growth you're seeing in the company right now, and we'll continue to do everything we can to protect that advertising line. And obviously, working through the middle of the P&L will be critical in that regard."

We've dialed up our competitiveness, and we're seeing the benefits of that translate into better share progression, particularly across some of our premium bundles. 
We continue to support the business quite well. We think we're in a good place where we need to be. But obviously, as any market, I would say, more support is always better. We're looking for increased efficiencies in that business as we move forward in order to accelerate gross margin. 
As I mentioned earlier, North America was disproportionately hit with raw material inflation and logistics. And we took decisions very deliberately in the quarter to address demand that obviously had an effect in that quarter. So we anticipate that will start to come out as we move through the fourth quarter and certainly as we move into the first half of 2022. 
That being said, the raw material environment continues to be very volatile and unpredictable, and we'll take the decisions that we need to take to remain competitive.

Listen, we've historically led pricing in so many of our markets. And in the emerging markets, you tend to see a little bit more elasticity early on, but we are focused on ensuring that our innovation process is across multiple price tiers. And so when you combine pricing with innovation at the same time, we find that we can rebuild consumption quite quickly. So elasticity tends to dissipate over time, certainly, as we get the new innovation in the market and communicate that. So we're quite confident in where we are in emerging markets. 
Developed markets tend to be a little bit more difficult. You know, historically, taking pricing in Europe and North America has been a challenge. We have certainly shifted a lot of our focus to now relaunching brands, relaunching the core, bringing more premium innovation in the market in order to drive pricing. And typically then, as you bring value-added, consumer-oriented benefits to the category, you can take pricing, and therefore, the elasticity isn't as dramatic. So we will see it over time. 
I think that as everyone is raising pricing, it's fundamentally in the categories that we compete in. That tends to reduce elasticity as well. One might ask, where is private label in this environment? Private label shares were down in every single category in which we compete fundamentally. So the news is big brands are winning. And I think as long as you bring good quality innovation, you continue to support that innovation with good content, and it's personalized and targeted, we think we can offset some of the elasticity. 
But that being said, the raw material environment is significant. And pricing will be significant over the next few quarters in order to offset that moving forward. But we want to do that to make sure we protect our advertising line."

As I look at it, I think I see directional improvements. They're evident this quarter sequentially.

So Oral Care continues to drive good sequential growth quarter-to-quarter. We talked about it, mid-singles in the quarter, high singles on the year. Obviously, the Pet Nutrition business, double digits, comping double digits. So again, I think some terrific progress there. 
Personal Care significantly impacted by COVID-driven categories. And the liquid hand soap, which is a very big business for us in North America and around the world, obviously, we saw a significant falloff in the category. The category was down 28%, to give you some context on that. And as John mentioned, that was a 400 basis point headwind. So some of the COVID categories will certainly stabilize as we move forward, and we lap those moving into 2022.

We feel good about the segments we're competing in.

So we feel -- overall, we're pleased with the underlying momentum on Oral Care, Personal Care as we lap some of the COVID. We'll improve moving forward. We paid -- had some good discussions, particularly in North America and Europe, around some of the innovation that we need to continue to drive it. 
Our market share, interesting, though. Just as a data point, our market share on liquid hand soap in the U.S. was actually up 2 points in the quarter, given the fact that it was still down 400 basis points versus where it was last year on a volume standpoint. So again, we think we're taking the right decisions on portfolio and innovation in order to drive share and continue to recover some of the softness that we saw that was temporarily driven by the COVID expansion last year."

So look, we continue to cycle favorable working capital performance versus last year, and there's really an anomaly when you look at 2020. First of all, 2020 cash flow, driven by the unique environment, was up significantly. While we're down year-to-year, I think if you look back and compare to '18 and '19, you'll see that it's more in line. Higher raw materials pricing certainly put upward pressure on our inventories. 
But I think, important to note, as you mentioned, free cash flow is -- you'll see the investment we're making in the business in CapEx. So CapEx, up roughly $120 million. That's really an investment, as Noel talked about earlier, in the long-term health of our business and what we're looking to grow. So that investment has an impact on free cash flow, but we think it's incredibly important for the long term. 
So if you step back and look at cash flow where we are today, we're not concerned about the positioning. We think we're confident in our ability to generate that cash. We're confident in our ability to invest in the future of the company through CapEx. So we're comfortable with the current positioning on free cash flow."

I think the answer is everyone is -- no one is immune to the inflation that we're seeing across the market, both from a raw material standpoint or from a logistics standpoint. Obviously, they may have different constituents that look at their business differently than public companies or big multinational companies. But in any case, no one is immune to it. 
And I've had discussions and been able to get out and travel a bit and talk to retailers, I mean, retailers are recognizing, even on their own private label brands, they're going to have to take pricing to offset the significant inflation that's being absorbed in the market right now. So I expect that you'll see all boats rise, so to speak, in this environment, that pricing will go up. There will be certainly some delay with local players as they tend to try to search out a bit more volume as the big players take pricing. 
But again, I think if you can combine the pricing with the right innovation, which we're very focused on delivering and adding value to the consumer, that the local brands have to react to that in some form or fashion, either with their own innovation or with their own price increases in order to stay competitive from a support standpoint. So I don't anticipate there's going to be a significant issue. 
Javier, you know our business really well. You know that we innovate across all price points, and we have significant focus that's very deliberate in markets and looking at shares and our innovation process across each of the key price segments that we compete in. And that will certainly be the case as we move forward."

And I think it's very clear that we have reaccelerated the top line of the company. And that has been our core focus for everyone in the organization, is this growth mindset that talks about elevating our core, our adjacencies and faster-growth channels and doing that across all categories in all geographies. 
And if you take a basis of 2 years ago, that's exactly what we were delivering against right now. So the investment, we believe, is fueling that growth. Obviously, the strategies and the execution are a big part of it, but we feel very strongly that the acceleration that we've had in investment, both on the Oral Care side as well as the Pet Nutrition side, have clearly delivered top line growth. 
Now we would like to see it be reflected in some of the Nielsen-based share readings, but the market is very complex now. The go-to-market strategies and the path to purchase for consumers is much more complex than it ever was in the past and consumers moving between channels and, obviously, the emergence of online, which is quite significant. And in some markets, like China, has become a very significant part of the category, and we're seeing very strong share growth there. So overall, we feel the top line is moving in the right direction. The investment is supporting that. 
That being said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver ROI against every dollar in the P&L. And we have brought in resources from the outside and amplified our capacity around the world, working with WPP, our partner, to get much more granular and much more analytical about how we're investing, particularly our digital spend, to make sure it's targeted, and we're getting ROI for that spend. And we're getting much, much better at that. 
So as we look at our advertising, we'll continue to be competitive in terms of what's needed in the marketplace, continue to ensure the health of our brands are protected. But we're very focused, from a productivity and efficiency standpoint, looking at that bucket of spend and making it work harder for us. And that's exactly what we'll expect to see in 2022 as well."

And that pricing certainly had a little bit of impact on volume shares in the quarter, but nothing that's terribly concerning to us. It's what we consider not real profitable volume, given that we're losing to the lower end of the market. 
Some of our competitors have been highly aggressive with their promotional levels. And we decided to protect the margin in the P&L and continue to invest in building the brands. Interesting if you look at some of our equity measures in that marketplace, particularly given that we focus now on really supporting the equity as well as innovation, I was -- I attended their budget review just recently, and they look terrific. 
So again, I think we feel like we've got a very strong position in that market. We sacrificed a little bit of the promotional share, but that is not unusual when we take pricing and lead the market. And we'll continue to ramp up innovation and ensure that we remain competitive, but nothing to be concerned of. 
Brazil, likewise, which you didn't ask about, but I'll mention that shares are flat there and doing very, very well, particularly as we see great growth in the pharmacy channel. So the balance of our portfolio has gotten much more therapeutic, which is obviously more profitable for us in the long term. 
So we're pleased with some of -- our 2 big markets. And you heard John mention Colombia is back on track, given the political disruptions we saw last quarter, and driving some nice growth for us. So across Latin America, good. Not concerned about Mexico at this point."
