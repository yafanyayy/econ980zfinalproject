Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm pleased we've delivered a strong quarter and a solid year. Despite the challenging environment, our 2020 results demonstrate",1352,"Thank you, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm pleased we've delivered a strong quarter and a solid year. Despite the challenging environment, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the benefits of becoming an independent Otis. We grew adjusted earnings for the second year in a row, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, expanded our product and service offerings and remained agile to support our customers as the pandemic evolved. 
We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points in 2020, following 8 years without margin expansion as a segment of UTC, demonstrating the benefits of our independence. I could not be prouder of our 69,000 Otis colleagues who rose to the unique challenges presented throughout the year and never wavered in their commitment to provide essential services to our customers. And we did this while staying true to who we are, recognizing the challenges within our communities and allowing our Otis absolutes to keep each other safe and guide our actions and behaviors toward a more equitable future. 
For the full year, organic sales were down 2.1%. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $52 million, a $17 million improvement from the midpoint of our prior outlook. Margin expanded 70 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the service segment throughout the year. Adjusted EPS was $2.52, up $0.28 or 12.5% versus the prior year and a $0.10 improvement from our prior outlook. 
Now turning to Page 4. In our New Equipment segment, we grew share by 60 basis points with growth in all major regions. We proudly marked the 20th anniversary of our Gen2 platform and hit a major milestone, surpassing more than 1 million Gen2 units delivered to date. We continue to innovate, introducing new solutions for customers. For example, in India and other developing markets, we introduced the Gen2 Prime, a low-cost entry-level elevator. And in China, we began shipping new equipment units enabled with our IoT platform, Otis ONE. This year, we'll expand this offering to include shipping IoT-enabled units in the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
And we continue to pilot Gen360, our next-generation digitally native elevator that brings the advantages of connectivity into a new more compact platform. We anticipate formally launching this transformational solution in the EMEA region later this year. We enhanced our sales force's ability to address the market by increasing sales coverage mid-single digits, including adding more than 850 agents and distributors in China and implemented tools to improve efficiency on the back end. Today, more than 85% of our business is on a common CRM system, and we continue to find new ways to reach customers in this dynamic and more digitally-enabled environment. 
Service is the core of our business. In 2020, we added to our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by approximately 2%, with growth in all major regions, including high single-digit growth in China. This growing portfolio, which accelerates our recurring revenue business model, along with cost containment actions and productivity initiatives, allowed us to grow earnings. This resulted in adjusted margin expansion in all 4 quarters and 110 basis points of expansion for the year. 
I'm pleased with our progress made on IoT deployment. We added approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units as planned, bringing us to approximately 540,000 connected units. Over the medium term, we plan to accelerate portfolio connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from the roughly 25% currently connected, creating value for our customers and productivity benefits for Otis. 
This year, organic modernization sales were flat globally as we faced project delays in some regions due to COVID-19. However, modernization demand in Asia Pacific was particularly strong, with orders up approximately 30% and sales up double digits, driven largely by regulatory demand. Our operational initiatives generated favorable outcomes. We're very focused on material and service productivity to offset headwinds from labor inflation and commodities. Approximately 70% of our service cost base is labor, and approximately 70% of our new equipment cost base is material. We have material productivity initiatives to more than offset any potential impacts from raw materials. And in 2020, we achieved our goal of 3% material cost savings, helping to offset some of the volume headwinds in new equipment. 
The early actions taken by our supply chain team, leveraging our scale, rationalizing spend and taking cost out of products, provided the protection and assurance even during COVID that we would deliver on commitments made to customers. Our focus on cost containment extended to adjusted SG&A, where we reduced expenses by $38 million versus the prior year while expanding our sales coverage. 
As noted, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow with conversion of 143%, exceeding our prior outlook by $150 million. We channeled our strong cash generation into our capital allocation strategy, including bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale and density, $350 million to repay debt ahead of our original schedule and returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the last 3 quarters of the year. 
We made significant progress on our tax structure throughout the year, reducing our adjusted tax rate by 370 basis points versus the prior year and 260 basis points better than Investor Day expectations. We expect over the medium term to bring our adjusted tax rate to a range of 25% to 28%. And as a final comment to 2020 and amid promising news of vaccine approvals and distribution plans, the 3-month study using scientific data and analysis on elevator airflow, sponsored by Otis and led by a Purdue University professor and indoor air quality expert, concluded that elevators have significant air exchange by design and required by code, and a short elevator ride has a risk of exposure level less than that of outdoor dining. 
Turning to Slide 5 and starting with the industry's outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals remain solid. We are encouraged by the pace of recovery and signs of wider availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The industry's New Equipment segment is expected to return to growth in all regions, with mid-single-digit growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in EMEA and slight growth in the Americas. The recovery in New Equipment will continue to feed the global installed base and present future service opportunities. 
The core of our business is based on our service model, and the service market itself is expected to grow about 1 million units per year globally industry-wide. Industry installed base in the Americas is expected to grow low single digits. EMEA, where roughly 50% of the Otis maintenance portfolio sits, is expected to grow low single digits. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth, driven by China. 
At Otis, we are confident in the momentum we built in 2020 and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Looking specifically at our 2021 Otis outlook. For the year, we expect sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% with organic sales growth of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $125 million to $175 million, and adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 6% to 10% versus prior year and $0.20 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with conversion of approximately 120% of GAAP net income. 
We will remain disciplined in our capital deployment and are well positioned to start share repurchases, following $150 million of debt repayment that was already completed in January. The foundation we built this year as an independent company, along with the expected recovery in our end markets, gives us confidence that our strategy is working for our customers and shareholders. Our operating leverage, our global footprint, our successful innovation program, our capital management and strong balance sheet and our industry-leading colleagues give me full confidence we can deliver on our outlook this year and many years beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3%, driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment busine",1473,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3%, driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment business, partially offset by the expected decline in the service segment. 
Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 8% or $36 million and up $19 million at constant currency as higher New Equipment volume and strong material and service productivity was partially offset by the impact of lower service volume, unfavorable price/mix and field inefficiencies in the New Equipment business. 
Our focus on execution drove 50 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 40% or $0.19, driven by $0.05 of operating profit growth and $0.11 from a lower adjusted tax rate. As Judy mentioned earlier, these results were $0.10 ahead of prior outlook, driven by better-than-expected growth in the New Equipment business, increased benefit from material productivity and a slightly better service pricing environment. 
Moving to Slide 7. New Equipment orders were down 3.5% at constant currency, a strong order intake in EMEA and Asia, driven by China that was up double digits, was more than offset by a 21% decline in the Americas, due to a tough compare and weakness in the northeast and larger metropolitan areas in the western region of United States. Awards, which typically precede order booking by a couple of months, were stable in the quarter in North America. Net booked margin, adjusted for mix, was down 50 basis points in the quarter and backlog was up 2% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, Europe and China, with overall backlog margin down slightly versus the prior year. 
New Equipment organic sales were up 4.8%, with Americas and EMEA up about 18% and 5%, respectively, driven by strong backlog conversion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Asia. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $7 million in the segment, and margin expanded 20 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity more than offset incremental investments in China to develop agent and distributor channel, unfavorable price/mix and field inefficiencies. 
Service segment results on Slide 8. The number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 2%, and modernization orders were up 4.9% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets, was partially offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% in the fourth quarter, with contractual maintenance demand up slightly while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. However, we were encouraged by the repair business improving sequentially over the prior periods, with a lower year-over-year rate of decline compared to the second and the third quarter. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points, and profit grew $8 million at constant currency. A strong contribution from productivity was partially offset by the impact from lower volume. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. 
Overall, full year results on Slide 9 reflect solid performance, with $52 million of adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency and 70 basis points of margin expansion despite organic sales being down 2.1%. The service business was particularly resilient, growing adjusted operating profit at constant currency by $55 million and margin by 100 basis points, notwithstanding a slight decline in organic sales, as our focus on productivity initiatives continued to yield results with maintenance hours per unit down close to 6% versus 2019. 
Despite the environment, we are pleased with the operational progress we made in New Equipment business. Operating profit was down $45 million at constant currency on 4% organic sales decline, with decremental margins more or less in line with our contribution margins. We achieved the goal of 3% material cost savings in 2020, partially offsetting the headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in lower volume, the associated under-absorption of costs, field inefficiencies and higher bad debt expense. 
Cost containment efforts were also a large contributor to profit growth. And full year adjusted SG&A expense was down close to $40 million versus prior year. At the same time, we maintained the investments in R&D and other strategic project at 1.6% of sales, which was about flat versus the prior year. Full year adjusted EPS was up 12.5% or $0.28 versus the prior year, driven by $0.07 from strong operating performance and $0.15 from the progress we are making on reducing our adjusted tax rate, down 370 basis points to 30.4%. 
Net interest was also favorable by $0.06, reflecting the benefit of $350 million of debt repayment and $500 million of refinancing during the year. This EPS performance is not only better than the outlook provided in October but also better than the pre-COVID outlook provided in February on our Investor Day and caps a successful first year as a public company. 
As we look forward to 2021 on Slide 10, we feel confident of growth across all key metrics, given the higher starting New Equipment backlog, resiliency of the maintenance business in 2020, normalizing job site and building access levels and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement. Even though the rate of improvement slowed in Q4 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, we do expect year-over-year compares to turn favorable in the second quarter of 2021. 
These encouraging trends, combined with the strong foundation we built in 2020, gives us confidence to grow overall organic sales by 2% to 4%, with adjusted operating profit by $125 million to $175 million, with 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion. We expect sales, operating profit and margins to improve in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 8% or $0.20 at the midpoint. This year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit outlook and a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5%, partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest cost from the full year impact of debt placed at spin. 
We expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with conversion at approximately 120% of GAAP net income. This reflects the strong earnings growth outlook, partially offset by incremental interest and nonrecurring tax-related payments in 2021. Given our strong working capital performance in 2020, a reduction of more than $90 million or close to 25% from 2019 year-end balances, we are holding working capital flat in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook. 
Our capital deployment plans remain on track, and we have completed a previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment with a $150 million payment in January and expect share repurchases of $300 million in 2021, a year ahead of the original schedule at spin. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The New Equipment business is projected to be up between 2% to 5%, driven by accelerated conversion of the backlog that was up 2% in 2020 and the expected return to growth in the market. We expect broad-based recovery, with all 3 regions returning to growth in 2021: Americas up low to mid-single digits, EMEA up low single digits and Asia up mid-single digits, driven by growth in China. 
In the service segment, we expect maintenance and repair sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance sales growing from a stable base and recovery in discretionary repairs that will accelerate post Q1. Modernization sales should be up low to mid-single digits, with Asia Pacific maintaining the growth momentum from an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by the regulatory requirements and other regions returning to growth as they convert the higher year-end backlog. Overall, the sales growth of 2% to 4% represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020 with growth across all regions and all lines of business. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 12. We expect operating profit to be up $125 million to $175 million and up $75 million to $125 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefit of volumes returning to pre-COVID levels and continued strong contribution from material and service productivity, to offset the headwinds from pricing in the New Equipment market, increases in commodity prices, step-up in maintenance expenses and incremental stand-alone costs in the first half of the year. This outlook represents the third consecutive year of strong earnings growth as we continue to execute the basics, deal with the challenges, leverage the investments we have made in the business and benefit from a market recovery. And with that, I'll request Justin to please open the line for questions."

So we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021, with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020. And we are projecting to continue this momentum into '21. So if you look at the New Equipment segment, there's a couple of drivers that are driving the growth in '21 on the earnings side. The biggest piece of that is the segment returns to growth in '21 after a challenging 2020, with 3.5% organic sales growth at the midpoint. And the drop-through we'll get from that is a strong contributor to earnings growth. 
Along with strong material productivity, we still think we can deliver the 3% material cost productivity after absorbing the impact from commodity headwinds. And this, along with the restructuring actions that we took last year, will help us offset the incremental stand-alone cost, headwind from some of the actions that we took, some of the short-term actions that we took last year to protect the earnings and any adverse pricing that may materialize. I mean, the pricing was more or less stable. I mean, we were down slightly on the backlog so we expect some headwinds of pricing, but we're obviously building that in into our guidance. 
So the key here is that we are able to grow margins on the New Equipment side despite the commodity headwinds, increase in stand-alone costs, temporary costs coming back and the pricing pressures. This has been the key part of our strategy. We've been talking about it since our first earnings call back in April last year, that we understand the challenges we are facing, and we have these operational excellence programs that we're working on, whether it's backlog acceleration or material productivity to deal with anything that may arise. So we feel good about where we sit, Jeff, right now, Jeff."

So we do expect it to accelerate and we will be using '21 to fill the '22 backlog so that we go in strong and keep this momentum going. 
Orders on any quarter basis aren't really the best determinant. They do go up and down. There's different levels in different regions. But we did have -- we do have -- we were down 3.5% at constant on the New Equipment side. I would point out, our modernization orders were up almost 5%.

So that shows the steps that we are taking to accelerate our backlog conversion is happening. And we'll continue that into 2021.

I think we're starting to see the benefits of the IoT Otis ONE investment. We're clearly seeing the benefits, the productivity benefits of all the apps that our field professionals have and are being able to put in play in. But Otis ONE, we're starting to see that. We deployed just about 100,000 new units in Otis ONE, primarily in China, EMEA and in North America. And there's real demand pull for that from our field professionals. It's really giving them that advanced look, that ability to be able to fix things remote and to really bring down our callbacks. 
Our retention rate, we think that's really where you're going to see this in the retention rate. And our retention rate, we ended the year at 94%, which is industry-leading and is up from earlier in the year when we were closer to 93%. So we're seeing it there. And then the reason we believe in it, we're going to be deploying at least that same number this year. 
And we're also now prepositioning our Otis ONE on our units that we're shipping from the factory. It's already started in China. We're adding the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. That will take some time to work its way through, obviously, the warranty period, a year or so in those places. But we believe in it. We're seeing the early returns and we're seeing the productivity gains, and our customers are able to really have that access for really operational knowledge, whether they're on-site or not. Is my elevator working? Am I getting more uptime? And we think that's just going to buy more stickiness, and that's the whole thesis of our connected strategy."

So our commodity spend, Cai, is about total quality spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right, if you look at kind of what we are seeing right now for '21, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe high -- a little higher in",381,"Yes. So our commodity spend, Cai, is about total quality spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right, if you look at kind of what we are seeing right now for '21, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe high -- a little higher in Q1 right now and the fall was a little bit lower. So it averages it out about 7% to 8%. 
So the way we're thinking about the commodity issue for next year is, it was a tailwind in 2020. It's -- for '21, it is a headwind, given where the steel prices sit today. And the spreadsheet math would suggest, hey, that could be like a $20 million-plus headwind for us. But the other part that has simultaneously happened is that both euro and the renminbi have appreciated against the dollar. And we buy in local currency in both Europe and China, so we should be able to offset part of this commodity increase by just appreciation of the local currency. So that's 1 piece of it. 
The second piece is that we're working really, really hard on material productivity to offset the commodity headwinds. I think that's what Judy said earlier. And we're starting '21 in a much, much better position than we did in 2020, given the cadence that we gained last year. And a carryover benefit from the projects that we started midyear in 2020 is higher than where we were at this point last year. So we still think we can deliver 3% material productivity after absorbing the commodity headwinds and grow our New Equipment margins, which is what I said earlier in response to Jeff's question. 
The other piece, to the extent the dollar weakness is causing the commodity headwinds, we're also seeing the $50 million FX gain on our earnings overall. So it's in a different line of the P&L, but some of the commodity weakness is because of appreciation of -- the depreciation of the dollar. But we gained that on the overall earnings side. So a little bit of a trade-off. But overall, it is an issue but it's built into our guidance, and we feel we can get to 3% material productivity and grow our New Equipment margins in '21."

So let me start with cash and then we can talk about the minority JV payment. So if you look at our cash, really strong year last year. We ended $150 million better than what we had guided and net income came in better. Working capital was really, really good. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we reduced working capital by $90 million, which is 1/4 for working capital, which was a fantastic performance, given what you hear overall. 
And as we look at '21, the biggest driver is improvement in earnings, Julian, as you referenced. But there are 2 issues that we are trying to deal with next year. One is just the timing of the interest payments. So just the way where the interest payment is landed, we do have an extra interest payment in '21, which we did not have in 2020, given the timing of when we raised debt. The other issue is that we do need to make a tax-related payment for an old tax matter that we've inherited from UTC. So we built that into our guidance as well. That matter is still ongoing but we've built that into our guidance. 
Our -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we have not built any working capital improvement into our guidance at this point. We'll obviously keep working at the midpoint of our guidance because when we keep working, we'll keep working there hard. But our plan at this point doesn't contemplate that. $1.35 billion for '21 is a solid number. It's 120% of GAAP net income and substantially higher than where we expected '21 to be on Investor Day. So we think it's a solid start to the year. 
On NCI for 2020, not any 1 single driver. It was a combination of various things, a couple of million here and there and then FX was a little bit of a headwind as well. So I wouldn't read too much into where we ended on NCI for 2020."

Our patents have gone up 4x since that same period, and our new product releases since 2018 are up 250%. So we've made a conscious effort to really reinvigorate the innovation engine and the DNA in this company. 
So some of that is a little bit of catch-up. But others like our Gen360 is going to be an incredibly new, digitally native with an electronic safety, first in the industry that code authorities have to approve. It's going to revolutionize really how people are gracefully handled when there's an issue in the elevator and the elevator has to actually stop. It's going to gracefully bring them down to an actual landing floor so that customers and, more importantly, passengers aren't entrapped at any length of time. 
So our destination dispatch product is, we believe, is industry-leading. We've released the Compass 360 product that gives us even more capability. And we found customers are really very interested in that whole destination product because it's touch-free. And we've always talked about the safety of our products. Now we also talk about the health offerings of our products. And our team moved very rapidly during the COVID era to generate new products, whether it be gesture, whether it be our app -- our eCall app that allows you either via Bluetooth or other connectivity to use your phone. 
And then we've tried not just to hit the high end with the Gen360 in terms of complexity and features, we've also tried, as we talked about our Gen2 Prime, to find a nice, stable, affordable entrant that will be a workhorse for us in India, in the Middle East, in Africa, in other emerging markets. So we're trying to hit that whole span. 
On the Service side, when we rolled out Otis ONE, we made a conscious decision to roll it out as a productivity enabler first. And we think we're going to drive 1 point of productivity with Otis ONE, and we're going to keep adding units to do that. The reason we did that and the strategy we did that, that we took was a density-based approach. There's not value -- as much value if you just sprinkle sensors or IoT units across the globe. So we did a very focused density-based, route-based attempt and focus to be able to actually yield that productivity. And that will grow in productivity but it will also grow in terms of customer value and retention for us, and it provides a foundation for us to add services. 
So a little bit of catch-up, no argument, based on some prior year's lack of investments pre 2015. But I think we've really accelerated, both in the mechanical, the digital, the electronic and, most importantly, the passenger experience."

But if you look at Americas overall, John, I think the markets are kind of uncertain, right? I mean we've seen, as Judy mentioned in her prepared remarks, we've seen good growth in Asia. We know kind of feel good about the mid-single-digit growth there. If you look at EMEA, we feel good about the low single digit. Americas remains challenging and the market was down mid-teens last year. So obviously, we did better than the market. 
And if you look at the Dodge Momentum Index, that just turned strongly positive in December, for the first time in several months. So that's an initial sign of recovery since COVID. But if you look at the Architectural Billings Index, that's still under 50, but now the inquiries have been positive for 4 months straight. So kind of mixed signals. And if you look at the range of guidance that we are giving, that -- part of that range is driven by the Americas growth outlook. So that's a contributor to that. 
But overall, again, I think we discussed with Nigel earlier, we feel good about all the steps that we've taken in terms of improving our sales coverage, kind of 7 points in China, 10 points overall, new product introductions. Our proposals were up 7% last year. So that obviously is another good sign that we can keep building on this momentum that we have and the share gain that we've enjoyed, we can keep building on that. But Americas market is uncertain but that's what we built into our guidance."

I'm pleased we've delivered a strong quarter and a solid year. Despite the challenging environment, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the benefits of becoming an independent Otis. We grew adjusted earnings for the second year in a row, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, expanded our product and service offerings and remained agile to support our customers as the pandemic evolved. We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points in 2020, following 8 years without margin expansion as a segment of UTC, demonstrating the benefits of our independence. 
I could not be prouder of our 69,000 Otis colleagues who rose to the unique challenges presented throughout the year and never wavered in their commitment to provide essential services to our customers. And we did this while staying true to who we are, recognizing the challenges within our communities and allowing our Otis Absolutes to keep each other safe and guide our actions and behaviors toward a more equitable future. 
For the full year, organic sales were down 2.1%. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $52 million, a $17 million improvement from the midpoint of our prior outlook. Margin expanded 70 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the Service segment throughout the year. Adjusted EPS was $2.52, up $0.28 or 12.5% versus the prior year and a $0.10 improvement from our prior outlook. 
Now turning to Page 4. In our New Equipment segment, we grew share by 60 basis points with growth in all major regions. We proudly marked the 20th anniversary of our Gen2 platform and hit a major milestone, surpassing more than 1 million Gen2 units delivered to date. We continue to innovate, introducing new solutions for customers. For example, in India and other developing markets, we introduced the Gen2 Prime, a low-cost, entry-level elevator. And in China, we began shipping new equipment units enabled with our IoT platform, Otis ONE. This year, we'll expand this offering to include shipping IoT-enabled units in the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. And we continue to pilot Gen360, our next-generation, digitally native elevator that brings the advantages of connectivity into a new, more compact platform. We anticipate formally launching this transformational solution in the EMEA region later this year. 
We enhanced our sales force's ability to address the market by increasing sales coverage mid-single digits, including adding more than 850 agents and distributors in China and implemented tools to improve efficiency on the back end. Today, more than 85% of our business is on a common CRM system, and we continue to find new ways to reach customers in this dynamic and more digitally-enabled environment.
Service is the core of our business. In 2020, we added to our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by approximately 2%, with growth in all major regions, including high single-digit growth in China. This growing portfolio, which accelerates our recurring revenue business model, along with cost-containment actions and productivity initiatives, allowed us to grow earnings. This resulted in adjusted margin expansion in all 4 quarters and 110 basis points of expansion for the year.
I'm pleased with our progress made on IoT deployment. We added approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units, as planned, bringing us to approximately 540,000 connected units. Over the medium term, we plan to accelerate portfolio connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from the roughly 25% currently connected, creating value for our customers and productivity benefits for Otis.
This year, organic modernization sales were flat globally as we faced project delays in some regions due to COVID-19. However, modernization demand in Asia Pacific was particularly strong with orders up approximately 30% and sales up double digits driven largely by regulatory demand. 
Our operational initiatives generated favorable outcomes. We're very focused on material and service productivity to offset headwinds from labor inflation and commodities. Approximately 70% of our Service cost base is labor, and approximately 70% of our New Equipment cost base is material. We have material productivity initiatives to more than offset any potential impacts from raw materials. And in 2020, we achieved our goal of 3% material cost savings, helping to offset some of the volume headwinds in New Equipment.
The early actions taken by our supply chain team, leveraging our scale, rationalizing spend and taking cost out of products provided the protection and assurance, even during COVID, that we would deliver on commitments made to customers. Our focus on cost containment extended to adjusted SG&A, where we reduced expenses by $38 million versus the prior year while expanding our sales coverage. 
As noted, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow with conversion of 143%, exceeding our prior outlook by $150 million. We channeled our strong cash generation into our capital allocation strategy, including bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale and density, $350 million to repay debt ahead of our original schedule and returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the last 3 quarters of the year.
We made significant progress on our tax structure throughout the year, reducing our adjusted tax rate by 370 basis points versus the prior year and 260 basis points better than Investor Day expectations. We expect, over the medium term, to bring our adjusted tax rate to a range of 25% to 28%. 
And as a final comment to 2020 and amid promising news of vaccine approvals and distribution plans, the 3-month study using scientific data and analysis on elevator airflow sponsored by Otis and led by a Purdue University professor and indoor air quality expert concluded that elevators have significant air exchange by design and required by code, and a short elevator ride has a risk of exposure level less than that of outdoor dining.
Turning to Slide 5 and starting with the industry's outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals remain solid. We are encouraged by the pace of recovery and signs of wider availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The industry's New Equipment segment is expected to return to growth in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in EMEA and slight growth in the Americas. The recovery in New Equipment will continue to feed the global installed base and present future service opportunities. 
The core of our business is based on our service model, and the service market itself is expected to grow about 1 million units per year globally industry-wide. Industry installed base in the Americas is expected to grow low single digits. EMEA, where roughly 50% of the Otis maintenance portfolio sits, is expected to grow low single digits. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth driven by China. At Otis, we are confident in the momentum we built in 2020 and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. 
Looking specifically at our 2021 Otis outlook. For the year, we expect sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% with organic sales growth of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $125 million to $175 million, and adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 6% to 10% versus prior year and $0.20 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with conversion of approximately 120% of GAAP net income.
We will remain disciplined in our capital deployment and are well positioned to start share repurchases, following $150 million of debt repayment that was already completed in January. The foundation we built this year as an independent company, along with the expected recovery in our end markets, gives us confidence that our strategy is working for our customers and shareholders. Our operating leverage, our global footprint, our successful innovation program, our capital management and strong balance sheet and our industry-leading colleagues give me full confidence we can deliver on our outlook this year and many years beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment busines",1472,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment business, partially offset by the expected decline in the Service segment.
Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 8% or $36 million and up $19 million at constant currency as higher New Equipment volume and strong material and service productivity was partially offset by the impact of lower service volume, unfavorable price/mix and field inefficiencies in the New Equipment business. Our focus on execution drove 50 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 40% or $0.19 driven by $0.05 of operating profit growth and $0.11 from a lower adjusted tax rate. As Judy mentioned earlier, these results were $0.10 ahead of prior outlook driven by better-than-expected growth in the New Equipment business, increased benefit from material productivity and a slightly better service pricing environment.
Moving to Slide 7. New Equipment orders were down 3.5% at constant currency, a strong order intake in EMEA and Asia, driven by China, that was up double digits, was more than offset by a 21% decline in the Americas due to a tough compare and weakness in the northeast and larger metropolitan areas in the western region of United States. Awards, which typically precede order booking by a couple of months, were stable in the quarter in North America. Net booked margin, adjusted for mix, was down 50 basis points in the quarter, and backlog was up 2% at constant currency driven by growth in the Americas, Europe and China with overall backlog margin down slightly versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were up 4.8% with Americas and EMEA up about 18% and 5%, respectively, driven by strong backlog conversion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Asia. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $7 million in the segment, and margin expanded 20 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity more than offset incremental investments in China to develop agent and distributor channel, unfavorable price/mix and field inefficiencies.
Service segment results on Slide 8. The number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 2%, and modernization orders were up 4.9% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets, was partially offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% in the fourth quarter with contractual maintenance demand up slightly while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. However, we were encouraged by the repair business improving sequentially over the prior periods with a lower year-over-year rate of decline compared to the second and the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points, and profit grew $8 million at constant currency. A strong contribution from productivity was partially offset by the impact from lower volume. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable.
Overall, full year results on Slide 9 reflect solid performance with $52 million of adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency and 70 basis points of margin expansion despite organic sales being down 2.1%. The Service business was particularly resilient, growing adjusted operating profit at constant currency by $55 million and margin by 100 basis points, notwithstanding a slight decline in organic sales, as our focus on productivity initiatives continued to yield results with maintenance hours per unit down close to 6% versus 2019.
Despite the environment, we are pleased with the operational progress we made in New Equipment business. Operating profit was down $45 million at constant currency on 4% organic sales decline with decremental margins more or less in line with our contribution margins. We achieved the goal of 3% material cost savings in 2020, partially offsetting the headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in lower volume, the associated under-absorption of costs, field inefficiencies and higher bad debt expense. Cost-containment efforts were also a large contributor to profit growth. And full year adjusted SG&A expense was down close to $40 million versus prior year. 
At the same time, we maintained the investments in R&D and other strategic project at 1.6% of sales, which was about flat versus the prior year. Full year adjusted EPS was up 12.5% or $0.28 versus the prior year driven by $0.07 from strong operating performance and $0.15 from the progress we are making on reducing our adjusted tax rate, down 370 basis points to 30.4%.
Net interest was also favorable by $0.06, reflecting the benefit of $350 million of debt repayment and $500 million of refinancing during the year. This EPS performance is not only better than the outlook provided in October but also better than the pre-COVID outlook provided in February on our Investor Day and caps a successful first year as a public company.
As we look forward to 2021 on Slide 10, we feel confident of growth across all key metrics given the higher starting New Equipment backlog, resiliency of the maintenance business in 2020, normalizing job site and building access levels and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement. Even though the rate of improvement slowed in Q4 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, we do expect year-over-year compares to turn favorable in the second quarter of 2021.
These encouraging trends, combined with the strong foundation we built in 2020, gives us confidence to grow overall organic sales by 2% to 4% with adjusted operating profit by $125 million to $175 million, with 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion. We expect sales, operating profit and margins to improve in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 8% or $0.20 at the midpoint. This year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit outlook and a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5%, partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest cost from the full year impact of debt placed at spin.
We expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with conversion at approximately 120% of GAAP net income. This reflects the strong earnings growth outlook, partially offset by incremental interest and nonrecurring tax-related payments in 2021. 
Given our strong working capital performance in 2020, a reduction of more than $90 million or close to 25% from 2019 year-end balances, we are holding working capital flat in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook. Our capital deployment plans remain on track, and we have completed a previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment with a $150 million payment in January and expect share repurchases of $300 million in 2021, a year ahead of the original schedule at spin.
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The New Equipment business is projected to be up between 2% to 5% driven by accelerated conversion of the backlog that was up 2% in 2020 and the expected return to growth in the market. We expect broad-based recovery with all 3 regions returning to growth in 2021: Americas up low to mid-single digits, EMEA up low single digits and Asia up mid-single digits driven by growth in China. 
In the Service segment, we expect maintenance and repair sales to be up 2% to 4% with maintenance sales growing from a stable base and recovery in discretionary repairs that will accelerate post Q1. Modernization sales should be up low to mid-single digits with Asia Pacific maintaining the growth momentum from an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by the regulatory requirements and other regions returning to growth as they convert the higher year-end backlog. Overall, the sales growth of 2% to 4% represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020 with growth across all regions and all lines of business.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 12. We expect operating profit to be up $125 million to $175 million and up $75 million to $125 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefit of volumes returning to pre-COVID levels and continued strong contribution from material and service productivity, to offset the headwinds from pricing in the New Equipment market, increases in commodity prices, step-up in maintenance expenses and incremental stand-alone costs in the first half of the year. This outlook represents the third consecutive year of strong earnings growth as we continue to execute the basics, deal with the challenges, leverage the investments we have made in the business and benefit from a market recovery. 
And with that, I'll request Justin to please open the line for questions."

Jeff, so we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021 with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020, and we are projecting to continue this momentum into '21.

Jeff, so we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021 with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020, and we are projecting to continue this momentum into '21. So if you look at the New Equipment segment, there's a couple of drivers that are driving the growth in '21 on the earnings side. The biggest piece of that is the segment returns to growth in '21 after a challenging 2020 with 3.5% organic sales growth at the midpoint, and the drop-through we'll get from that is a strong contributor to earnings growth. 
Along with strong material productivity, we still think we can deliver the 3% material cost productivity after absorbing the impact from commodity headwinds. And this, along with the restructuring actions that we took last year, will help us offset the incremental stand-alone cost, headwind from some of the actions that we took, some of the short-term actions that we took last year to protect the earnings and any adverse pricing that may materialize. I mean the pricing was more or less stable. I mean we were down slightly on the backlog, so we expect some headwinds of pricing, but we're obviously building that into our guidance. 
So the key here is that we are able to grow margins on the New Equipment side despite the commodity headwinds, increase in stand-alone costs, temporary costs coming back and the pricing pressures. This has been the key part of our strategy. We've been talking about it since our first earnings call back in April last year,that we understand the challenges we are facing, and we have these operational excellence programs that we're working on, whether it's backlog acceleration or material productivity to deal with anything that may arise. So we feel good about where we sit, Jeff -- sit here right now, Jeff."

Orders on any quarter basis aren't really the best determinant. They do go up and down. There's different levels in different regions, but we did have -- we do have -- we were down 3.5% at constant on the New Equipment side. I would point out, our modernization orders were up almost 5%.

We're clearly seeing the benefits, the productivity benefits of all the apps that our field professionals have and are being able to put in play in. But Otis ONE, we're starting to see that. We deployed just about 100,000 new units in Otis ONE, primarily in China, EMEA and in North America. And there's real demand pull for that from our field professionals. It's really giving them that advanced look, that ability to be able to fix things remote and to really bring down our callbacks.
Our retention rate, we think that's really where you're going to see this in the retention rate. And our retention rate, we ended the year at 94%, which is industry-leading, and is up from earlier in the year when we were closer to 93%. So we're seeing it there. And then the reason we believe in it, we're going to be deploying at least that same number this year. And we're also now prepositioning our Otis ONE on our units that we're shipping from the factory. It's already started in China. We're adding the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. That will take some time to work its way through, obviously, the warranty period, a year or so in those places, but we believe in it. We're seeing the early returns, and we're seeing the productivity gains. And our customers are able to really have that access for really operational knowledge, whether they're on-site or not.

So our commodity spend, Cai, is about -- total commodity spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right. You look at kind of what we are seeing right now for '21, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe high -- a little higher",382,"Yes. So our commodity spend, Cai, is about -- total commodity spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right. You look at kind of what we are seeing right now for '21, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe high -- a little higher in Q1 right now, and the fall was a little bit lower. So it averages it out to about 7% to 8%. 
So the way we're thinking about the commodity issue for next year is it was a tailwind in 2020. It's -- for '21, it is a headwind, given where the steel prices sit today. And the spreadsheet math would suggest, hey, that could be like a $20 million-plus headwind for us. But the other part that has simultaneously happened is that both euro and the renminbi have appreciated against the dollar, and we buy in local currency in both Europe and China. So we should be able to offset part of this commodity increase by just appreciation of the local currency. So that's one piece of it. 
The second piece is that we're working really, really hard on material productivity to offset the commodity headwinds. I think that's what Judy said earlier. And we're starting '21 in a much, much better position than we did in 2020 given the cadence that we gained last year. And a carryover benefit from the projects that we started midyear in 2020 is higher than where we were at this point last year. So we still think we can deliver 3% material productivity after absorbing the commodity headwinds and grow our New Equipment margins, which is what I said earlier in response to Jeff's question.
The other piece, to the extent the dollar weakness is causing the commodity headwinds, we're also seeing the $50 million FX gain on our earnings overall. So it's in a different line of the P&L, but some of the commodity weakness is because of appreciation of -- the depreciation of the dollar, but we gained that on the overall earnings side. So a little bit of a trade-off. But overall, it is an issue, but it's built into our guidance, and we feel we can get to 3% material productivity and grow our New Equipment margins in '21."

So let me start with cash, and then we can talk about the minority JV payment. So if you look at our cash, really strong year last year. We ended $150 million better than what we had guided, and net income came in better. Working capital was really, really good. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we reduced working capital by $90 million, which is 1/4 for working capital, which was a fantastic performance given what you hear overall.
And as we look at '21, the biggest driver is improvement in earnings, Julian, as you referenced. But there are 2 issues that we are trying to deal with next year. One is just the timing of the interest payments. So just the way where the interest payment is landed, we do have an extra interest payment in '21, which we did not have in 2020 given the timing of when we raised debt. The other issue is that we do need to make a tax-related payment for an old tax matter that we've inherited from UTC. So we built that into our guidance as well. That matter is still ongoing, but we've built that into our guidance.
Our -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we have not built any working capital improvement into our guidance at this point. We'll obviously keep working at the midpoint of our guidance because when we keep working, we'll keep working there hard. But our plan at this point doesn't contemplate that. $1.35 billion for '21 is a solid number. It's 120% of GAAP net income and substantially higher than where we expected '21 to be on Investor Day. So we think it's a solid start to the year.
On NCI for 2020, not any one single driver. It was a combination of various things, a couple of million here and there, and then FX was a little bit of a headwind as well. So I wouldn't read too much into where we ended on NCI for 2020."

Our patents have gone up 4x since that same period, and our new product releases since 2018 are up 250%. So we've made a conscious effort to really reinvigorate the innovation engine and the DNA in this company.
So some of that is a little bit of catch-up. But others like our Gen360 is going to be an incredibly new, digitally native with an electronic safety, first in the industry that code authorities have to approve. It's going to revolutionize really how people are gracefully handled when there's an issue in the elevator and the elevator has to actually stop. It's going to gracefully bring them down to an actual landing floor so that customers and, more importantly, passengers aren't entrapped at any length of time.
So our destination dispatch product is, we believe, is industry-leading. We've released the Compass 360 product that gives us even more capability, and we found customers are really very interested in that whole destination product because it's touch-free. And we've always talked about the safety of our products. Now we also talk about the health offerings of our products. And our team moved very rapidly during the COVID era to generate new products, whether it be gesture, whether it be our app -- our eCall app that allows you either via Bluetooth or other connectivity to use your phone. 
And then we've tried not just to hit the high end with the Gen360 in terms of complexity and features. We've also tried, as we talked about our Gen2 Prime, to find a nice, stable, affordable entrant that will be a workhorse for us in India, in the Middle East, in Africa, in other emerging markets. So we're trying to hit that whole span.
On the Service side, when we rolled out Otis ONE, we made a conscious decision to roll it out as a productivity enabler first. And we think we're going to drive 1 point of productivity with Otis ONE, and we're going to keep adding units to do that. The reason we did that and the strategy we did that, that we took was a density-based approach. There's not value -- as much value if you just sprinkle sensors or IoT units across the globe. So we did a very focused, density-based, route-based attempt and focus to be able to actually yield that productivity. And that will grow in productivity but it will also grow in terms of customer value and retention for us, and it provides a foundation for us to add services. 
So a little bit of catch-up, no argument, based on some prior year's lack of investments pre 2015. But I think we've really accelerated, both in the mechanical, the digital, the electronic and, most importantly, the passenger experience."

We now kind of feel good about the mid-single-digit growth there. If you look at EMEA, we feel good about the low single digit. Americas remains challenging, and the market was down mid-teens last year. So obviously, we did better than the market.

But if you look at the Architecture Billings Index, that's still under 50, but now the inquiries have been positive for 4 months straight, so kind of mixed signals. And if you look at the range of guidance that we are giving, that -- part of that range is driven by the Americas growth outlook. So that's a contributor to that.
But overall, again, I think we discussed with Nigel earlier, we feel good about all the steps that we've taken in terms of improving our sales coverage, kind of 7 points in China, 10 points overall, new product introductions. Our proposals were up 7% last year. So that, obviously, is another good sign that we can keep building on this momentum that we have and the share gain that we've enjoyed, we can keep building on that. But Americas market is uncertain but that's what we built into our guidance."

And the Service portfolio, as I mentioned, we had high single-digit growth in there. So we saw a nice conversion, and our retention rate went up in China as well, as did our recapture rate on units we wanted to get back. So all 3 metrics that help drive net recovery for us in China were positive.
And we think that -- that's the strategy playing out. Everything we've told you about enhanced customer stickiness, IoT, more key accounts, which have higher conversion rates, closer to the 80% range, more infrastructure, which also has higher conversion rates. So with that pivot and our strategy in China, that's where we're seeing that accelerate. Rahul, do you want to comment on the view at the macro level?"

I'm pleased we've delivered a strong quarter and a solid year. Despite the challenging environment, our 2020 results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the benefits of becoming an independent Otis. We grew adjusted earnings for the second year in a row, generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, expanded our product and service offerings and remained agile to support our customers as the pandemic evolved. We expanded adjusted margins by 70 basis points in 2020, following 8 years without margin expansion as a segment of UTC, demonstrating the benefits of our independence. 
I could not be prouder of our 69,000 Otis colleagues who rose to the unique challenges presented throughout the year and never wavered in their commitment to provide essential services to our customers. And we did this while staying true to who we are, recognizing the challenges within our communities and allowing our Otis Absolutes to keep each other safe and guide our actions and behaviors toward a more equitable future. 
For the full year, organic sales were down 2.1%. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $52 million, a $17 million improvement from the midpoint of our prior outlook. Margin expanded 70 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the Service segment throughout the year. Adjusted EPS was $2.52, up $0.28 or 12.5% versus the prior year and a $0.10 improvement from our prior outlook. 
Now turning to Page 4. In our New Equipment segment, we grew share by 60 basis points with growth in all major regions. We proudly marked the 20th anniversary of our Gen2 platform and hit a major milestone, surpassing more than 1 million Gen2 units delivered to date. We continue to innovate, introducing new solutions for customers. For example, in India and other developing markets, we introduced the Gen2 Prime, a low-cost, entry-level elevator. And in China, we began shipping new equipment units enabled with our IoT platform, Otis ONE. This year, we'll expand this offering to include shipping IoT-enabled units in the U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. And we continue to pilot Gen360, our next-generation, digitally native elevator that brings the advantages of connectivity into a new, more compact platform. We anticipate formally launching this transformational solution in the EMEA region later this year. 
We enhanced our sales force's ability to address the market by increasing sales coverage mid-single digits, including adding more than 850 agents and distributors in China and implemented tools to improve efficiency on the back end. Today, more than 85% of our business is on a common CRM system, and we continue to find new ways to reach customers in this dynamic and more digitally-enabled environment.
Service is the core of our business. In 2020, we added to our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by approximately 2%, with growth in all major regions, including high single-digit growth in China. This growing portfolio, which accelerates our recurring revenue business model, along with cost-containment actions and productivity initiatives, allowed us to grow earnings. This resulted in adjusted margin expansion in all 4 quarters and 110 basis points of expansion for the year.
I'm pleased with our progress made on IoT deployment. We added approximately 100,000 Otis ONE units, as planned, bringing us to approximately 540,000 connected units. Over the medium term, we plan to accelerate portfolio connectivity to approximately 60% of units, up from the roughly 25% currently connected, creating value for our customers and productivity benefits for Otis.
This year, organic modernization sales were flat globally as we faced project delays in some regions due to COVID-19. However, modernization demand in Asia Pacific was particularly strong with orders up approximately 30% and sales up double digits driven largely by regulatory demand. 
Our operational initiatives generated favorable outcomes. We're very focused on material and service productivity to offset headwinds from labor inflation and commodities. Approximately 70% of our Service cost base is labor, and approximately 70% of our New Equipment cost base is material. We have material productivity initiatives to more than offset any potential impacts from raw materials. And in 2020, we achieved our goal of 3% material cost savings, helping to offset some of the volume headwinds in New Equipment.
The early actions taken by our supply chain team, leveraging our scale, rationalizing spend and taking cost out of products provided the protection and assurance, even during COVID, that we would deliver on commitments made to customers. Our focus on cost containment extended to adjusted SG&A, where we reduced expenses by $38 million versus the prior year while expanding our sales coverage. 
As noted, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow with conversion of 143%, exceeding our prior outlook by $150 million. We channeled our strong cash generation into our capital allocation strategy, including bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale and density, $350 million to repay debt ahead of our original schedule and returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the last 3 quarters of the year.
We made significant progress on our tax structure throughout the year, reducing our adjusted tax rate by 370 basis points versus the prior year and 260 basis points better than Investor Day expectations. We expect, over the medium term, to bring our adjusted tax rate to a range of 25% to 28%. 
And as a final comment to 2020 and amid promising news of vaccine approvals and distribution plans, the 3-month study using scientific data and analysis on elevator airflow sponsored by Otis and led by a Purdue University professor and indoor air quality expert concluded that elevators have significant air exchange by design and required by code, and a short elevator ride has a risk of exposure level less than that of outdoor dining.
Turning to Slide 5 and starting with the industry's outlook. While market dynamics remain fluid, the industry's long-term fundamentals remain solid. We are encouraged by the pace of recovery and signs of wider availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The industry's New Equipment segment is expected to return to growth in all regions with mid-single-digit growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in EMEA and slight growth in the Americas. The recovery in New Equipment will continue to feed the global installed base and present future service opportunities. 
The core of our business is based on our service model, and the service market itself is expected to grow about 1 million units per year globally industry-wide. Industry installed base in the Americas is expected to grow low single digits. EMEA, where roughly 50% of the Otis maintenance portfolio sits, is expected to grow low single digits. And in Asia, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth driven by China. At Otis, we are confident in the momentum we built in 2020 and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. 
Looking specifically at our 2021 Otis outlook. For the year, we expect sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% with organic sales growth of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $125 million to $175 million, and adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 6% to 10% versus prior year and $0.20 at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with conversion of approximately 120% of GAAP net income.
We will remain disciplined in our capital deployment and are well positioned to start share repurchases, following $150 million of debt repayment that was already completed in January. The foundation we built this year as an independent company, along with the expected recovery in our end markets, gives us confidence that our strategy is working for our customers and shareholders. Our operating leverage, our global footprint, our successful innovation program, our capital management and strong balance sheet and our industry-leading colleagues give me full confidence we can deliver on our outlook this year and many years beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment busines",1472,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with fourth quarter results on Slide 6. Net sales returned to growth in the quarter and were up 4.2% to $3.5 billion. Organic sales were up 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in the New Equipment business, partially offset by the expected decline in the Service segment.
Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 8% or $36 million and up $19 million at constant currency as higher New Equipment volume and strong material and service productivity was partially offset by the impact of lower service volume, unfavorable price/mix and field inefficiencies in the New Equipment business. Our focus on execution drove 50 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 40% or $0.19 driven by $0.05 of operating profit growth and $0.11 from a lower adjusted tax rate. As Judy mentioned earlier, these results were $0.10 ahead of prior outlook driven by better-than-expected growth in the New Equipment business, increased benefit from material productivity and a slightly better service pricing environment.
Moving to Slide 7. New Equipment orders were down 3.5% at constant currency, a strong order intake in EMEA and Asia, driven by China, that was up double digits, was more than offset by a 21% decline in the Americas due to a tough compare and weakness in the northeast and larger metropolitan areas in the western region of United States. Awards, which typically precede order booking by a couple of months, were stable in the quarter in North America. Net booked margin, adjusted for mix, was down 50 basis points in the quarter, and backlog was up 2% at constant currency driven by growth in the Americas, Europe and China with overall backlog margin down slightly versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were up 4.8% with Americas and EMEA up about 18% and 5%, respectively, driven by strong backlog conversion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Asia. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit was up $7 million in the segment, and margin expanded 20 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity more than offset incremental investments in China to develop agent and distributor channel, unfavorable price/mix and field inefficiencies.
Service segment results on Slide 8. The number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 2%, and modernization orders were up 4.9% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets, was partially offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Service organic sales were down 1.4% in the fourth quarter with contractual maintenance demand up slightly while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. However, we were encouraged by the repair business improving sequentially over the prior periods with a lower year-over-year rate of decline compared to the second and the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points, and profit grew $8 million at constant currency. A strong contribution from productivity was partially offset by the impact from lower volume. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable.
Overall, full year results on Slide 9 reflect solid performance with $52 million of adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency and 70 basis points of margin expansion despite organic sales being down 2.1%. The Service business was particularly resilient, growing adjusted operating profit at constant currency by $55 million and margin by 100 basis points, notwithstanding a slight decline in organic sales, as our focus on productivity initiatives continued to yield results with maintenance hours per unit down close to 6% versus 2019.
Despite the environment, we are pleased with the operational progress we made in New Equipment business. Operating profit was down $45 million at constant currency on 4% organic sales decline with decremental margins more or less in line with our contribution margins. We achieved the goal of 3% material cost savings in 2020, partially offsetting the headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in lower volume, the associated under-absorption of costs, field inefficiencies and higher bad debt expense. Cost-containment efforts were also a large contributor to profit growth. And full year adjusted SG&A expense was down close to $40 million versus prior year. 
At the same time, we maintained the investments in R&D and other strategic project at 1.6% of sales, which was about flat versus the prior year. Full year adjusted EPS was up 12.5% or $0.28 versus the prior year driven by $0.07 from strong operating performance and $0.15 from the progress we are making on reducing our adjusted tax rate, down 370 basis points to 30.4%.
Net interest was also favorable by $0.06, reflecting the benefit of $350 million of debt repayment and $500 million of refinancing during the year. This EPS performance is not only better than the outlook provided in October but also better than the pre-COVID outlook provided in February on our Investor Day and caps a successful first year as a public company.
As we look forward to 2021 on Slide 10, we feel confident of growth across all key metrics given the higher starting New Equipment backlog, resiliency of the maintenance business in 2020, normalizing job site and building access levels and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement. Even though the rate of improvement slowed in Q4 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, we do expect year-over-year compares to turn favorable in the second quarter of 2021.
These encouraging trends, combined with the strong foundation we built in 2020, gives us confidence to grow overall organic sales by 2% to 4% with adjusted operating profit by $125 million to $175 million, with 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion. We expect sales, operating profit and margins to improve in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.67 to $2.77, up 8% or $0.20 at the midpoint. This year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit outlook and a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5%, partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest cost from the full year impact of debt placed at spin.
We expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with conversion at approximately 120% of GAAP net income. This reflects the strong earnings growth outlook, partially offset by incremental interest and nonrecurring tax-related payments in 2021. 
Given our strong working capital performance in 2020, a reduction of more than $90 million or close to 25% from 2019 year-end balances, we are holding working capital flat in 2021 at the midpoint of our outlook. Our capital deployment plans remain on track, and we have completed a previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment with a $150 million payment in January and expect share repurchases of $300 million in 2021, a year ahead of the original schedule at spin.
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 11. The New Equipment business is projected to be up between 2% to 5% driven by accelerated conversion of the backlog that was up 2% in 2020 and the expected return to growth in the market. We expect broad-based recovery with all 3 regions returning to growth in 2021: Americas up low to mid-single digits, EMEA up low single digits and Asia up mid-single digits driven by growth in China. 
In the Service segment, we expect maintenance and repair sales to be up 2% to 4% with maintenance sales growing from a stable base and recovery in discretionary repairs that will accelerate post Q1. Modernization sales should be up low to mid-single digits with Asia Pacific maintaining the growth momentum from an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by the regulatory requirements and other regions returning to growth as they convert the higher year-end backlog. Overall, the sales growth of 2% to 4% represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020 with growth across all regions and all lines of business.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 12. We expect operating profit to be up $125 million to $175 million and up $75 million to $125 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefit of volumes returning to pre-COVID levels and continued strong contribution from material and service productivity, to offset the headwinds from pricing in the New Equipment market, increases in commodity prices, step-up in maintenance expenses and incremental stand-alone costs in the first half of the year.

Jeff, so we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021 with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020, and we are projecting to continue this momentum into '21. So if you look at the New Equipment segment, there's a couple of driver",307,"Sure. Jeff, so we've seen earnings momentum going into 2021 with earnings up close to $50 million in the second half of 2020, and we are projecting to continue this momentum into '21. So if you look at the New Equipment segment, there's a couple of drivers that are driving the growth in '21 on the earnings side. The biggest piece of that is the segment returns to growth in '21 after a challenging 2020 with 3.5% organic sales growth at the midpoint, and the drop-through we'll get from that is a strong contributor to earnings growth. 
Along with strong material productivity, we still think we can deliver the 3% material cost productivity after absorbing the impact from commodity headwinds. And this, along with the restructuring actions that we took last year, will help us offset the incremental stand-alone cost, headwind from some of the actions that we took, some of the short-term actions that we took last year to protect the earnings and any adverse pricing that may materialize. I mean the pricing was more or less stable. I mean we were down slightly on the backlog, so we expect some headwinds of pricing, but we're obviously building that into our guidance. 
So the key here is that we are able to grow margins on the New Equipment side despite the commodity headwinds, increase in stand-alone costs, temporary costs coming back and the pricing pressures. This has been the key part of our strategy. We've been talking about it since our first earnings call back in April last year,that we understand the challenges we are facing, and we have these operational excellence programs that we're working on, whether it's backlog acceleration or material productivity to deal with anything that may arise. So we feel good about where we sit, Jeff -- sit here right now, Jeff."

Orders on any quarter basis aren't really the best determinant. They do go up and down. There's different levels in different regions, but we did have -- we do have -- we were down 3.5% at constant on the New Equipment side. I would point out, our modernization orders were up almost 5%.

It's really giving them that advanced look, that ability to be able to fix things remote and to really bring down our callbacks.
Our retention rate, we think that's really where you're going to see this in the retention rate. And our retention rate, we ended the year at 94%, which is industry-leading, and is up from earlier in the year when we were closer to 93%. So we're seeing it there. And then the reason we believe in it, we're going to be deploying at least that same number this year.

That will take some time to work its way through, obviously, the warranty period, a year or so in those places, but we believe in it.

So our commodity spend, Cai, is about -- total commodity spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right. You look at kind of what we are seeing right now for '21, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe high -- a little higher",382,"Yes. So our commodity spend, Cai, is about -- total commodity spend is about $300 million, out of which about 80% is steel. And you're right. You look at kind of what we are seeing right now for '21, steel is about 7% to 8%, maybe high -- a little higher in Q1 right now, and the fall was a little bit lower. So it averages it out to about 7% to 8%. 
So the way we're thinking about the commodity issue for next year is it was a tailwind in 2020. It's -- for '21, it is a headwind, given where the steel prices sit today. And the spreadsheet math would suggest, hey, that could be like a $20 million-plus headwind for us. But the other part that has simultaneously happened is that both euro and the renminbi have appreciated against the dollar, and we buy in local currency in both Europe and China. So we should be able to offset part of this commodity increase by just appreciation of the local currency. So that's one piece of it. 
The second piece is that we're working really, really hard on material productivity to offset the commodity headwinds. I think that's what Judy said earlier. And we're starting '21 in a much, much better position than we did in 2020 given the cadence that we gained last year. And a carryover benefit from the projects that we started midyear in 2020 is higher than where we were at this point last year. So we still think we can deliver 3% material productivity after absorbing the commodity headwinds and grow our New Equipment margins, which is what I said earlier in response to Jeff's question.
The other piece, to the extent the dollar weakness is causing the commodity headwinds, we're also seeing the $50 million FX gain on our earnings overall. So it's in a different line of the P&L, but some of the commodity weakness is because of appreciation of -- the depreciation of the dollar, but we gained that on the overall earnings side. So a little bit of a trade-off. But overall, it is an issue, but it's built into our guidance, and we feel we can get to 3% material productivity and grow our New Equipment margins in '21."

So let me start with cash, and then we can talk about the minority JV payment. So if you look at our cash, really strong year last year. We ended $150 million better than what we had guided, and net income came in better. Working capital was really, really good. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we reduced working capital by $90 million, which is 1/4 for working capital, which was a fantastic performance given what you hear overall.
And as we look at '21, the biggest driver is improvement in earnings, Julian, as you referenced. But there are 2 issues that we are trying to deal with next year. One is just the timing of the interest payments. So just the way where the interest payment is landed, we do have an extra interest payment in '21, which we did not have in 2020 given the timing of when we raised debt. The other issue is that we do need to make a tax-related payment for an old tax matter that we've inherited from UTC. So we built that into our guidance as well. That matter is still ongoing, but we've built that into our guidance.
Our -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we have not built any working capital improvement into our guidance at this point. We'll obviously keep working at the midpoint of our guidance because when we keep working, we'll keep working there hard. But our plan at this point doesn't contemplate that. $1.35 billion for '21 is a solid number. It's 120% of GAAP net income and substantially higher than where we expected '21 to be on Investor Day. So we think it's a solid start to the year.
On NCI for 2020, not any one single driver. It was a combination of various things, a couple of million here and there, and then FX was a little bit of a headwind as well. So I wouldn't read too much into where we ended on NCI for 2020."

Or if this is to kind of get back in line with where some of the market already is."

And we've increased our R&D investments 60% since 2015, and we've made -- actually, we've done really well. Our patents have gone up 4x since that same period, and our new product releases since 2018 are up 250%. So we've",485,"Yes, John. It's a little of both. And we've increased our R&D investments 60% since 2015, and we've made -- actually, we've done really well. Our patents have gone up 4x since that same period, and our new product releases since 2018 are up 250%. So we've made a conscious effort to really reinvigorate the innovation engine and the DNA in this company.
So some of that is a little bit of catch-up. But others like our Gen360 is going to be an incredibly new, digitally native with an electronic safety, first in the industry that code authorities have to approve. It's going to revolutionize really how people are gracefully handled when there's an issue in the elevator and the elevator has to actually stop. It's going to gracefully bring them down to an actual landing floor so that customers and, more importantly, passengers aren't entrapped at any length of time.
So our destination dispatch product is, we believe, is industry-leading. We've released the Compass 360 product that gives us even more capability, and we found customers are really very interested in that whole destination product because it's touch-free. And we've always talked about the safety of our products. Now we also talk about the health offerings of our products. And our team moved very rapidly during the COVID era to generate new products, whether it be gesture, whether it be our app -- our eCall app that allows you either via Bluetooth or other connectivity to use your phone. 
And then we've tried not just to hit the high end with the Gen360 in terms of complexity and features. We've also tried, as we talked about our Gen2 Prime, to find a nice, stable, affordable entrant that will be a workhorse for us in India, in the Middle East, in Africa, in other emerging markets. So we're trying to hit that whole span.
On the Service side, when we rolled out Otis ONE, we made a conscious decision to roll it out as a productivity enabler first. And we think we're going to drive 1 point of productivity with Otis ONE, and we're going to keep adding units to do that. The reason we did that and the strategy we did that, that we took was a density-based approach. There's not value -- as much value if you just sprinkle sensors or IoT units across the globe. So we did a very focused, density-based, route-based attempt and focus to be able to actually yield that productivity. And that will grow in productivity but it will also grow in terms of customer value and retention for us, and it provides a foundation for us to add services. 
So a little bit of catch-up, no argument, based on some prior year's lack of investments pre 2015. But I think we've really accelerated, both in the mechanical, the digital, the electronic and, most importantly, the passenger experience."

And I think that's what we've said before. So that's where we are. 
The comment on awards, which typically precede orders by a couple of months, and they were stable in the quarter, that was a North America comment. 
But if you look at Americas overall, John, I think the markets are kind of uncertain, right? I mean we've seen, as Judy mentioned in her prepared remarks, we've seen good growth in Asia. We now kind of feel good about the mid-single-digit growth there. If you look at EMEA, we feel good about the low single digit. Americas remains challenging, and the market was down mid-teens last year. So obviously, we did better than the market.
And if you look at the Dodge Momentum Index, that just turned strongly positive in December for the first time in several months. So that's an initial sign of recovery since COVID. But if you look at the Architecture Billings Index, that's still under 50, but now the inquiries have been positive for 4 months straight, so kind of mixed signals. And if you look at the range of guidance that we are giving, that -- part of that range is driven by the Americas growth outlook. So that's a contributor to that.
But overall, again, I think we discussed with Nigel earlier, we feel good about all the steps that we've taken in terms of improving our sales coverage, kind of 7 points in China, 10 points overall, new product introductions. Our proposals were up 7% last year. So that, obviously, is another good sign that we can keep building on this momentum that we have and the share gain that we've enjoyed, we can keep building on that. But Americas market is uncertain but that's what we built into our guidance."

So we saw a nice conversion, and our retention rate went up in China as well, as did our recapture rate on units we wanted to get back. So all 3 metrics that help drive net recovery for us in China were positive.
And we think that -- that's the strategy playing out. Everything we've told you about enhanced customer stickiness, IoT, more key accounts, which have higher conversion rates, closer to the 80% range, more infrastructure, which also has higher conversion rates.

Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well.
I'm pleased to share that Otis had an outstanding first quarter, demonstrating the power of our strategy, the global execution strength of our company and the capability of all our colleagues. Our New Equipment business was robust, and we gained close to 2 points of New Equipment share with orders up high-teens globally in a market that was up mid-teens.
In Korea, Otis was selected to provide approximately 170 elevators, escalators and moving walkways to support the fourth phase of the Incheon International Airport project. This addition will expand Otis' presence at the airport to over 650 units.
In China, we continue to support key infrastructure projects throughout the country, including in Xiong'an New Area, a new metropolis being built near Beijing. More than 1,000 Otis elevators and escalators have already been ordered in support of projects in the area that will be a new home to administrative services and residential communities being relocated from Beijing.
In Munich, we're continuing an over 35-year relationship with [indiscernible]. We have been selected to install 92 escalators for the Munich Metro's modernization project, bringing the total number of Otis escalators provided to the metro system to over 500 units. Using custom-made controllers, these escalators will seamlessly integrate with the [indiscernible] mobility app to provide passengers and maintenance crews with real-time data on escalator operational status.
And finally, in New York City, we received an order to modernize 3 Times Square, the Thomson Reuters building. We'll provide new controls, drives and Compass 360 destination dispatching on several units. This extends our long-term relationship with the building. We installed the original equipment nearly 20 years ago, and have been providing maintenance services ever since.
Our high-margin recurring service business also grew in all lines of business including modernization, while achieving adjusted operating profit margins of 22.6%. Our strategy is based on our Service model, which drove approximately 80% of our profit. This is the model that proves our resilience year after year, including during COVID. The global Service market grows faster than the global New Equipment market, and pricing tends to be more consistent in service.
Data and technology-based innovations help us attract and retain customers. And in Q1, we continued to deploy Otis ONE units in the field and are shipping IoT-enabled units in both China and North America.
We drove profit growth in both segments, largely from the drop-through benefit of higher volume, with organic growth in both segments and continued benefits from our material and service productivity initiatives.
Our strong performance allows us to create more value for our shareholders. In January, we completed the remaining $150 million of debt repayment we had committed to ahead of schedule. And just last week, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we're now in a position to increase our planned share repurchases for the year to $0.5 billion after completing $300 million in the first quarter.
And we're equally dedicated to delivering on our commitments as a global corporate citizen. In March, we share additional details with you on our important ESG initiatives, including becoming a signatory of the UN Global Compact, and we continue to make progress towards our goals. Our ESG programs are integral bringing our vision to life.
This month, we completed the inaugural year of made-to-move communities, our signature global corporate social responsibility initiative. This pioneering program focuses on 2 principal goals: advancing STEM education and supporting young innovators in the development of inclusive mobility solutions for underrepresented communities.
Students from around the world with their knowledge and skills to work alongside Otis mentors to come up with many creative solutions. The winners were announced in April. We look forward to extending this program geographically and to more students and mentors in the coming years.
Turning to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2021 outlook. First quarter new equipment orders were up high teens at constant currency, with mid-teens growth in the Americas, low single-digit growth in EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia, driven by China. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were up 1.4%. This stronger performance led to continued growth in New Equipment backlog of 8% and 2% at constant currency versus the prior year.
Organic sales were up 10.3% in the first quarter, with 25.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 1.3% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $83 million and margin expanded 40 basis points. Overall margin expansion was impacted by segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Free cash flow was robust at $541 million, with 176% conversion of GAAP net income.
I'm encouraged by this positive momentum, and we're confident in our revised 2021 outlook improving across all key metrics. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% versus prior year and up 4% to 6% organically. This is a 2-point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by faster-than-expected recovery in the New Equipment segment.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $170 million to $210 million of actual currency and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, with adjusted EPS in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, a 10% to 13% increase versus the prior year and a $0.09 improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with approximately 120% conversion of GAAP net income.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q1 results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 14.9% to $3.4 billion, with organic sales up 10.3% as the growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service returns to growth in the quarter.",1252,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 14.9% to $3.4 billion, with organic sales up 10.3% as the growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service returns to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 18% or $83 million and up $57 million at constant currency as the drop-through in higher volume, strong material and service productivity and favorable service pricing more than offset the headwinds from New Equipment mix and pricing as well as incremental public company expenses.
We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was down 20 basis points despite the step-up in public company expenses. And R&D spend and other strategic investments were about flat versus prior year. This strong focus on execution drove 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.
First quarter adjusted EPS was up 20% or $0.12, driven by $0.13 of operating profit growth and $0.05 from a lower adjusted tax rate. This was partially offset by incremental interest cost from the full quarter impact of our external debt.
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 18.4% at constant currency with growth in all regions. Orders rebounded strongly in Americas, up mid-teens and were up for the fourth straight quarter in Asia, including strength in China, where the orders were up double digits. Booked margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year but improved sequentially. Organic sales were up 25.1%, with Americas and Asia up about 22% and 46%, respectively, driven by strong backlog execution. EMEA was up low single digits, sustaining the turnaround that started in Q4 of 2020.
Despite the strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog, that was up 8% and up 2% at constant currency, with backlog margin down slightly versus prior year and up 20 basis points sequentially from prior quarter. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $44 million, and margin expanded 170 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity that met our 3% target more than offset the impact of unfavorable mix and pricing.
Service segment results on Slide 7. The number of units under maintenance contract increased by 2%, with growth in all regions and China up low teens after high single-digit growth in 2020 from strong improvement in underlying operational metrics. Modernization orders were up slightly at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by successful go-to-market strategy, to leverage the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets and low single-digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by lower order intake in EMEA. 
Service organic sales were up 1.3% in the first quarter, with continued resiliency of the contractual maintenance business and discretionary repair and modernization sales returning to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 basis points, and profit grew $35 million from the benefit of higher volume, strong contribution from productivity initiatives and favorable pricing. Translational FX benefit of $20 million was mostly offset by higher SG&A, including incremental public company expenses.
As we look forward to the remainder of 2021, on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given the higher backlog, strength of the maintenance business and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement and contributed to the growth of the repair business in the first quarter after 3 quarters of year-over-year decline. These encouraging trends, combined with the strong Q1 results, gives us confidence to raise the organic sales outlook to be up 4% to 6% for the year, up 2 points versus prior outlook driven by accelerated recovery in the New Equipment business.
We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $175 million to $215 million at actual currency, up $45 million from prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, $0.09 higher than prior outlook and up 12% versus prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5% and reduced share count.
This EPS outlook is ahead of the high single-digit medium-term growth target that we had provided at Investor Day. Following the strong cash generation in Q1 from higher net income and more than $300 million reduction in working capital, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, $50 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, reflecting the improvement in net income and better working capital performance. Given the strong Q1 free cash flow and success in repatriation of foreign cash, we raised our dividend 20% last week and are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $500 million. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The new equipment business is projected to be up between 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the market. This 4.5% improvement at the midpoint is driven by increased expectations in all regions and is supported by strong order intake in Q1 and demand signals from the market. Americas is now expected to be up high single digits, EMEA up low to mid-single digits and Asia up approximately 10% from improved outlook in China, and other markets in Asia Pacific returning to growth.
Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect service sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance and repair sales up 2% to 4% as well and modernization sales up low to mid-single digits, as maintenance remains resilient and we see continued recovery in the repair and modernization businesses.
In addition to our success in Asia Pacific, modernization growth is also driven by market growth in China and conversion of backlog in the Americas and EMEA. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 5% at the midpoint represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020, with growth across all regions and all lines of business and puts us above 2019 levels in both segments on a reported basis.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up $175 million to $215 million and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefits of higher volume, service and material productivity initiatives and favorable service pricing environment, partially offset by unfavorable mix and pricing in the New Equipment segment, headwinds from commodities and incremental stand-alone expenses. This represents a $45 million increase versus prior expectations, driven by the improvement of outlook in both segments, lower corporate expenses and higher translational FX benefit.
New Equipment margins at the midpoint are now expected to be up 80 basis points for the year versus prior expectations of 50 basis points and above 2019 levels. Service margins are now expected to be up 40 basis points from 30 basis points previously, building on the 110 basis point improvement in 2020. We expect overall margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points for the year.
Overall, we believe that this strong outlook for the business on sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation reflects our focus on execution and the benefits of a solid market recovery.
And with that, I will request Stephane to please open the line for questions."

We're seeing that -- we're experiencing that in Americas.
Our New Equipment organic sales were up almost 22%, and our orders were up over 14%. We're seeing that across the volume business as well as in some major projects. So there continues to be recovery, especially in North America. Brazil is still suffering some of the COVID impacts. But North America, between the U.S. and Canada, is back very strong, again, a volume-type business as well as major projects.
In terms of verticals, the commercial business, that commercial nonres in North America turned positive for us this quarter, and actually did a little better than residential for us in North America. So it was a little different than we saw in 2019. But again, with the indicators and the indices heading in the right direction and this really strong performance by our Americas team, we had growth in New Equipment orders significant, but we also had growth in moderates in the Americas. So the team is executing well in local markets and then as well on national accounts."

And the other point, just to go back to your question on large orders, if you look at the mega orders, which is like define those as 10 million above, that's less than 10% of our volume in any given quarter. While those were up in the quarter, we saw really strong double-digit plus increase in the ongoing volume business as well.

The other 2 places we saw improvements were in our key accounts and in the Infrastructure segment. They had the 2 largest areas of growth for us in the 1Q in China. And that's important on the New Equipment side, but for us, it's even more important because our conversion rates for key accounts and infrastructure allow us to grow our service portfolio. Our service portfolio grew in the low teens in China in the quarter, which beat the high single digits from last year. So Tier 1 and 2 positive, more positive than we saw in 2020."

Second half is going to be a little tougher compare for us in China because China came back so quickly post-COVID in the second half of '20. So we're going to watch all those factors, but the segment in China, the New Equipment segment, is going to grow mid-single digits.

But as we look forward to Q2, China recovered strongly and was up high single digits last year. But the rest of the world was still weak. So we expect New Equipment will still be strong in the second quarter, but maybe not as strong as Q1. So that's where we think. Then Q3 should be up as well, and then compares us in Q4 because Americas and the EMEA market recovered very strongly last year.
So on the Service side, the flip side is true because we got out of the gate marginally stronger than we had expected, with the recovery of the repair business. But the impact to that full year is marginal. And so we didn't change the guide there. But the fact is that we do expect Service to be up really strongly in Q2, just given the year-over-year compares were weak last year.

We expect modernization to pick up. I was pleased to see modernization up in terms of orders. We were up this quarter, and we saw a nice turn there.

As you said previously, we focused on taking cost out of the business. And even on the field side, we are focusing on reducing the number of installation hours. So that's been our focus, and that's where you saw a substantial improvement in the margins in the New Equipment segment.
The positive that we did see was that both the backlog and the book margins improved versus Q4. And that's a positive sign because if this improvement holds through the year, that should be positive for 2022.

Pricing is very competitive globally, but there are certain markets where we believe we can have some targeted pricing increase to offset that additional $15 million to $20 million of headwinds in a few countries not to be named, but where we think that price will come through and we'll be able to offset that."

So that's a good sign.
And also, if you look at the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our drop-through on the higher volume at constant FX is close to 20%, so good, which is above our contribution margin of 18%. So clearly, the fact is we're getting the benefit from volume and even a little bit from productivity that we are able to see in the 20% drop-through for the remaining 3 quarters of the year."

The savings that we're getting from restructuring actions that we've taken in 2020, that will help us offset the incremental standalone cost and headwind from some of the actions that we took last year.
So -- and we raised the New Equipment earnings outlook, primarily from the higher revenue. But based on the drop-through again, just to repeat what we said earlier, but based on the drop-through on incremental volume for the year is close to 20%. So we are seeing and it's -- so I don't -- it's just the fact is we are seeing the drop when you see about 30% -- $30 million improvement in earnings. So it's early in the year.

So that is where -- but it's good to see, Julian, despite that, I mean, if you look at our profit guide, even for balance of the year, we're expecting close to $40 million improvement in our New Equipment earnings. So we're absorbing that. You're seeing the benefit from volume. So we see continued improvement on the New Equipment profitability.
The margins are higher in the second half. I mean based on the guide that we provided, our margins for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, up 50 basis points year-over-year. So not only we saw very strong margin expansion in the first quarter, given the volume increase, but even as we go through the rest of the year, second half compares do get tougher just given the strong growth that we had in New Equipment segment, especially in the fourth quarter.

We're going to continue to monitor this. And obviously, we'll be back to you next quarter with what we know. We do expect the second half service growth to be stronger.

So that was another part because it's less than $5 million for the quarter, so it's insignificant. So that was another really positive development. And as Judy said, the pricing -- overall service pricing was favorable. And that is where you saw us increase the guide.
But that part, the concession, just given the overall COVID environment, that part, we have been very careful right now just because we're not through COVID, especially if you see certain parts of the world, we're seeing some resurgence. So that part, we baked in some improvement in Service pricing. We reflected that in our guide, but we were careful not to bake in the sequential reduction of Service concessions in our outlook, just given the uncertainty in the environment.

So the difference between 2021 and maybe some of the prior years is the COVID impact. So this year is a little bit different than the prior years.
Just given the slowdown in China in Q1 of last year. So we expected and China rebounded very strongly in Q2 of 2020 just because it was a snapback. So that is where you see. The historical trends that you mentioned, they're primarily driven by the Chinese New Year holiday. So Q1 is typically a lighter quarter in China. And then you see an improvement in Q2. So that's what a typical year is. But last year, that trend got magnified because of COVID. So therefore, we saw a really strong snapback in Q1 of this year. 
And I think the improvement in China, well, we're still going to see the sequential improvement in China that we always do, but it's not going to be to the same extent. I think that's what -- in response to Jeff's question, I think that's what I was trying to say earlier.
So that's what you will see. So this year, the trends are going to look a little bit different than the prior year trends, just given that. So we expect Q2 to be strong. We expect Q2 New Equipment sales to still be up strongly, just given Americas and EMEA compares. And again, as we said earlier, the Service compares should be easy as well. So we expect a snapback in Service. Compares are easy, our repair and modernization revenues coming back. And the snapback of the repair revenue in Q1, that was a positive that we have not seen that year-over-year growth in the repair revenue since Q1 of 2020. So that was a positive, and we expect that trend to accelerate in Q2 of 2020 -- Q2 of 2021. So that's the positive that we see.

So China was up, EMEA was up, Americas was up and the majority of Asia Pacific was up, with the exception of one kind of mature country. So those results really stand tall. It's important for us that, that happens in first quarter because that's when so many of the maintenance contracts get resigned. That's -- if we have a sense of seasonality, that's where it happens. So that's why that was so important for us. In terms of portfolio in China, we are taking it away from the IS piece. There's no doubt now with the pace and the rate that we're securing that portfolio growth in China, that's exactly who we're taking it away from. And we've shared our strategy where we've expanded Service depots. We've added our reach in the Tier 5 and on cities, and it's paying off.
And so again, double-digit teens in China in the first quarter, and they just have sequentially now for the past 3 or 4 quarters, continue to improve their portfolio attachment rate. Everywhere else, In terms of portfolio, we had EMEA had good growth. We had growth in the Americas. And again, the Asia growth was more driven by China."

Thank you for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. 
I'm pleased to share that Otis had an outstanding first quarter, demonstrating the power of our strategy, the global execution strength of our company and the capability of all our colleagues. Our New Equipment business was robust, and we gained close to 2 points of New Equipment share, with orders up high-teens globally in a market that was up mid-teens. 
In Korea, Otis was selected to provide approximately 170 elevators, escalators and moving walkways to support the fourth phase of the Incheon International Airport project. This addition will expand Otis' presence at the airport to over 650 units. 
In China, we continue to support key infrastructure projects throughout the country, including in Xiong'an New Area, a new metropolis being built near Beijing. More than 1,000 Otis elevators and escalators have already been ordered in support of projects in the area that will be a new home to administrative services and residential communities being relocated from Beijing. 
In Munich, we're continuing an over 35-year relationship with Stadtwerke München. We have been selected to install 92 escalators for the Munich metro's modernization project, bringing the total number of Otis escalators provided to the metro system to over 500 units. Using custom-made controllers, these escalators will seamlessly integrate with the Stadtwerke mobility app to provide passengers and maintenance crews with real-time data on escalator operational status. 
And finally, in New York City, we received an order to modernize 3 Times Square, the Thomson Reuters building. We'll provide new controls, drives and Compass 360 destination dispatching on several units. This extends our long-term relationship with the building. We installed the original equipment nearly 20 years ago and have been providing maintenance services ever since. 
Our high-margin recurring Service business also grew in all lines of business, including modernization, while achieving adjusted operating profit margins of 22.6%. Our strategy is based on our Service model, which drives approximately 80% of our profit. This is the model that proves our resilience year after year, including during COVID. The global Service market grows faster than the global New Equipment market, and pricing tends to be more consistent in Service. 
Data and technology-based innovations help us attract and retain customers. And in Q1, we continued to deploy Otis ONE units in the field and are shipping IoT-enabled units in both China and North America. We drove profit growth in both segments, largely from the drop-through benefit of higher volume, with organic growth in both segments and continued benefits from our material and service productivity initiatives. 
Our strong performance allows us to create more value for our shareholders. In January, we completed the remaining $150 million of debt repayment we had committed to ahead of schedule. And just last week, we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we're now in a position to increase our planned share repurchases for the year to $0.5 billion after completing $300 million in the first quarter. 
And we're equally dedicated to delivering on our commitments as a global corporate citizen. In March, we shared additional details with you on our important ESG initiatives, including becoming a signatory of the UN Global Compact, and we continue to make progress towards our goals. Our ESG programs are integral bringing our vision to life. 
This month, we completed the inaugural year of Made to Move Communities, our signature global corporate social responsibility initiative. This pioneering program focuses on 2 principal goals: advancing STEM education and supporting young innovators in the development of inclusive mobility solutions for underrepresented communities. 
Students from around the world put their knowledge and skills to work alongside Otis mentors to come up with many creative solutions. The winners were announced in April. We look forward to extending this program geographically and to more students and mentors in the coming years. 
Turning to Slide 4, Q1 results and 2021 outlook. First quarter New Equipment orders were up high teens at constant currency, with mid-teens growth in the Americas, low single-digit growth in EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia, driven by China. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were up 1.4%. This strong order performance led to continued growth in New Equipment backlog of 8% and 2% at constant currency versus the prior year. 
Organic sales were up 10.3% in the first quarter, with 25.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 1.3% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $83 million and margin expanded 40 basis points. Overall margin expansion was impacted by segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Free cash flow was robust at $541 million, with 176% conversion of GAAP net income. 
I'm encouraged by this positive momentum, and we're confident in our revised 2021 outlook improving across all key metrics. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% versus prior year and up 4% to 6% organically. This is a 2-point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint, driven by faster-than-expected recovery in the New Equipment segment. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $170 million to $210 million of actual currency and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, with adjusted EPS in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, a 10% to 13% increase versus the prior year and a $0.09 improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with approximately 120% conversion of GAAP net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q1 results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 14.9% to $3.4 billion, with organic sales up 10.3% as the growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service returns to growth in the quarter.",1252,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with first quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 14.9% to $3.4 billion, with organic sales up 10.3% as the growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service returns to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 18% or $83 million and up $57 million at constant currency as the drop-through in higher volume, strong material and service productivity and favorable Service pricing more than offset the headwinds from New Equipment mix and pricing as well as incremental public company expenses. 
We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was down 20 basis points despite the step-up in public company expenses. And R&D spend and other strategic investments were about flat versus prior year. This strong focus on execution drove 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. 
First quarter adjusted EPS was up 20% or $0.12, driven by $0.13 of operating profit growth and $0.05 from a lower adjusted tax rate. This was partially offset by incremental interest cost from the full quarter impact of our external debt. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 18.4% at constant currency, with growth in all regions. Orders rebounded strongly in Americas, up mid-teens, and were up for the fourth straight quarter in Asia, including strength in China, where the orders were up double digits. 
Booked margin in the quarter was down 60 basis points year-over-year, but improved sequentially. Organic sales were up 25.1%, with Americas and Asia up about 22% and 46%, respectively, driven by strong backlog execution. EMEA was up low single digits, sustaining the turnaround that started in Q4 of 2020. 
Despite the strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog that was up 8% and up 2% at constant currency, with backlog margin down slightly versus prior year and up 20 basis points sequentially from prior quarter. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $44 million, and margin expanded 170 basis points as higher volume and strong material productivity that met our 3% target more than offset the impact of unfavorable mix and pricing. 
Service segment results on Slide 7. The number of units under maintenance contract increased by 2%, with growth in all regions and China up low teens after high single-digit growth in 2020 from strong improvement in underlying operational metrics. Modernization orders were up slightly at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by successful go-to-market strategy to leverage the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets, and low single-digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by lower order intake in EMEA. 
Service organic sales were up 1.3% in the first quarter, with continued resiliency of the contractual maintenance business and discretionary repair and modernization sales returning to growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 basis points, and profit grew $35 million from the benefit of higher volume, strong contribution from productivity initiatives and favorable pricing. Translational FX benefit of $20 million was mostly offset by higher SG&A, including incremental public company expenses. 
As we look forward to the remainder of 2021, on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given the higher backlog, strength of the maintenance business and our focus on operational excellence. Service callbacks, our proxy for repair volume, is also showing continued sequential improvement and contributed to the growth of the repair business in the first quarter after 3 quarters of year-over-year decline. 
These encouraging trends, combined with the strong Q1 results, gives us confidence to raise the organic sales outlook to be up 4% to 6% for the year, up 2 points versus prior outlook, driven by accelerated recovery in the New Equipment business. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $175 million to $215 million at actual currency, up $45 million from prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.78 to $2.84, $0.09 higher than prior outlook and up 12% versus prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 90 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate to 29.5%, and reduced share count. This EPS outlook is ahead of the high single-digit medium-term growth target that we had provided at Investor Day. 
Following the strong cash generation in Q1 from higher net income and more than $300 million reduction in working capital, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, $50 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, reflecting the improvement in net income and better working capital performance. Given the strong Q1 free cash flow and success in repatriation of foreign cash, we raised our dividend 20% last week and are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $500 million. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The New Equipment business is projected to be up between 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the market. This 4.5% improvement at the midpoint is driven by increased expectations in all regions and is supported by strong order intake in Q1 and demand signals from the market. 
Americas is now expected to be up high single digits, EMEA up low to mid-single digits and Asia up approximately 10% from improved outlook in China and other markets in Asia Pacific returning to growth. Consistent with our prior outlook, we expect Service sales to be up 2% to 4%, with maintenance and repair sales up 2% to 4% as well, and modernization sales up low to mid-single digits as maintenance remains resilient, and we see continued recovery in the repair and modernization businesses. 
In addition to our success in Asia Pacific, modernization growth is also driven by market growth in China and conversion of backlog in the Americas and EMEA. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 5% at the midpoint represents a solid turnaround after a difficult 2020, with growth across all regions and all lines of business and puts us above 2019 levels in both segments on a reported basis. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up $175 million to $215 million and up $120 million to $160 million at constant currency, reflecting the benefits of higher volume, service and material productivity initiatives and favorable Service pricing environment, partially offset by unfavorable mix and pricing in the New Equipment segment, headwinds from commodities and incremental stand-alone expenses. This represents a $45 million increase versus prior expectations, driven by the improvement of outlook in both segments, lower corporate expenses and higher translational FX benefit. 
New Equipment margins at the midpoint are now expected to be up 80 basis points for the year versus prior expectations of 50 basis points and above 2019 levels. Service margins are now expected to be up 40 basis points from 30 basis points previously, building on the 110 basis point improvement in 2020. We expect overall margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points for the year. 
Overall, we believe that this strong outlook for the business on sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation reflects our focus on execution and the benefits of a solid market recovery. And with that, I will request Stephanie to please open the line for questions."

I think we're seeing all the indicators now starting to turn, whether that's the ABI, the Architect's Billing Index (sic) [ Architecture Billings Index ], which is, in March, was at a record since the 2007 time frame. The Dodge momentum has turned positive as well. We're seeing that -- we're experiencing that in Americas.
Our New Equipment organic sales were up almost 22%, and our orders were up over 14%. We're seeing that across the volume business as well as in some major projects. So there continues to be recovery, especially in North America. Brazil is still suffering some of the COVID impacts. But North America, between the U.S. and Canada, is back very strong, again, a volume-type business as well as major projects.
In terms of verticals, the commercial business, that commercial nonres in North America, turned positive for us this quarter and actually did a little better than residential for us in North America. So it was a little different than we saw in 2019. But again, with the indicators and the indices heading in the right direction and this really strong performance by our Americas team, we had growth in New Equipment orders, significant. But we also had growth in mod orders in the Americas. So the team is executing well in local markets and then as well on national accounts."

And with those things not being as much of an issue in Q1, we saw really good field execution in the Americas specifically. So that is where you saw the America sales being up. 
And the other point, just to go back to your question on large orders, if you look at the mega orders, which is like we define those as $10 million above, that's less than 10% of our volume in any given quarter. While those were up in the quarter, we saw really strong double-digit plus increase in the ongoing volume business as well. So it was a good performance across both the megaproject and the volume business."

The other 2 places we saw improvements were in our key accounts and in the infrastructure segment. They had the 2 largest areas of growth for us in the first Q in China. And that's important on the New Equipment side, but for us, it's even more important because our conversion rates for key accounts and infrastructure allow us to grow our Service portfolio. And our Service portfolio grew in the low teens in China in the quarter, which beat the high single digits from last year. So Tier 1 and 2 positive, more positive than we saw in 2020."

Second half is going to be a little tougher compare for us in China because China came back so quickly post-COVID in the second half of '20. So we're going to watch all those factors. But the segment in China, the New Equipment segment, is going to grow mid-single digits. It's the largest market in the world, even despite some of the cooling measures that are still in place.

So we expect New Equipment will still be strong in the second quarter, but maybe not as strong as Q1. So that's where we think of, then Q3 should be up as well. And then compares get tough in Q4 because Americas and the EMEA market recovered really strongly last year.
So on the Service side, the flip side is true because we got out of the gate marginally stronger than we had expected, with the recovery of the repair business. But the impact to that full year is marginal. And so we didn't change the guide there. But the fact is that we do expect Service to be up really strongly in Q2, just given the year-over-year compares were weak last year.

There is -- when someone is ready to make an investment with one of these developers, usually, it's not the developer, though, it's more the building owner now or the building manager, or the condominium association that are looking for these upgrades than the original developer. And so our sales force is very focused on that.
We expect modernization to pick up. I was pleased to see modernization up in terms of orders. We were up this quarter, and we saw a nice turn there. And we're going to see that pick up, especially in EMEA. Our Europe performance -- and we don't talk a lot about this because the Americas and China was so strong, but our Europe -- our EMEA performance for New Equipment sales were up over 3%, orders were up over 3%, and they had really good portfolio growth. 
But we see there's a pent-up demand, especially in EMEA, for modernization because these customers really couldn't get to us or couldn't meet to approve mod. So whether it's health solutions, where we get integrated, or standard modernization for technology, for aesthetics, or for connections with Otis ONE or our eView product, we're expecting that to pick up, especially in the second half of the year."

So very pleased with the product reception. It's at a great price point, entry-level point for us. And I think we're going to see that continue to make a difference for us, addressing what was an area where we needed a product to bring to market. And that's where we are as an innovator."

And as we said in our prepared remarks, there was headwinds from both mix and pricing. But the pricing pressure was really no surprise. I mean, we've been talking about it, given the macro environment, we did expect pricing environment to be challenges.
But we -- as we said previously, we focused on taking cost out of the business. And even on the field side, we are focusing on reducing the number of installation hours. So that's been our focus, and that's where you saw a substantial improvement in the margins in the New Equipment segment.
The positive that we did see was that both the backlog and the book margins improved versus Q4. And that's a positive sign because if this improvement holds through the year, that should be positive for 2022. And this is different than the trends, especially on the backlog margin, this improvement in -- sequential improvement is different than the trends that we were seeing last year. So that is a positive development. And if it holds, that should be a positive for 2022."

You're seeing the drop-through and you're seeing the margin expansion offsetting competitive pricing. We have always said we will control what we can control. We can't really predict market-driven pricing, but we will control what we can. 
And so when we started the year, and in our fourth quarter and in our first guide, we said we had accounted in our guide for about $20 million of commodity headwinds. We're seeing about $15 million to $20 million higher than that original thought -- than what we originally built into the guide. So we're doing a few things about that. We're driving material productivity even more, again, 3% in the -- a little over 3% in the first quarter, net of inflation. Our New Equipment margins are rising.
We're also targeting some pricing. Pricing is very competitive globally. But there are certain markets where we believe we can have some targeted pricing increase to offset that additional $15 million to $20 million of headwinds in a few countries, not to be named, but where we think that price will come through, and we'll be able to offset that."

And also, if you look at the remaining 3 quarters of the year, our drop-through on the higher volume at constant FX is close to 20%, so good, which is above our contribution margin of 18%.

The savings that we're getting from restructuring actions that we've taken in 2020, that will help us offset the incremental stand-alone cost and headwind from some of the actions that we took last year.
So -- and we've raised the New Equipment earnings outlook, primarily from the higher revenue. But based on the drop-through -- again, just to repeat what we said earlier, but based on the drop-through on incremental volume for the year is close to 20%. So we are seeing, and it's -- so I don't -- it's just, the fact is, we are seeing the drop when you see about 30% -- $30 million improvement in earnings. So it's early in the year.

So we are expecting that to continue throughout the year.
So that is where -- but it's good to see, Julian, despite that, I mean, if you look at our profit guide, even for balance of the year, we're expecting close to $40 million improvement in our New Equipment earnings. So we're absorbing that. You're seeing the benefit from volume. So we see continued improvement on the New Equipment profitability.
The margins are higher in the second half. I mean, based on the guide that we've provided, our margins for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, up 50 basis points year-over-year. So not only we saw very strong margin expansion in the first quarter, given the volume increase, but even as we go through the rest of the year, second half compares do get tougher just given the strong growth that we had in New Equipment segment, especially in the fourth quarter.

We're going to continue to monitor this. And obviously, we'll be back to you next quarter with what we know. We do expect the second half Service growth to be stronger.

So that was another part, because it's less than $5 million for the quarter, so it's insignificant. So that was another really positive development. And as Judy said, the pricing -- overall Service pricing was favorable. And that is where you saw us increase the guide.
But that part, the concessions, just given the overall COVID environment, that part we have been very careful right now just because we're not through COVID, and especially, if you see certain parts of the world, we're seeing some resurgence. So that part, we've baked in some improvement in Service pricing.

So the difference between 2021 and maybe some of the prior years is the COVID impact. So this year is a little bit different than the prior years, just given the slowdown in China in Q1 of last year. So we expected -- and China rebounded very strongly in Q2 of 2020 just because it was a snapback. So that is where you see. 
The historical trends that you mentioned, they're primarily driven by the Chinese New Year holiday. So Q1 is typically a lighter quarter in China. And then you see an improvement in Q2. So that's what a typical year is. But last year, that trend got magnified because of COVID. So therefore, we saw a really strong snapback in Q1 of this year. 
And I think the improvement in China -- well, we're still going to see that sequential improvement in China that we always do, but it's not going to be to the same extent. I think that's what -- in response to Jeff's question, I think that's what I was trying to say earlier. So that's what you will see. So this year, the trends are going to look a little bit different than the prior-year trends, just given that. 
So we expect Q2 to be strong. We expect Q2 New Equipment sales to be -- still be up strongly, just given Americas and EMEA compares. And again, as we said earlier, the Service compares should be easy as well. So we expect a snapback in Service. Compares are easy. Our repair and modernization revenue is coming back. 
And the snapback of the repair revenue in Q1, that was a positive, that we have not seen that year-over-year growth in the repair revenue in -- since Q1 of 2020. So that was a positive, and we expect that trend to accelerate in Q2 of 2020 -- Q2 of 2021. So that's the positive that we see.

So China was up, EMEA was up, Americas was up and the majority of Asia Pacific was up, with the exception of 1 kind of mature country. 
So those results really stand tall. It's important for us that, that happens in the first quarter because that's when so many of the maintenance contracts get resigned. That's -- if we have a sense of seasonality, that's where it happens. So that's why that was so important for us. 
In terms of portfolio in China, we are taking it away from the ISPs. There's no doubt now with the pace and the rate that we're securing that portfolio growth in China, that's exactly who we're taking it away from.

We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy."

Otis delivered an excellent second quarter, closing out a strong first half. This included mid-teens organic sales growth, demonstrating the resiliency of our colleagues in business and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Overall, demand in the new equipment segment was strong, we gained about 1 point of new equipment share with orders up approximately 24% in a market that was up low teens. New equipment orders grew in all regions and were particularly strong in the Americas up nearly 50% with an over 4x increase in major project bookings versus the prior year. These orders will support customer projects throughout North America. 
For example, in Canada, Otis secured an order to outfit a luxury high-rise condominium building in the M-City community with several elevators, including custom cab interiors that fit the building's upscale design. 
Moving to service. We grew sales in all lines of business, including repair and modernization. Modernization demand was strong, with orders up mid-teens versus the prior year. This includes another Otis partnership with Silverstein properties in the Americas, where we will modernize more than 40 elevators in the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, and integrate Compass 360 and Otis' eCall app to allow for more seamless customer and tenant access to the building services. 
The demonstrated strength of the maintenance business continued, and we achieved 3% growth year-over-year on our industry-leading service portfolio, a key goal we set for ourselves entering this year. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in both segments, largely from the benefit of higher volume as new equipment and service organic sales grew about 25% and 8%, respectively. 
Since spin, our consistent performance reflects the power of our strategy and its implementation. I hope many of you are able to join us for welcome to tomorrow, where we shared our Gen3 and Gen360 highly innovative platforms that meet the current and future needs of our customers in an increasingly connected world. Gen3 builds upon the proven flat belt technology of Otis' best-selling Gen2 platform, while adding built-in Otis ONE IoT connectivity and a variety of options, such as eCall, eView, Compass dispatching systems, health solutions and updated aesthetics. APIs allow us to access and leverage data with analytics that drive value for our customers. Upon release, Otis secured an order for more than 100 Gen3 elevators for a new residential project in the [indiscernible] province Northeast China. In EMEA, after successful pilots in several countries, Otis officially launched Gen360 a next-generation, digitally native platform that includes all the features of the Gen3 elevator built around an all new electronic architecture in a more compact design. Gen360 is enabled with IoT capabilities and online tools, a connected passenger experience and additional safety features to help limit entrapments and enable maintenance from inside the elevator cab. 
In France, Otis was selected to outfit a future aquatic center in the Paris suburbs with the Gen360 ecosystem. In addition to its many digital safety and passenger benefits,  this platform has a decisive advantage. For the first time, we can eliminate the need to accommodate hoistway projection onto the roof, avoiding interfering with the building's architectural lines, a feature desirable to architects and building owners. 
All of this strong first half performance, including robust free cash flow generation in excess of 150% of net income enables us to return additional cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we completed the previously planned $0.5 billion in share repurchases ahead of schedule and are now in a position to increase our 2021 target to $750 million. 
In parallel with the strong financial performance, we continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives that are integral to bringing our vision to life. In May, we released additional long-term ESG goals, aligning with our 4 ESG commitments: health and safety, people and communities, environment and impact and governance and accountability.  
During the quarter, we made progress on our goal to meet ISO 14001 certification standards in all of our factories. Otis' manufacturing facility in Brazil became the latest to achieve this certification, meaning nearly 90% of our factories are now ISO 14000-certified. This is part of our ongoing work to operate more sustainably. Initiatives in the factory include implementation of rain water and water reuse systems, LED lighting to reduce energy consumption by more than 2/3 and improvements to shipping and packaging materials to reduce waste by approximately 800 tonnes annually. 
In Paris, we introduced electric vehicles into our fleet, and we'll be expanding this pilot over the coming months. Early feedback from our field professionals has been positive, and the program will continue to contribute to our CO2 emission reduction targets. 
Moving to social. One year ago, in response to the urgent problems of social unrest and entrenched racism, we announced our commitment to change, a framework to ensure all colleagues feel safe, welcome and heard. While there's still work to be done, I'm proud of the process we've made on this initiative over the past year. Actions taken include engaging all supervisors worldwide in a training program designed to help them mitigate unconscious bias, increasing access to employee assistance and wellness programs globally, launching our Made to Move community signature STEM education program and awarding not-for-profit grants to communities in each region that support diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And in June, we began our second annual season of safety reinforcing Otis' strong safety culture, recommitting to our life-saving cardinal rules and prioritizing ongoing training on safety procedures and protocols.  We remain committed to a zero-harm workplace. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Second quarter results and 2021 outlook. In addition to record new equipment bookings in the second quarter, total Otis orders were up 9.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 15.4% in the second quarter with 25.4% organic growth in the new equipment segment and 7.8% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $115 million and margin expanded 40 basis points despite a 60 basis point impact from segment mix as the new equipment business grew faster than the higher-margin service business. 
Free cash flow was robust at $493 million, with 151% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum, our continued progress on our long-term strategy,  and the pace of recovery in our end markets, gives us confidence to improve our 2021 outlook across all key metrics. We now expect sales to be in the range of $14.1 billion to $14.2 billion, up 10.5% to 11% versus the prior year and up 7.5% to 8% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.16 billion to $2.18 billion, up $240 million to $260 million at actual currency and up $170 million to $190 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint versus the prior outlook and now expected to be in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, a 15% to 16% increase versus the prior year. 
Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion with about 120% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q2 results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 22.2% to $3.7 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in new equipment and service grew for the second consecutive quarter. Adjusted opera",1462,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 22.2% to $3.7 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in new equipment and service grew for the second consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 25% or $115 million and up $80 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments.  Favorable service pricing and productivity initiatives in both new equipment and service helped offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to absorb the impact from COVID-19. 
We maintained to focus on cost containment while continuing to invest in the business and adjusted SG&A was down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the step-up in public company expenses. R&D spend and other strategic investments were up approximately $8 million versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and a full point of margin expansion at constant segment mix. 
Second quarter adjusted EPS was up 41% or $0.23, driven primarily from $0.18 of operating profit growth and $0.06 from a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders were up 23.9% at constant currency, with growth in all regions. Orders momentum continued in the Americas and EMEA, up approximately 47% and 19%, respectively, as the markets recovered and the investments made by Otis continued to deliver. Orders in Asia were up approximately 17% and were up for the fifth consecutive quarter, including strength in China, where the orders were up mid-teens with record bookings during the quarter. Pricing was down 60 basis points, similar to the first quarter. Organic sales were up 25.4% with Americas and EMEA up mid-30s, driven by strong backlog execution as the business continues to progress towards pre-COVID levels. 
Asia was up mid-teens, driven by China, where organic sales were up double digits. Despite strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog that was up 10% and up 5% at constant currency, with backlog margin down about 0.5 point versus prior year, including any adverse product mix impact. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $64 million, primarily driven by higher volume.  The strong year-over-year improvement in installation execution and continued focus on material productivity helped to offset the unfavorable impact from price mix and commodity inflation. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 2 percentage points. 
Service segment results on Slide 7. Year-over-year growth in the number of units under maintenance contracts accelerated to 3%, reflecting strong global improvement in retention, recapture and conversion rates versus prior year. Number of units increased in all regions, and China was up mid-teens after a high single-digit growth in 2020. 
Modernization orders were strong in the quarter, up 16.8% at constant currency as North America and Europe grew double digits, a sharp rebound after a decline in 2020. Modernization backlog was up 4% at constant currency, providing a foundation for sales growth in the subsequent quarters. Service organic sales were up 7.8%, with growth in all lines of business. Growth accelerated in maintenance and repair to 7.5% from a strong recovery in repair with the contractual maintenance remaining resilient. 
Modernization sales were up 9.3%, from continued momentum in Asia Pacific and China and pickup of activity in EMEA. Adjusted operating profit grew $55 million from higher volume and improved pricing, including favorability from the absence of price concessions made last year. Translational FX benefit of $24 million was more than offset by incremental public company expenses and the snapback of COVID-related cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the sixth consecutive quarter and was up 10 basis points. 
Overall, the first half results reflect solid performance across all metrics, with 1.5 percentage points of new equipment share gain, 13% organic sales growth and close to $200 million of adjusted operating profit growth. First half new equipment and service organic sales were up 25.3% and 4.5%, respectively, with margin expansion in both segments. 
Free cash flow generation was robust at $1 billion, enabling us to raise dividends and complete our debt repayment and previously announced $500 million of share buyback. As we look forward to the second half of 2021 on Slide 8. The we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given higher backlog, growth momentum in all lines of business and our focus on operational excellence. This, combined with strengthening demand in our end markets and strong first half results, gives us confidence to raise organic sales outlook to be up 7.5% to 8% for the year, up 275 basis points versus prior outlook. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $240 million to $260 million, up from $55 million in the prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, $0.10 higher than prior outlook and up 15% versus the prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 140 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate that is now expected to be 29% for the year from 29.5% in the prior outlook and a reduced share count. 
Following the strong cash generation in the first half from net income growth and close to $300 million of reduction in working capital from the end of the year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion. This is $75 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, from improved net income and better working capital performance. Given the improved free cash flow outlook and the success in repatriation of foreign cash, we are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $750 million. In addition, we will continue our bolt-on M&A activities and are always open to other opportunistic investments that can create value for our customers and shareholders. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The new equipment business is projected to be up 12% to 13% from 7.5% to 8.5% previously, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the construction activity in several countries. This 450 basis point increase from prior outlook includes improved expectations in all regions. EMEA is now expected to be up high single digits. And we expect low teens growth in the Americas and Asia, driven by China. We are also improving our service outlook by 125 basis points at the midpoint, now expected to be up 4% to 4.5%. This reflects improvement in maintenance and repair that is now expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% from maintenance portfolio growth and stronger discretionary repair demand. 
Modernization business is now expected to be up mid-single digits, driven by higher Q2 ending backlog. Overall, the organic sales outlook of 7.5% to 8% reflects growth across all regions and all lines of business. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profits to be up $240 million to $260 million versus prior year, including FX tailwind of approximately $70 million from strengthening of the renminbi and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up $170 million to $190 million. Total company margin is projected to improve by 30 basis points. This outlook reflects the benefits of higher volume, service, material and installation productivity initiatives and favorable service pricing. It is partially offset by unfavorable new equipment price mix, headwinds from incremental stand-alone expenses and higher commodity prices. The commodity headwind for the year is now expected to be $70 million to $80 million for the year, approximately $35 million to $40 million higher than what we communicated in April as metal prices have stayed at an elevated level. 
Despite this incremental headwind, we are improving our earnings outlook for the business by approximately $55 million, with the improvement in both segments and to help alleviate the incremental commodity cost impact this year and in 2022, we are broadening the price increases announced last quarter to include additional markets. This outlook is not only a sharp turnaround from 2020, but also puts us more than $1 billion ahead of 2019 reported revenue with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 revenue, earnings and margins in both new equipment and service segments are expected to be higher than 2019. 
This improvement reflects our confidence in long-term strategy, ability to execute and the benefits of a solid end market recovery. And with that, may I request Angie to please open the line for questions."

And if you really look at EPS itself almost up 13% in '20, and our new guide at the midpoint really has it up 15% this year. We had been talking about high single digits at the midterm outlook. So we're going to revisit that as we go into the second half of this year, and we'll share more with you, we believe, early in '22 with probably a revised midterm outlook on all the metrics. Again, the end markets are far more positive. And if you have a chance and look at Slide 19 in the backup, you'll see for adjusted operating profit, for organic revenue, we did a compare that takes us to '19, '20 and '21, and the '21 outlook beats every metric fairly significantly even from '19. So Rahul and I have some work to do there, and we will get back to you in early '22."

No, that's a fair assessment. I think as you look at -- and Judy kind of alluded to that a little bit in her response to Jeff, I mean if you look at between first half and second half,  there's definitely more difficult to compare both on new equipment and on service. We were down about 10% in the first half of last year on new equipment, up a couple of points in the second half on new equipment in 2020. So the compares get tougher. Service Q2 last year was a weaker weakest quarter, I would say. And then Q3 and Q4 were down, but not as down as Q2. So definitely tougher compares getting into the second half. So that -- as we look at first half and second half compared for 2021, new equipment growth definitely slows down, but service is about flat in both up 4%, 4.5%, both first half and second half. So that growth looks consistent. 
And then if you look at the -- on the earnings side, obviously, second half reflects the change in volume growth assumptions, but also incremental commodity headwinds that we are seeing in the business, which is going to be a little bit more back half loaded. So you're seeing that. And -- but I mean, our productivity initiatives continue to deliver. We've seen good improvement in our installation execution out in the field. So that is covering a lot of issues that we're dealing with, especially on the commodity side. And if you look at first half and second half, I mean, second half, our earnings continue to grow, our margins continue to expand in both segments, and there's a decent drop-through coming on the volume growth that we are seeing. So we're seeing about a 10 basis points expansion in the new equipment. Margin in the second half was 90 basis points overall for the year. And on service, we're seeing about a 40, 50 basis points expansion in the second half and about 40 basis points for the full year. So we think it's a solid second half, recognizing a slightly different environment and a bit more difficult compare."

As Rahul mentioned, one of the 3 strategies we had to offset the commodity headwinds we're facing is a more broad-based price increase. We started this last quarter, very focused in a few countries, and now it will be more broad-based and go across all of our regions.  We are -- we always look at this in terms of what the market can bear and how the competitors respond in China, the top 10 OEMs have 90% of the market segment. So we heard the same thing you did last week about people raising prices. 
We are doing similar but obviously, we'll tailor it to the segments in China where we think we can get price and not give up share as well. Really pleased China results so far as we came through the quarter, record orders in the mid-teens. So very pleased with that, double-digit sales. And the team grew our portfolio mid-teens. So we gained share. We think we grew faster than the market. And even if China becomes more stable versus the high single-digit growth we saw in the segment in the first half,  it will still be a growth segment. Not the segment will be a growth for the year, and it will certainly be growth for Otis."

So it's been targeted, but the real actions to drive the offset beyond price that we're going to see quickly are the productivity we've gotten in installation, which as any of you who follow us know, we've had all these service productivity initiatives. We've invested in technology there. There's a ripe opportunity for us to continue to yield installation productivity. And then our material productivity has not stopped in the factories.

Obviously, that is still going through the quotes to the order cycle. So hopefully, you'll see the benefit of that in the second half of this year. 
We do expect pricing headwinds in terms of absolute dollar terms to be lower in the second half than we had in the first half. So that should start to help. And then we put in prices -- incremental price increases in additional markets across the world. This is a far more broader price increase. And this is because the markets are recovering better than what we thought.

So we will continue to drive shareholder value and remain open to M&A opportunities as they arise."

We set it as an internal target as we started the year. We've never hit 3% in the last decade. And so to us, this was important because, as you know, our service drives 80% of our profits, and then this has that knock-on effect, obviously, of the 5% you were talking about. 
So we set the target ourselves. We knew we needed to grow our portfolio in China where the service market is growing faster than anywhere else as well as in the emerging markets, including India, Southeast Asia, and other emerging markets. Our team has taken that on board. And this quarter was the first time we hit 3%. Last year, we were at 2%. I believe in 2019, we rounded to 1%. So -- we have a strategy in place to execute to do this, and a lot of it is basic block and tackling, perform, drive the conversions, drive the retention, stop the cancellations, delight the customer and then add that digital layer, that foundational layer of IoT that gives us more stickiness, and it's not just IoT, it's our eView, it's any of our -- any time we're connected to the customer, all of our retention rate goes up, our conversion rates go up. And so whether it's eCall, our Compass dispatch system, everything we're doing now with our -- and I'm just so excited about Gen3 and Gen360 and having now that architecture out there that will give us that foundation to continue to grow, and it's all about growing the service portfolio. So I think you've got it accurate, and I think it's sustainable."

So not to rehash the stuff that Judy just mentioned, but it clearly shows that we are doing our job. But and that is something we'll need to continue working on. I mean it's not a one and done thing. This is something that we need to keep pushing because we may keep building our cash offshore and we have to keep thinking of how do we bring it back to the U.S. So that has to be an ongoing activity, but really good progress.

Otis delivered an excellent second quarter, closing out a strong first half. This included mid-teens organic sales growth, demonstrating the resiliency of our colleagues in business and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy. Overall, demand in the New Equipment segment was strong, we gained about 1 point of new equipment share with orders up approximately 24% in a market that was up low teens. New Equipment orders grew in all regions and were particularly strong in the Americas up nearly 50% with an over 4x increase in major project bookings versus the prior year. These orders will support customer projects throughout North America. 
For example, in Canada, Otis secured an order to outfit a luxury high-rise condominium building in the M City community with several elevators, including custom cab interiors that fit the building's upscale design. 
Moving to Service. We grew sales in all lines of business, including repair and modernization. Modernization demand was strong, with orders up mid-teens versus the prior year. This includes another Otis partnership with Silverstein Properties in the Americas, where we will modernize more than 40 elevators in the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, and integrate Compass 360 and Otis' eCall app to allow for more seamless customer and tenant access to the building services. 
The demonstrated strength of the maintenance business continued, and we achieved 3% growth year-over-year on our industry-leading service portfolio, a key goal we set for ourselves entering this year. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in both segments, largely from the benefit of higher volume as New Equipment and Service organic sales grew about 25% and 8%, respectively. 
Since spin, our consistent performance reflects the power of our strategy and its implementation. I hope many of you were able to join us for Welcome to Tomorrow, where we shared our Gen3 and Gen360 highly innovative platforms that meet the current and future needs of our customers in an increasingly connected world. Gen3 builds upon the proven flat belt technology of Otis' best-selling Gen2 platform, while adding built-in Otis ONE IoT connectivity and a variety of options, such as eCall, eView, Compass dispatching systems, health solutions and updated aesthetics. APIs allow us to access and leverage data with analytics that drive value for our customers. Upon release, Otis secured an order for more than 100 Gen3 elevators for a new residential project in the Jilin province in Northeast China. In EMEA, after successful pilots in several countries, Otis officially launched Gen360: a next-generation, digitally native platform that includes all the features of the Gen3 elevator built around an all new electronic architecture in a more compact design. Gen360 is enabled with IoT capabilities and online tools, a connected passenger experience and additional safety features to help limit entrapments and enable maintenance from inside the elevator cab. 
In France, Otis was selected to outfit a future aquatic center in the Paris suburbs with the Gen360 ecosystem. In addition to its many digital safety and passenger benefits, this platform has a decisive advantage. For the first time, we can eliminate the need to accommodate hoistway projection onto the roof, avoiding interfering with the building's architectural lines, a feature desirable to architects and building owners. 
All of this strong first half performance, including robust free cash flow generation in excess of 150% of net income enables us to return additional cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we completed the previously planned $0.5 billion in share repurchases ahead of schedule and are now in a position to increase our 2021 target to $750 million. 
In parallel with the strong financial performance, we continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives that are integral to bringing our vision to life. In May, we released additional long-term ESG goals, aligning with our 4 ESG commitments: health and safety, people and communities, environment and impact and governance and accountability.  
During the quarter, we made progress on our goal to meet ISO 14001 certification standards in all of our factories. Otis' manufacturing facility in Brazil became the latest to achieve this certification, meaning nearly 90% of our factories are now ISO 14001-certified. This is part of our ongoing work to operate more sustainably. Initiatives in the factory include implementation of rain water and water reuse systems, LED lighting to reduce energy consumption by more than 2/3 and improvements to shipping and packaging materials to reduce waste by approximately 800 tonnes annually. 
In Paris, we introduced electric vehicles into our fleet, and we'll be expanding this pilot over the coming months. Early feedback from our field professionals has been positive, and the program will continue to contribute to our CO2 emission reduction targets. 
Moving to social. One year ago, in response to the urgent problems of social unrest and entrenched racism, we announced our commitment to change, a framework to ensure all colleagues feel safe, welcome and heard. While there's still work to be done, I'm proud of the process we've made on this initiative over the past year. Actions taken include engaging all supervisors worldwide in a training program designed to help them mitigate unconscious bias, increasing access to employee assistance and wellness programs globally, launching our Made to Move Communities signature STEM education program and awarding not-for-profit grants to communities in each region that support diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And in June, we began our second annual season of safety reinforcing Otis' strong safety culture, recommitting to our life-saving cardinal rules and prioritizing ongoing training on safety procedures and protocols.  We remain committed to a zero-harm workplace. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Second quarter results and 2021 outlook. In addition to record New Equipment bookings in the second quarter, total Otis orders were up 9.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 15.4% in the second quarter with 25.4% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 7.8% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $115 million and margin expanded 40 basis points despite a 60 basis point impact from segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the higher-margin Service business. 
Free cash flow was robust at $493 million, with 151% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum, our continued progress on our long-term strategy, and the pace of recovery in our end markets, gives us confidence to improve our 2021 outlook across all key metrics. We now expect sales to be in the range of $14.1 billion to $14.2 billion, up 10.5% to 11% versus the prior year and up 7.5% to 8% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.16 billion to $2.18 billion, up $240 million to $260 million at actual currency and up $170 million to $190 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint versus the prior outlook and now expected to be in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, a 15% to 16% increase versus the prior year. 
Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to a range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion with about 120% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q2 results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Adjusted oper",1461,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 22.2% to $3.7 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in New Equipment, and Service grew for the second consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 25% or $115 million and up $80 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments.  Favorable service pricing and productivity initiatives in both New Equipment and Service helped offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to absorb the impact from COVID-19. 
We maintained the focus on cost containment while continuing to invest in the business and adjusted SG&A was down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the step-up in public company expenses. R&D spend and other strategic investments were up approximately $8 million versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 40 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and a full point of margin expansion at constant segment mix. 
Second quarter adjusted EPS was up 41% or $0.23, driven primarily from $0.18 of operating profit growth and $0.06 from a lower adjusted tax rate. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 23.9% at constant currency, with growth in all regions. Orders momentum continued in the Americas and EMEA, up approximately 47% and 19%, respectively, as the markets recovered and the investments made by Otis continued to deliver. Orders in Asia were up approximately 17% and were up for the fifth consecutive quarter, including strength in China, where the orders were up mid-teens with record bookings during the quarter. Pricing was down 60 basis points, similar to the first quarter. Organic sales were up 25.4% with Americas and EMEA up mid-30s, driven by strong backlog execution as the business continues to progress towards pre-COVID levels. 
Asia was up mid-teens, driven by China, where organic sales were up double digits. Despite strong sales, there was broad-based growth in backlog that was up 10% and up 5% at constant currency, with backlog margin down about 0.5 point versus prior year, including any adverse product mix impact. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $64 million, primarily driven by higher volume.  The strong year-over-year improvement in installation execution and continued focus on material productivity helped to offset the unfavorable impact from price mix and commodity inflation. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 2 percentage points. 
Service segment results on Slide 7. Year-over-year growth in the number of units under maintenance contracts accelerated to 3%, reflecting strong global improvement in retention, recapture and conversion rates versus prior year. Number of units increased in all regions, and China was up mid-teens after a high single-digit growth in 2020. 
Modernization orders were strong in the quarter, up 16.8% at constant currency as North America and Europe grew double digits, a sharp rebound after a decline in 2020. Modernization backlog was up 4% at constant currency, providing a foundation for sales growth in the subsequent quarters. Service organic sales were up 7.8%, with growth in all lines of business. Growth accelerated in maintenance and repair to 7.5% from a strong recovery in repair with the contractual maintenance remaining resilient. 
Modernization sales were up 9.3%, from continued momentum in Asia Pacific and China and pickup of activity in EMEA. Adjusted operating profit grew $55 million from higher volume and improved pricing, including favorability from the absence of price concessions made last year. Translational FX benefit of $24 million was more than offset by incremental public company expenses and the snapback of COVID-related cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the sixth consecutive quarter and was up 10 basis points. 
Overall, the first half results reflect solid performance across all metrics, with 1.5 percentage points of New Equipment share gain, 13% organic sales growth and close to $200 million of adjusted operating profit growth. First half New Equipment and Service organic sales were up 25.3% and 4.5%, respectively, with margin expansion in both segments. 
Free cash flow generation was robust at $1 billion, enabling us to raise dividends and complete our debt repayment and previously announced $500 million of share buyback. As we look forward to the second half of 2021 on Slide 8, we feel confident about growth across all key metrics, given higher backlog, growth momentum in all lines of business and our focus on operational excellence. This, combined with strengthening demand in our end markets and strong first half results, gives us confidence to raise organic sales outlook to be up 7.5% to 8% for the year, up 275 basis points versus prior outlook. We now expect adjusted operating profit to grow $240 million to $260 million, up from $55 million in the prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS is expected in a range of $2.89 to $2.93, $0.10 higher than prior outlook and up 15% versus the prior year at the midpoint. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a 140 basis point reduction in the adjusted tax rate that is now expected to be 29% for the year from 29.5% in the prior outlook and a reduced share count. 
Following the strong cash generation in the first half from net income growth and close to $300 million of reduction in working capital from the end of the year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be in a range of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion. This is $75 million higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, from improved net income and better working capital performance. Given the improved free cash flow outlook and the success in repatriation of foreign cash, we are increasing the share buyback target for 2021 to $750 million. In addition, we will continue our bolt-on M&A activities and are always open to other opportunistic investments that can create value for our customers and shareholders. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. The New Equipment business is projected to be up 12% to 13% from 7.5% to 8.5% previously, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and continued recovery in the construction activity in several countries. This 450 basis point increase from prior outlook includes improved expectations in all regions. EMEA is now expected to be up high single digits. And we expect low teens growth in the Americas and Asia, driven by China. We are also improving our Service outlook by 125 basis points at the midpoint, now expected to be up 4% to 4.5%. This reflects improvement in maintenance and repair that is now expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% from maintenance portfolio growth and stronger discretionary repair demand. 
Modernization business is now expected to be up mid-single digits, driven by higher Q2 ending backlog. Overall, the organic sales outlook of 7.5% to 8% reflects growth across all regions and all lines of business. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profits to be up $240 million to $260 million versus prior year, including FX tailwind of approximately $70 million from strengthening of the renminbi and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up $170 million to $190 million. Total company margin is projected to improve by 30 basis points. This outlook reflects the benefits of higher volume, service, material and installation productivity initiatives and favorable service pricing. It is partially offset by unfavorable New Equipment price mix, headwinds from incremental stand-alone expenses and higher commodity prices. The commodity headwind for the year is now expected to be $70 million to $80 million for the year, approximately $35 million to $40 million higher than what we communicated in April as metal prices have stayed at an elevated level.
Despite this incremental headwind, we are improving our earnings outlook for the business by approximately $55 million, with the improvement in both segments. And to help alleviate the incremental commodity cost impact this year and in 2022, we are broadening the price increases announced last quarter to include additional markets. This outlook is not only a sharp turnaround from 2020, but also puts us more than $1 billion ahead of 2019 reported revenue with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 revenue, earnings and margins in both New Equipment and Service segments are expected to be higher than 2019. 
This improvement reflects our confidence in long-term strategy, ability to execute and the benefits of a solid end market recovery. And with that, may I request Angie to please open the line for questions."

We weren't quite sure what the midterm outlook that we shared, where that would come out. Again, strong performance through '20 and '21. 
And if you really look at EPS itself almost up 13% in '20, and our new guide at the midpoint really has it up 15% this year. We had been talking about high single digits at the midterm outlook. So we're going to revisit that as we go into the second half of this year, and we'll share more with you, we believe, early in '22 with probably a revised midterm outlook on all the metrics. Again, the end markets are far more positive. And if you have a chance and look at Slide 19 in the backup, you'll see for adjusted operating profit, for organic revenue, we did a compare that takes us to '19, '20 and '21, and the '21 outlook beats every metric fairly significantly even from '19. So Rahul and I have some work to do there, and we will get back to you in early '22."

No, that's a fair assessment. I think as you look at -- and Judy kind of alluded to that a little bit in her response to Jeff, I mean if you look at between first half and second half,  there's definitely more difficult to compare both on New Equipment and on Service. We were down about 10% in the first half of last year on New Equipment, up a couple of points in the second half on New Equipment in 2020. So the compares get tougher. Service Q2 last year was a weaker weakest quarter, I would say. And then Q3 and Q4 were down, but not as down as Q2. So definitely tougher compares getting into the second half. So that -- as we look at first half and second half compared for 2021, New Equipment growth definitely slows down, but Service is about flat in both up 4%, 4.5%, both first half and second half. So that growth looks consistent. 
And then if you look at the -- on the earnings side, obviously, second half reflects the change in volume growth assumptions, but also incremental commodity headwinds that we are seeing in the business, which is going to be a little bit more back half loaded. So you're seeing that. And -- but I mean, our productivity initiatives continue to deliver. We've seen good improvement in our installation execution out in the field. So that is covering a lot of issues that we're dealing with, especially on the commodity side. And if you look at first half and second half, I mean, second half, our earnings continue to grow, our margins continue to expand in both segments, and there's a decent drop-through coming on the volume growth that we are seeing. So we're seeing about a 10 basis points expansion in the New Equipment. Margin in the second half, a 90 basis points overall for the year. And on Service, we're seeing about a 40, 50 basis points expansion in the second half and about 40 basis points for the full year. So we think it's a solid second half, recognizing a slightly different environment and a bit more difficult compare."

Our profit is going to be up $240 million.

We are -- we always look at this in terms of what the market can bear and how the competitors respond in China, the top 10 OEMs have 90% of the market segment. So we heard the same thing you did last week about people raising prices. 
We are doing similar but obviously, we'll tailor it to the segments in China where we think we can get price and not give up share as well. Really pleased China results so far as we came through the quarter, record orders in the mid-teens. So very pleased with that, double-digit sales. And the team grew our portfolio mid-teens. So we gained share. We think we grew faster than the market.

We've invested in technology there. There's a ripe opportunity for us to continue to yield installation productivity. And then our material productivity has not stopped in the factories.

What we're seeing for the second quarter in a row is we gained share in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, which is where we were not performing as well as we needed to, and we're gaining share with the key accounts in China. So the agent distributor network is working for us. 
And I'll just -- Rahul spoke in his remarks about SG&A and us driving that down 60 basis points this quarter. our SG&A in a dollar amount actually grew because we are investing in the S part of it. We're continuing to add sales resources in focused markets where we're focusing on key segments and underserved markets in specific countries throughout the globe and our team is executing very well on that while we're trying to obviously drive the G&A piece down on increasing revenue.

I mean, we were very, very careful because, again, it was early in the year, we were not sure how the markets are recovering. So we were very targeted in those price increases. Obviously, that is still going through the quotes to the order cycle. So hopefully, you'll see the benefit of that in the second half of this year. 
We do expect pricing headwinds in terms of absolute dollar terms to be lower in the second half than we had in the first half. So that should start to help. And then we put in prices -- incremental price increases in additional markets across the world. This is a far more broader price increase. And this is because the markets are recovering better than what we thought. 
Americas, I think Judy said it earlier, Americas is now expected to be up maybe mid- to high single digits versus up slightly at the beginning of the year. China is going to be up more high versus mid. So markets are trending in the right direction, that gives us confidence, okay, market has the ability to absorb these price increases. So there's a much broader price increase, and that should show up into our numbers and more in '22, and maybe some in the first half, but maybe more in the second half in terms of absolute dollar benefit. So I think both of those statements are absolutely accurate because this 60 basis points of price decline that we saw in the quarter was more in response to the quotes that we issued last year."

We remain open to all opportunities from an M&A perspective. And we don't know when generational opportunities will come around, but we remain open and evaluate all opportunities. 1.5 years ago, we needed to repay debt. We needed to start our dividend. We had no cash -- no stock buybacks. We've repaid the debt we thought was at the appropriate level now so that our net debt-to-EBITDA is about a 1.7 kind of level, which we think is very healthy with the debt we're holding. We increased our dividend last quarter. And we've increased share buybacks. We weren't originally planning to do any this year. We announced $300 million in the first quarter -- or at the beginning of the year, $500 million last quarter, and now we're upping it to $750 million.

And so to us, this was important because, as you know, our service drives 80% of our profits, and then this has that knock-on effect, obviously, of the 5% you were talking about. 
So we set the target ourselves. We knew we needed to grow our portfolio in China where the service market is growing faster than anywhere else as well as in the emerging markets, including India, Southeast Asia, and other emerging markets. Our team has taken that on board. And this quarter was the first time we hit 3%. Last year, we were at 2%. I believe in 2019, we rounded to 1%. So -- we have a strategy in place to execute to do this, and a lot of it is basic block and tackling, perform, drive the conversions, drive the retention, stop the cancellations, delight the customer and then add that digital layer, that foundational layer of IoT that gives us more stickiness, and it's not just IoT, it's our eView, it's any of our -- any time we're connected to the customer, all of our retention rate goes up, our conversion rates go up.

We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Otis continued to make significant progress driving our long-term strategic priorities as reflected in the strong financial performance year-to-date. In the third quarter, we grew organic sales and expanded margins in both segments. We gained approximately 1.5 points of New Equipment share this quarter and year-to-date, on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, New Equipment orders were up mid-teens with growth in all regions, reflecting our continued focus on providing value for our customers and the recovery in our end markets throughout the year. 
In the quarter, New Equipment orders were particularly strong in Asia, up mid-teens, where we secured an order for the Hong Kong International Airport, extending an over 20-year relationship with this customer. We will install over 100 escalators in moving walkways to keep passengers moving across the concourse. This is further progress of our sub strategy to win in infrastructure. 
In China, we're seeing traction on our new Gen3-connected elevators, reaffirming our investment in the innovation that Otis ONE provides to our customers and passengers. Just a few months after officially launching our Gen3 elevator, we secured our first repeat customer in China for the new platform.  Jilin Long Cheng, property developer company, ordered an additional 123 Gen3 elevator systems for 4 more commercial and residential projects in Northeast China. 
We're also making progress on deploying our Gen360-connected elevator platform in EMEA. In the first few months after launch, we received several Gen360 awards, adding more than 50% to the pilot phase volumes. 
Moving to Service. In the quarter, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%, a goal we set for ourselves entering the year, and grew organic service sales for the third consecutive quarter. In the Americas, Otis was selected to continue a 35-year partnership with One Commerce Square in Downtown Philadelphia. Otis installed the building's original elevators in the 1980s and has been maintaining the units since then. Otis will now modernize the building's elevators, including the introduction of our Compass 360 destination dispatching system. ONE portfolio modernization awards are a testament to Otis service excellence and long-standing customer relationships. 
This strong year-to-date company performance and robust cash flow generation in excess of 140% of net income enabled us to complete $725 million in share repurchases. In September, we announced the tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis, a premier elevator business in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with a strong service presence. The transaction will simplify our corporate structure and operations while optimizing alignment of assets and debt financing in Europe. We expect this transaction to be mid-single-digit percentage accretive in 2023. 
In parallel with the strong financial performance, we made additional progress on our ESG initiatives. Focusing on sustainability has always been an integral part of our operations culture, and achieving ISO 14001 certification for all of our factories is an important part of our existing efforts. We're pleased that this quarter, we achieved this goal, years ahead of schedule, adding our factories in Korea and Florence, South Carolina. We're proud to see several programs recognized at these 2 factories, including power consumption reduction programs, robust package recycling processes and lubricant leakage-prevention measures. In addition, in Florence, we launched a pilot for zero waste to landfill program that will scale to other manufacturing sites next year as we work towards our goal of having all factories eligible for zero waste to landfill certification by 2025. 
We also made progress on our social initiatives, launching the second year of our Made to Move Communities signature CSR program. Participating colleagues will guide 200 student participants from 20 schools across 12 countries and territories to develop creative mobility solutions while also helping to close the STEM skills gap. This year, we aim to make a difference by helping communities adapt and leverage better design and newer technologies to address the mobility, health and safety concerns of older populations. We look forward to sharing these solutions and highlight the program with you during our Lift Our Communities month in April of next year. 
Now turning to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2021 outlook. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% in Q3 and up 10.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 8.1% in the third quarter, with 14.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 3.6% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $63 million and margin expanded 20 basis points, despite a 50 basis point impact from segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Year-to-date, we generated robust free cash flow of $1.4 billion or 141% conversion of GAAP net income. 
This positive momentum and our progress on our long-term strategy gives us the confidence to improve our 2021 outlook and positions us well to build upon this strong performance in 2022. We now expect sales for the year to be approximately $14.3 billion, up 11.8% to 12.3% versus the prior year and up 8.5% to 9% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion, up $260 million to $270 million in actual currency and up $195 million to $205 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS from the prior outlook by $0.04 at the midpoint and $0.06 from the low end and now expect it to be approximately $2.95, a 17% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to approximately $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with 125% conversion of GAAP net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q3 results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Net sales grew 10.8% to $3.6 billion, as the strong growth momentum continued in new equipment and Service grew for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up 12.5% or $63 million and up $52 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. 
Installation productivity initiatives in New Equipment and favorable Service pricing and productivity helped to offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to alleviate the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment while continuing to invest in the business. 
Adjusted SG&A was down 70 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the step-up in public company expenses. R&D and other strategic investments were up slightly versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 70 basis points of margin expansion at constant segment mix. 
Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 11.6% or $0.08, driven by $0.11 of operating profit growth, partially offset by $0.04 from a higher adjusted tax rate, due to the absence of a cumulative year-to-date tax benefit in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted tax rate is down by 180 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% at constant currency. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid-teens, including sixth consecutive quarter of growth in China. As expected, after a 47% growth in the second quarter, orders declined year-over-year in the Americas, primarily due to timing as awards, which preceded order booking in North America, were up approximately 24% versus the prior year. 
EMEA was down 1.8% from the timing of major project orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of strong demand globally, up double digits. Total company backlog increased 4% and 1% at constant currency from strong growth in China. Pricing on new orders declined by over 1 point, and backlog margin was down about 1 point versus prior year. Both pricing on new orders and backlog margin were about flat sequentially. 
Year-to-date, New Equipment orders were up 15%, including 13% growth in the Americas, mid-single-digit growth in EMEA and approximately 20% growth in Asia. Organic sales were up 14.1%, with growth in all regions. Americas was up mid-teens, driven by strong backlog execution as the business surpassed pre-COVID levels. EMEA was up low single digits and Asia grew high teens driven by China, where organic sales were up double digits. 
New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $33 million from higher volume. Pricing was marginally unfavorable in the quarter, and higher commodity prices were a headwind of $35 million, but we more than mitigated these impacts through strong installation execution, including favorable project closeouts, leading to 80 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. 
Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 3% versus the prior year, with global improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates. The number of units increased in all regions, and China was up high teens, accelerating from the mid-teens growth in the second quarter. 
There was pressure on modernization demand in the third quarter, and modernization orders were down 4.1% at constant currency as growth in EMEA and Asia was offset by a decline in the Americas, primarily driven by timing of orders as the market is recovering strongly in 2021. Overall, modernization backlog was up 2% at constant currency. 
Service organic sales were up 3.6%, with growth for the third consecutive quarter, as the business continues to recover from the impact of COVID. Maintenance and repair grew 4.7%, with strong recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were down 1.2% as growth in Europe and China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific from lingering COVID-related lockdowns and in the Americas from supply chain shortages. 
Adjusted operating profit grew $27 million as higher volume, productivity initiatives and improved pricing and mix more than offset the absence of favorability from COVID-related cost-containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up 30 basis points. Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance, with approximately 1.5 points of new equipment share gain, our best portfolio growth in the last decade; 11% organic sales growth; and $261 million of adjusted operating profit growth with margin expansion in both segments. 
We also generated close to $1.4 billion in free cash flow, enabling us to complete $725 million in share repurchases, raised dividends earlier this year, continue with bolt-on acquisitions and announced a tender offer for the remaining stake in Zardoya Otis. 
Looking forward to the balance of the year on Slide 8. We feel confident about strong growth across all key metrics for the year. We now expect organic sales to be up 8.5% to 9%, up 1 point from the prior outlook, with improvement in New Equipment segment. We now expect operating profit to grow between $260 million to $270 million, up $15 million from prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be approximately $2.95, $0.04 higher than prior outlook at the midpoint and up 17% versus the prior year. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a reduction in the adjusted tax rate and a reduced share count. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 28.5% to 29%, more than 150 basis point reduction versus the prior year and a 25 basis point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. 
Following strong year-to-date cash generation from net income growth and over $300 million reduction in working capital from the end of last year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be between $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion. This is up $50 million from the prior outlook from improved net income and reduced working capital. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New Equipment is now projected to be up 15% to 15.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and a 15% year-to-date orders growth. This is an increase of more than 250 basis points from the prior outlook and over 11-point improvement from our expectations at the beginning of the year. This broad-based improvement in expectations is supported by robust market growth in all regions, strong year-to-date performance and continued backlog growth. 
Americas is now up high teens -- sorry, up mid-teens, EMEA up high single digits and Asia up high teens, driven by China. In Service, we are adjusting our outlook to approximately 4% growth. The lower end of the prior range, reflecting slower-than-expected recovery on modernization in the second half of the year. Modernization is now expected to be up approximately 4% for the year from up mid-single digit previously, driven by COVID-related job site restrictions in Asia Pacific, slower decision-making in EMEA and some parts shortages in the Americas. Despite the resurgence of COVID in Asia Pacific, there is no change to the maintenance and repair outlook. That is still expected to be up approximately 4% for the year, driven by continued maintenance portfolio growth and recovery in discretionary repair. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 8.5% to 9% reflects a strong year-to-date performance and good momentum, positioning us well to deliver growth across all regions and all lines of business while building backlog to support continued growth in 2022. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up between $260 million to $270 million versus the prior year with margin expansion of 30 basis points. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up between $195 million to $205 million. This represents an improvement of $15 million versus the prior outlook from the impact of updated volume expectations in both segments and actions taken to reduce the corporate expenses. 
FX tailwind is now expected to be approximately $65 million, from $70 million that we were expecting previously, primarily due to recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, impacting the profit growth in the Service business. 
The year-over-year growth in operating profit reflects the benefits of higher volume, service productivity initiatives, favorable service pricing and strong installation execution. It is partially offset by unfavorable New Equipment price, mix headwinds from the absence of prior year cost-containment actions related to COVID-19 and higher commodity prices. The headwind from commodities is now expected to be between $80 million to $90 million for the year, at the higher end of what we communicated in July, driven partially by higher New Equipment volume in the year. 
The broader price increases announced last quarter have been rolled out and will help to alleviate the impact from higher commodity prices in 2022. Overall, this strong outlook puts us more than $1 billion ahead of our 2019 reported revenue, with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 sales, earnings and margin in both segments are expected to be higher than 2019. And adjusted EPS is expected to be up more than 30% versus 2019, reflecting broad-based improvement in performance, driven by our ability to execute, implementation of the long-term strategy and the benefits of a solid end-market recovery.

As we entered this year, we were expecting mid-single-digit growth in China. We have actually seen stronger growth year-to-date. And the segment itself, we believe, will end the year at high single digits. Through the first 9 months, all sectors in China have been strong: residential, commercial and infrastructure. We've seen increased activity in Tier 1 and 2 cities as well as in infrastructure and with our key accounts. 
The third quarter segment, we believe, grew mid-single digit, and we anticipate and have planned for the fourth quarter to be down correspondingly mid-single digit. 
So if we go back to '20, we thought it was going to be mid-single-digit growth. We've seen that. '21, we've seen high single-digit growth. We're still seeing healthy demand. This is the sixth quarter in a row that we've had New Equipment growth in China. But we're trying to be prudent for 2022, and we've actually planned for a flattish market there. And we're going to control what we can and what we know how to control. There's clearly heightened possibilities. There could be declines next year given the macro environment in the property sector. But we believe that the strategy we've put in place and the initiatives we've put for sales coverage for share gain and for price are really all paying off. 
We've added agents and distributors. So now we're at 2,300. We've added another 150 A&Ds in the third quarter. As Rahul shared in his opening comments, our portfolio growth is in the high teens. So our Service strategy is paying off with more coverage and more service depots, and our proposal volume was up significantly this quarter. 
So again, we're being prudent. We're watching what's going on, but we have put in place price increases. Those will yield in '22. They won't yield quicker than that because of our long-cycle business, but we're managing that as well. 
And I just will call your attention to that chart in the appendix and just put that as well into context. We did tens of millions of dollars of revenue across approximately 10 customers that have [ breached ] either the 2 or 3 red lines with their liquidity issues. And we share that, that -- those 10 customers are less than 3% of our China sales through the third quarter and less than 1% of Otis sales through the third quarter. And -- but we've been mitigating this since the 3 Red Line policy has come into play. And for any of these customers that crossed these red lines, we've moved to a cash advance cash basis. So we are working this on an account-by-account basis. We do not believe, and we've shared that the exposure is not large, and we're going to continue to managing this effectively and executing our strategy."

And Rahul shared, we've increased $80 million to $90 million, our impact on commodities this year, primarily driven by our volumes being up versus what we shared with you in July. So steel is not causing delays. We are not seeing significant delays on job sites in terms of labor. We're all watching installation subcontract labor, especially in Europe. But in terms of Otis labor, we have not had any delays in any of our job sites. And we've put plans in place. 
Our supply chain team has been dealing with this extremely effectively now for almost 2 years, whether it's semiconductors, ocean freight, we have not had delays in delivering to job sites from our New Equipment. Some of that's the benefit of our factories being local and our supply chains being local with global agreements. But we have done everything from spot buys and redesigning some of our chipsets from an engineering perspective to use more common chips to make sure there was no impact to our customers. So we've not seen that, but Rahul, I'll let you add."

So whatever parts are short, we can ship them later. But on modernization jobs, it's a little bit harder because they're shorter in duration. 
So on modernization, we've seen some impact from raw material shortages. And there's a little bit of a construction delay. It's not -- as Judy said, we are not experiencing delays from our factories. We can manage that, but there is a little bit of a construction slowdown or other shortages, and that's impacting some revenue on the New Equipment side, especially here in the U.S. But other than that, I think we are okay overall."

So overall, I think the numbers you quoted, Jeff, are exactly right. Pricing -- our overall pricing was down maybe slightly more than 1 point in Q3 here and was consistent with the booked margins in Q2. 
And on a regional basis, EMEA was better year-over-year, and pricing trends in both Asia Pacific and China were largely consistent with first half. And Americas pricing was slightly worse than first half, and it's more the mix of customers is where we saw the pressure. The distribution was a smaller share of orders, and that's a little bit -- comes at a little bit better pricing. But pricing in Americas in the volume business was consistent with the first half. 
So you put all that in context, the fact is the pricing trends, basically, what we saw in first half is continuing into Q3. So no sequential change from the first half into Q3. And the price increases that we've put in place, we've rolled them out pretty much across the board at this point. And where you will see that impact is those quotes have not yet converted to orders, which is fairly typical because that's the cycle from quotation to orders. And they'll probably start up maybe showing up in late Q4, early Q1. And the benefit of that, as Judy said in response to Nigel's question, will probably show up in 2022. 
Let me pause there, see if -- and Judy, if you want to add something on competitive dynamics?"

Rahul hit it right on. 
And the only thing I would tell you is we are seeing some headwinds on pricing, but we're up -- our New Equipment margins are up 150 basis points year-to-date. So we're able to, as we've always said, try to get it with price, but we understand the lag time; increase our installation efficiency, which we did very well in the third quarter globally; as well as continue to control what we can in terms of productivity in our factories, material productivity and every lever we have. So it's going to be competitive. It's going to continue to be, but the end markets are growing across the globe. So strong demand. And we're going to continue to try and get price everywhere we can."

So Jeff, what I'll say there is, a, I think I said it in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across the board. And it was very, very strong in China.

So Jeff, what I'll say there is, a, I think I said it in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across the board. And it was very, very strong in China. And our proposal volume was up close to 40% in China. I think that goes back to what Judy said earlier, is it's driven by all the things that we have done, our increase in our channel partners, increase in our sales force. Our sales force is up by more than 10% in addition to the growth in the channel partners. So we have invested a ton to increase our reach in China, which is up close to 10 points as well. So all the things that we are doing is driving incremental activity on our side. 
But if you step back and even look at the market overall, if you look at the flow space under construction is up 8% year-to-date and 10-plus percent over 2019. The real estate investment is up 9% year-over-year. So -- and historically, there has been a very, very strong correlation between these 2 metrics and the elevator growth. But the reality is the situation is fluid today. And after a very strong start in the first half, the starts have slowed down in the last couple of months. So we are watching it very, very carefully. But again, I think if you want to grow the overall economy next year, even if you say the Chinese government doesn't set a target of 6%, but it set a target of 5%, with 30% of the GDP coming from the property market, it will be hard for them to achieve 5% to 6% growth next year with the property market being down. 
So this is where, I think going back to what Judy said earlier, we expect the market to be more stable for next year. But again, we'll keep watching it and keep doing what we can control, which is driving incremental effort on our side. And the healthy proposal activity is a good sign for us to come."

Second, we've already been approached by people other than these developers in local governments to finish some job sites on an advanced cash basis. So we believe the work in progress is going to continue even with the developers that are experiencing 2 or 3 red lines. And so we're -- but again, we're being prudent.

And that is where you'll see -- start see an improvement in both our book margin and backlog margin. So that is when we expect the trends to turn. 
But in the meanwhile, going back to our earlier response, we are just continuing to execute really, really well on the installation side, and that is what's driving our increase in year-to-date margin. So that is offsetting both the pricing pressure and the commodity headwinds. I mean, despite both those headwinds between incremental volumes that drives higher absorption and the installation execution, which we've said was always a priority between those 2 things, that's what's helping us continue to grow our New Equipment margins. 
And if you look at even the full year guide, last quarter, we said maybe it's 90. This quarter, it's up 90 basis points for the year, margin expansion. And this guide, we think we can get between 90 to 100 basis points. despite everything, we are actually improving our margin outlook on the New Equipment segment for the year."

I just wondered, when you compare this up-cycle in nonresidential with the one 12 years ago, this up-cycle has recovered far more quickly out of the recession than coming out of 2009.

It's at the end of the GFC, which is really when we felt it more in the Americas. And our guide has us going up mid-teens from the low teens. We've got a strong backlog execution. And year-to-date in the Americas, if you take out the lumpiness and just go year-to-date, we're at 13.3% growth in the Americas and a 12-month roll of a healthy number as well. So we see the Americas doing, coming back strong. The Dodge Momentum Index was up 164.9, and the Architects Billing Index was at 56.6. So the indices are trending the right way, and we're doing well. 
Again, it's -- and no 1 quarter makes an orders book. We don't control all the timing on those orders. But year-to-date, the Americas has done tremendously incredible second quarter and now again in the third quarter. 
EMEA, 6.3% year-to-date, down a little in the third quarter, but that's kind of timing. And we think we'll see both of those nicely accelerate in Q4, and that's important for us. We want to end the year with higher than the 1% backlog we're sitting at today. And our entire team understands that. We're -- we believe we can do that in the Americas because the awards are up, as Rahul said in his opening remarks, and that is a leading indicator where we've got the awards already. And we've got the LOIs, and now we have to move it to a booking and get everything finished. But we expect a strong fourth quarter and plan to end the year with a backlog that -- of 2-plus percent, hopefully closer to 3%. We'll have to see where that comes out so that we start '22 strong."

But again, the first half was very strong. So that is where if you come back. 
And if you look at the other metrics, which I won't repeat because you've gone through those like the construction and the real estate investment. I mean, and historically, they've had a pretty high correlation with the elevator market. So that is where we still feel the market is going to be more flattish for next year. And keep in mind that, that level of -- is at more than 600,000 units and comes after 2 very strong years of growth, high single digits this year and mid-single digits last year. So we think if the market stabilizes at this level, that's a very healthy demand for the market and, driven by all the self-help initiatives that we are driving, gives us an opportunity to continue to drive gains in our China business."

So -- and the service business is accelerating very, very nicely as well, driven by the portfolio growth that we've been talking about. 
And what we've said historically is that China is 1 of our more profitable New Equipment businesses. In fact, the most profitable of all regions in terms of how we report. And on the Service side, it is the least profitable of our regions. So -- and then you put the mix on top of it. So that the mix and the New Equipment service mix also works against the overall [ drop ] in China.

I mean if you think about the working capital reduction that we've been able to drive, we've had our third consecutive quarter of negative working capital. It's down, as I said in my prepared remarks, more than $300 million from where we ended the year. So very, very strong performance on cash. 
Now the two things that kind of -- or I would say three things that work as you go from -- sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, the first is that there is historically a buildup of working capital between third quarter and fourth quarter. So if you look at the last couple of years, where cash flow is available, you'll see an increase in working capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that's 1 driver. 
The second is based on the guide that you provided, there's lower net income in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. So that's the second piece. And we still have that tax payment in 1 of the European countries that we've alluded to before. That's a long-standing tax matter that predates spin that we still need to make in the fourth quarter here. And that, we've signed previously between at tens of millions of dollars. So those are the kind of the 3 big levers, I would say, as you go from third quarter to fourth quarter cash flow. So that is why fourth quarter cash flow is last, but still [ now ] $50 million higher than where we were 3 months ago, and it's driven by improvement in net income and better working capital performance and a very, very healthy number for the year. I think it's close to 125% [ top ]."

So from a financial standpoint, Cai, it's very, very straightforward. I mean you look at our -- there's -- and I think we said this in our press release, about $80 million of net cash outflow that we make to our JV partners there, both minority and the family, the small individual shareowners and the institutional shareholders and the family combined. So that's about $80 million. 
Now if we -- so that, obviously, that's something that we don't have to make once we have full ownership of Zardoya. And then we will borrow. As you said, our intention is to borrow in Europe. So we'll do the borrowing in Europe. And so that is where if you net the 2 out, we expect mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. 
Now in 2022, it's going to be less than that. Because the fact is it's going to take us a few months here, we just filed the prospectus. It's going to take 3 to 4 months for that filing to get approved, then we launched the tender, then there's a delisting period and it may take us time to ramp up to the full ownership. So there's going to be a staggered increase in our ownership. And that is where I think we said in the press release, we expect maybe $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion in 2022, just given the timing of the close and the timing of acquisition of shares. So those 2 things will get us to $0.04 -- I think we said $0.04 to $0.06 in the press release. So somewhere in that range for '22 and then mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Hopefully, that answers the question, Cai. And then maybe, Judy, do you want talk about the operational."

So maybe $70 million for the first half. 
And then beyond that, if you look at the commodity forwards today, they start going the other way starting May, June of '22. And we start -- right now, the forwards would project that there will be a tailwind in the second half of next year, but it's too early to call that. 
But again, go back to -- our thesis is going to be that for next year, we can continue driving earnings expansion both -- in both segments, New Equipment coming from higher volume, given where Judy said that we have a plan to ending the backlog. It's kind of in that low single-digit growth range. So we'll continue to drive revenue growth on the New Equipment segment with incremental, some help from pricing that we've already put in place and our continued execution on installation. We think we can use all that to offset any commodity headwind in the first half and drive earnings expansion. And on Service, I think our pricing should be a tailwind for next year given where prices are. And the volume should accelerate to kind of more mid-single-digit growth, which is what we expect."

Nick, it's coming from New Equipment. We are -- we spoke about the material productivity starting right when we did our first Investor Day. So we've been talking about it.

We are -- we spoke about the material productivity starting right when we did our first Investor Day. So we've been talking about it. That's a key driver for us. So we continue to push really, really hard on that. 
In addition, we've been driving installation efficiency, so that means better project closeouts and ending the project at a higher margin than what we booked at. And that includes both using fewer hours to install the product and taking cost out of the material. Because not the entire material cost comes from the fact that there's incremental material procurement that happens in the field. So we've been spending a lot of time and effort to understand where the supply base is and how we can take cost out of that. So that has been the major push here, and that is where you're seeing. 
And again, we are in early stages of that. We just started it. We saw good results in Q2. We saw good results in Q3. So we're in early stages of that, and we need that installation efficiency to continue to get better as we get into '22. So that will be a push for us. 
And on Service productivity, which again, has been a tailwind for us, despite catch-up of maintenance hours and all the COVID-related headwinds that we are absorbing, our Q3 hours are still down year-over-year to maintain an elevator. So that comes from the push that we have on Otis ONE and some of the other productivity things that we're doing. So that is what is driving our service productivity, which continues to be -- which continue to be strong in Q2."

I think we've appropriately tempered the fourth quarter to the low end of the service guidance for that reason. But we don't see this or the EMEA demand or the Asia Pacific demand going away by any point. Modernization is going to continue to grow. And we know what we need to do. If you look all in year-to-date, our orders are up 4.3%, and our sales are up 2.7%.

We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Otis continued to make significant progress driving our long-term strategic priorities as reflected in the strong financial performance year-to-date. In the third quarter, we grew organic sales and expanded margins in both segments. We gained approximately 1.5 points of New Equipment share this quarter and year-to-date, on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, New Equipment orders were up mid-teens with growth in all regions, reflecting our continued focus on providing value for our customers and the recovery in our end markets throughout the year. 
In the quarter, New Equipment orders were particularly strong in Asia, up mid-teens, where we secured an order for the Hong Kong International Airport, extending an over 20-year relationship with this customer. We will install over 100 escalators and moving walkways to keep passengers moving across the concourse. This is further progress of our sub strategy to win in infrastructure. 
In China, we're seeing traction on our new Gen3-connected elevators, reaffirming our investment in the innovation that Otis ONE provides to our customers and passengers. Just a few months after officially launching our Gen3 elevator, we secured our first repeat customer in China for the new platform. Jilin Longcheng property developer company ordered an additional 123 Gen3 elevator systems for 4 more commercial and residential projects in Northeast China. 
We're also making progress on deploying our Gen360-connected elevator platform in EMEA. In the first few months after launch, we received several Gen360 awards, adding more than 50% to the pilot phase volumes. 
Moving to Service. In the quarter, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%, a goal we set for ourselves entering the year, and grew organic service sales for the third consecutive quarter. In the Americas, Otis was selected to continue a 35-year partnership with One Commerce Square in Downtown Philadelphia. Otis installed the building's original elevators in the 1980s and has been maintaining the units since then. Otis will now modernize the building's elevators, including the introduction of our Compass 360 destination dispatching system. One portfolio modernization awards are a testament to Otis' service excellence and long-standing customer relationships. 
This strong year-to-date company performance and robust cash flow generation in excess of 140% of net income enabled us to complete $725 million in share repurchases. In September, we announced the tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis, a premier elevator business in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with a strong service presence. The transaction will simplify our corporate structure and operations while optimizing alignment of assets and debt financing in Europe. We expect this transaction to be mid-single-digit percentage accretive in 2023.
In parallel with the strong financial performance, we made additional progress on our ESG initiatives. Focusing on sustainability has always been an integral part of our operations culture and achieving ISO 14001 certification for all of our factories is an important part of our existing efforts. We're pleased that this quarter, we achieved this goal, years ahead of schedule, adding our factories in Korea and Florence, South Carolina. We're proud to see several programs recognized at these 2 factories, including power consumption reduction programs, robust package recycling processes and lubricant leakage prevention measures. In addition, in Florence, we launched a pilot for Zero Waste to Landfill Program that will scale to other manufacturing sites next year as we work towards our goal of having all factories eligible for Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2025. 
We also made progress on our social initiatives, launching the second year of our Made to Move Communities signature CSR program. Participating colleagues will guide 200 student participants from 20 schools across 12 countries and territories to develop creative mobility solutions while also helping to close the STEM skills gap. This year, we aim to make a difference by helping communities adapt and leverage better design and newer technologies to address the mobility, health and safety concerns of older populations. We look forward to sharing these solutions and highlight the program with you during our Lift Our Communities Month in April of next year. 
Now turning to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2021 outlook. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% in Q3 and up 10.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 8.1% in the third quarter, with 14.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment and 3.6% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $63 million and margin expanded 20 basis points, despite a 50 basis point impact from segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Year-to-date, we generated robust free cash flow of $1.4 billion or 141% conversion of GAAP net income.
This positive momentum and our progress on our long-term strategy gives us the confidence to improve our 2021 outlook and positions us well to build upon this strong performance in 2022. We now expect sales for the year to be approximately $14.3 billion, up 11.8% to 12.3% versus the prior year and up 8.5% to 9% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion, up $260 million to $270 million in actual currency and up $195 million to $205 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS from the prior outlook by $0.04 at the midpoint and $0.06 from the low end and now expect it to be approximately $2.95, a 17% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to approximately $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with 125% conversion of GAAP net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q3 results and 2021 outlook in more detail."

Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 10.8% to $3.6 billion, as the strong growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service grew for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted operat",1604,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 10.8% to $3.6 billion, as the strong growth momentum continued in New Equipment and Service grew for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up 12.5% or $63 million and up $52 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. 
Installation productivity initiatives in New Equipment and favorable service pricing and productivity helped to offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to alleviate the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment while continuing to invest in the business. 
Adjusted SG&A was down 70 basis points as a percentage of sales despite the step-up in public company expenses. R&D and other strategic investments were up slightly versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 70 basis points of margin expansion at constant segment mix. 
Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 11.6% or $0.08, driven by $0.11 of operating profit growth, partially offset by $0.04 from a higher adjusted tax rate, due to the absence of a cumulative year-to-date tax benefit in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted tax rate is down by 180 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% at constant currency. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid-teens, including sixth consecutive quarter of growth in China. As expected, after a 47% growth in the second quarter, orders declined year-over-year in the Americas, primarily due to timing as awards, which precede order booking in North America, were up approximately 24% versus the prior year.
EMEA was down 1.8% from the timing of major project orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of strong demand globally, up double digits. Total company backlog increased 4% and 1% at constant currency from strong growth in China. Pricing on new orders declined by over 1 point, and backlog margin was down about 1 point versus prior year. Both pricing on new orders and backlog margin were about flat sequentially. 
Year-to-date, New Equipment orders were up 15%, including 13% growth in the Americas, mid-single-digit growth in EMEA and approximately 20% growth in Asia. Organic sales were up 14.1%, with growth in all regions. Americas was up mid-teens, driven by strong backlog execution as the business surpassed pre-COVID levels. EMEA was up low single digits and Asia grew high teens driven by China, where organic sales were up double digits. 
New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $33 million from higher volume. Pricing was marginally unfavorable in the quarter, and higher commodity prices were a headwind of $35 million, but we more than mitigated these impacts through strong installation execution, including favorable project closeouts, leading to 80 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion.
Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 3% versus the prior year, with global improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates. The number of units increased in all regions, and China was up high teens, accelerating from the mid-teens growth in the second quarter. There was pressure on modernization demand in the third quarter, and modernization orders were down 4.1% at constant currency as growth in EMEA and Asia was offset by a decline in the Americas, primarily driven by timing of orders as the market is recovering strongly in 2021. Overall, modernization backlog was up 2% at constant currency. 
Service organic sales were up 3.6%, with growth for the third consecutive quarter, as the business continues to recover from the impact of COVID. Maintenance and repair grew 4.7%, with strong recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were down 1.2% as growth in Europe and China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific from lingering COVID-related lockdowns and in the Americas from supply chain shortages. 
Adjusted operating profit grew $27 million as higher volume, productivity initiatives and improved pricing and mix more than offset the absence of favorability from COVID-related cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up 30 basis points. Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance, with approximately 1.5 points of New Equipment share gain, our best portfolio growth in the last decade; 11% organic sales growth; and $261 million of adjusted operating profit growth with margin expansion in both segments.
We also generated close to $1.4 billion in free cash flow, enabling us to complete $725 million in share repurchases, raise dividends earlier this year, continue with bolt-on acquisitions and announce the tender offer for the remaining stake in Zardoya Otis. 
Looking forward to the balance of the year on Slide 8. We feel confident about strong growth across all key metrics for the year. We now expect organic sales to be up 8.5% to 9%, up 1 point from the prior outlook, with improvement in New Equipment segment. We now expect operating profit to grow between $260 million to $270 million, up $15 million from prior outlook at the midpoint, with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments.
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be approximately $2.95, $0.04 higher than prior outlook at the midpoint and up 17% versus the prior year. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a reduction in the adjusted tax rate and a reduced share count. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 28.5% to 29%, more than 150 basis point reduction versus the prior year and a 25 basis point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. 
Following strong year-to-date cash generation from net income growth and over $300 million reduction in working capital from the end of last year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be between $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion. This is up $50 million from the prior outlook from improved net income and reduced working capital. 
Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New Equipment is now projected to be up 15% to 15.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and a 15% year-to-date orders growth. This is an increase of more than 250 basis points from the prior outlook and over 11-point improvement from our expectations at the beginning of the year. This broad-based improvement in expectations is supported by robust market growth in all regions, strong year-to-date performance and continued backlog growth. 
Americas is now up high teens -- sorry, up mid-teens, EMEA up high single digits and Asia up high teens, driven by China. In Service, we are adjusting our outlook to approximately 4% growth, the lower end of the prior range, reflecting slower-than-expected recovery on modernization in the second half of the year. Modernization is now expected to be up approximately 4% for the year from up mid-single digit previously, driven by COVID-related job site restrictions in Asia Pacific, slower decision-making in EMEA and some parts shortages in the Americas. Despite the resurgence of COVID in Asia Pacific, there is no change to the maintenance and repair outlook. That is still expected to be up approximately 4% for the year, driven by continued maintenance portfolio growth and recovery in discretionary repair. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 8.5% to 9% reflects a strong year-to-date performance and good momentum, positioning us well to deliver growth across all regions and all lines of business while building backlog to support continued growth in 2022.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up between $260 million to $270 million versus the prior year with margin expansion of 30 basis points. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up between $195 million to $205 million. This represents an improvement of $15 million versus the prior outlook from the impact of updated volume expectations in both segments and actions taken to reduce the corporate expenses. 
FX tailwind is now expected to be approximately $65 million, from $70 million that we were expecting previously, primarily due to recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, impacting the profit growth in the Service business. The year-over-year growth in operating profit reflects the benefits of higher volume, service productivity initiatives, favorable service pricing and strong installation execution. It is partially offset by unfavorable New Equipment price mix, headwinds from the absence of prior year cost containment actions related to COVID-19 and higher commodity prices. The headwind from commodities is now expected to be between $80 million to $90 million for the year, at the higher end of what we communicated in July, driven partially by higher New Equipment volume in the year.
The broader price increases announced last quarter have been rolled out and will help to alleviate the impact from higher commodity prices in 2022. Overall, this strong outlook puts us more than $1 billion ahead of our 2019 reported revenue, with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 sales, earnings and margin in both segments are expected to be higher than 2019. And adjusted EPS is expected to be up more than 30% versus 2019, reflecting broad-based improvement in performance, driven by our ability to execute, implementation of the long-term strategy and the benefits of a solid end-market recovery.

As we entered this year, we were expecting mid-single-digit growth in China. We have actually seen stronger growth year-to-date. And the segment itself, we believe, will end the year at high single digits. Through the first 9 months, all sectors in China have been strong: residential, commercial and infrastructure. We've seen increased activity in Tier 1 and 2 cities as well as in infrastructure and with our key accounts. 
The third quarter segment, we believe, grew mid-single digit, and we anticipate and have planned for the fourth quarter to be down correspondingly mid-single digit. 
So if we go back to '20, we thought it was going to be mid-single-digit growth. We've seen that. '21, we've seen high single-digit growth. We're still seeing healthy demand. This is the sixth quarter in a row that we've had New Equipment growth in China. But we're trying to be prudent for 2022, and we've actually planned for a flattish market there. And we're going to control what we can and what we know how to control. There's clearly heightened possibilities. There could be declines next year given the macro environment in the property sector. But we believe that the strategy we've put in place and the initiatives we've put for sales coverage, for share gain and for price are really all paying off. 
We've added agents and distributors. So now we're at 2,300. We've added another 150 A&Ds in the third quarter. As Rahul shared in his opening comments, our portfolio growth is in the high teens. So our service strategy is paying off with more coverage and more service depots, and our proposal volume was up significantly this quarter. 
So again, we're being prudent. We're watching what's going on, but we have put in place price increases. Those will yield in '22. They won't yield quicker than that because of our long-cycle business, but we're managing that as well. 
And I just will call your attention to that chart in the appendix and just put that as well into context. We did tens of millions of dollars of revenue across approximately 10 customers that have breached either the 2 or 3 red lines with their liquidity issues. And we share that, that -- those 10 customers are less than 3% of our China sales through the third quarter and less than 1% of Otis sales through the third quarter. And -- but we've been mitigating this since the 3 red line policy has come into play. And for any of these customers that crossed these red lines, we've moved to a cash -- advance cash basis. So we are working this on an account-by-account basis. We do not believe and we've shared that the exposure is not large, and we're going to continue to managing this effectively and executing our strategy."

Obviously, steel -- and again, it's, in our New Equipment business, about $300 million a year of commodities that we purchased.

And Rahul shared, we've increased $80 million to $90 million, our impact on commodities this year, primarily driven by our volumes being up versus what we shared with you in July. So steel is not causing delays. We are not seeing significant delays on job sites in terms of labor. We're all watching installation subcontract labor, especially in Europe. But in terms of Otis labor, we have not had any delays in any of our job sites. 
And we've put plans in place. Our supply chain team has been dealing with this extremely effectively now for almost 2 years, whether it's semiconductors, ocean freight, we have not had delays in delivering to job sites from our New Equipment. Some of that's the benefit of our factories being local and our supply chains being local with global agreements. But we have done everything from spot buys and redesigning some of our chipsets from an engineering perspective to use more common chips to make sure there was no impact to our customers. So we've not seen that, but Rahul, I'll let you add."

Elevator doesn't go in one box or as a completed unit. We actually assemble the elevator, as you guys know, on the job site. So it goes in a couple of dozen crates, right? So whatever parts are short, we can ship them later. But on modernization jobs, it's a little bit harder because they're shorter in duration.
So on modernization, we've seen some impact from raw material shortages. And there's a little bit of a construction delay. It's not -- as Judy said, we are not experiencing delays from our factories. We can manage that, but there is a little bit of a construction slowdown or other shortages, and that's impacting some revenue on the New Equipment side, especially here in the U.S. But other than that, I think we are okay overall."

So overall, I think the numbers you quoted, Jeff, are exactly right. Pricing -- our overall pricing was down maybe slightly more than 1 point in Q3 here and was consistent with the booked margins in Q2.
And on a regional basis, EMEA was better year-over-year, and pricing trends in both Asia Pacific and China were largely consistent with first half. And Americas pricing was slightly worse than first half, and it's more the mix of customers is where we saw the pressure. The distribution was a smaller share of orders, and that's a little bit -- comes at a little bit better pricing. But pricing in Americas in the volume business was consistent with the first half. 
So you put all that in context, the fact is the pricing trends, basically, what we saw in first half is continuing into Q3. So no sequential change from the first half into Q3. And the price increases that we've put in place, we've rolled them out pretty much across the board at this point. And where you will see that impact is those quotes have not yet converted to orders, which is fairly typical because that's the cycle from quotation to orders. And they'll probably start up maybe showing up in late Q4, early Q1. And the benefit of that, as Judy said in response to Nigel's question, will probably show up in 2022. 
Let me pause there, see -- and Judy, if you want to add something on competitive dynamics."

Rahul hit it right on. 
And the only thing I would tell you is we are seeing some headwinds on pricing, but we're up -- our New Equipment margins are up 150 basis points year-to-date. So we're able to, as we've always said, try to get it with price, but we understand the lag time; increase our installation efficiency, which we did very well in the third quarter globally as well as continue to control what we can in terms of productivity in our factories, material productivity and every lever we have. So it's going to be competitive. It's going to continue to be, but the end markets are growing across the globe. So strong demand. And we're going to continue to try and get price everywhere we can."

So Jeff, what I'll say there is, a, I think I said it in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across the board. And it was very, very strong in China.

So Jeff, what I'll say there is, a, I think I said it in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across the board. And it was very, very strong in China. And our proposal volume was up close to 40% in China. I think that goes back to what Judy said earlier is it's driven by all the things that we have done, our increase in our channel partners, increase in our sales force. Our sales force is up by more than 10% in addition to the growth in the channel partners. So we have invested a ton to increase our reach in China, which is up close to 10 points as well. So all the things that we are doing is driving incremental activity on our side.
But if you step back and even look at the market overall, if you look at the flow space under construction is up 8% year-to-date and 10-plus percent over 2019. The real estate investment is up 9% year-over-year. So -- and historically, there has been a very, very strong correlation between these 2 metrics and the elevator growth. But the reality is the situation is fluid today. And after a very strong start in the first half, the starts have slowed down in the last couple of months. So we are watching it very, very carefully. But again, I think if you want to grow the overall economy next year, even if you say the Chinese government doesn't set a target of 6%, but it set a target of 5%, with 30% of the GDP coming from the property market, it will be hard for them to achieve 5% to 6% growth next year with the property market being down. 
So this is where, I think, going back to what Judy said earlier, we expect the market to be more stable for next year. But again, we'll keep watching it and keep doing what we can control, which is driving incremental effort on our side. And the healthy proposal activity is a good sign for us to come."

Second, we've already been approached by people other than these developers in local governments to finish some job sites on an advanced cash basis. So we believe the work in progress is going to continue even with the developers that were experiencing 2 or 3 red lines. And so we're -- but again, we're being prudent.

And that is where you'll see -- start seeing an improvement in both our booked margin and backlog margin. So that is when we expect the trends to turn. 
But in the meanwhile, going back to our earlier response, we are just continuing to execute really, really well on the installation side, and that is what's driving our increase in year-to-date margin. So that is offsetting both the pricing pressure and the commodity headwinds. I mean, despite both those headwinds between incremental volumes that drives higher absorption and the installation execution, which we've said was always a priority between those 2 things, that's what's helping us continue to grow our New Equipment margins.
And if you look at even the full year guide, last quarter, we said maybe it's 90. This quarter, it's up 90 basis points for the year margin expansion.

I just wondered, when you compare this up-cycle in nonresidential with the one 12 years ago, this up-cycle has recovered far more quickly out of the recession than coming out of 2009.

It's at the end of the GFC, which is really when we felt it more in the Americas. And our guide has us going up mid-teens from the low teens. We've got a strong backlog execution. And year-to-date in the Americas, if you take out the lumpiness and just go year-to-date, we're at 13.3% growth in the Americas and a 12-month roll of a healthy number as well. So we see the Americas doing -- coming back strong. The Dodge Momentum Index was up 164.9, and the Architects Billing Index was at 56.6. So the indices are trending the right way, and we're doing well. 
Again, it's -- and no one quarter makes an orders book. We don't control all the timing on those orders. But year-to-date, the Americas has done tremendously incredible second quarter and now again in the third quarter. 
EMEA, 6.3% year-to-date, down a little in the third quarter, but that's kind of timing. And we think we'll see both of those nicely accelerate in Q4, and that's important for us. We want to end the year with higher than the 1% backlog we're sitting at today. And our entire team understands that. We're -- we believe we can do that in the Americas because the awards are up, as Rahul said in his opening remarks, and that is a leading indicator where we've got the awards already. And we've got the LOIs, and now we have to move it to a booking and get everything finished. But we expect a strong fourth quarter and plan to end the year with a backlog that -- of 2-plus percent, hopefully closer to 3%. We'll have to see where that comes out so that we start '22 strong."

And if you look at the other metrics, which I won't repeat because you've gone through those like the construction and the real estate investment.

So if you take a China business, year-to-date sales of about $2.1 billion or so. So that's our revenue for China year-to-date. Now it's typically 80-20, 80% New Equipment and 20% Service. So -- and the Service business is accelerating very, very nicely as well, driven by the portfolio growth that we've been talking about. And what we've said historically is that China is one of our more profitable New Equipment businesses. It's in fact, the most profitable of all regions in terms of how we report. 
And on the Service side, it is the least profitable of our regions. So -- and then you put the mix on top of it. So that -- the mix -- the New Equipment and Service mix also works against the overall drop in China. So that's where -- I'll say so the overall, I mean you put all that together, the China profitability is maybe overall lower than where Otis reports. So that's kind of where we are. And then obviously, the JV shares, we've got 2 JVs in China, and we've not disclosed our ownership. But obviously, it's somewhere between 50% to 100%. So it's somewhere in there. But you're right.

I mean if you think about the working capital reduction that we've been able to drive, we've had our third consecutive quarter of negative working capital. It's down, as I said in my prepared remarks, more than $300 million from where we ended the year. So very, very strong performance on cash. 
Now the 2 things that kind of -- or I would say 3 things that work as you go from -- sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, the first is that there is historically a buildup of working capital between third quarter and fourth quarter. So if you look at the last couple of years, where cash flow is available, you'll see an increase in working capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that's one driver. 
The second is based on the guide that you provided, there's lower net income in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. So that's the second piece. And we still have that tax payment in one of the European countries that we've alluded to before. That's a long-standing tax matter that predates spin that we still need to make in the fourth quarter here. And that, we've signed previously between at tens of millions of dollars. So those are the kind of the 3 big levers, I would say, as you go from third quarter to fourth quarter cash flow. So that is why fourth quarter cash flow is less, but still $50 million higher than where we were 3 months ago, and it's driven by improvement in net income and better working capital performance and a very, very healthy number for the year. I think it's close to 125%."

So from a financial standpoint, Cai, it's very, very straightforward. I mean you look at our -- there's -- and I think we said this in our press release, about $80 million of net cash outflow that we make to our JV partners there, both minority and the family, the small individual shareowners and the institutional shareholders and the family combined. So that's about $80 million.
Now if we -- so that, obviously, that's something that we don't have to make once we have full ownership of Zardoya. And then we will borrow. As you said, our intention is to borrow in Europe. So we'll do the borrowing in Europe. And so that is where if you net the 2 out, we expect mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023.
Now in 2022, it's going to be less than that. Because the fact is it's going to take us a few months here, we just filed the prospectus. It's going to take 3 to 4 months for that filing to get approved, then we launch the tender, then there's a delisting period and it may take us time to ramp up to the full ownership. So there's going to be a staggered increase in our ownership. And that is where I think we said in the press release, we expect maybe $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion in 2022, just given the timing of the close and the timing of acquisition of shares. So those 2 things will get us to $0.04 -- I think we said $0.04 to $0.06 in the press release. So somewhere in that range for '22 and then mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Hopefully, that answers the question, Cai. And then maybe, Judy, do you want talk about the operational."

Those clauses are resident in those contracts and have been there for many, many years. We just haven't been able to exercise them. So we will certainly try to flow through service price increases, and we'll see what the market will bear there, but we have the ability to do that. And the majority of them are indexed to labor, but there's some small portion that are indexed to material or commodities. Again, we haven't had that opportunity.

And on New Equipment, again, I think we've said that before, we expect some commodity headwinds next year, John, on the New Equipment side. We do -- given where the commodity prices were in the first half of this year, we expect first half of next year to kind of be in the same range as where we were in the second half of this year, so call it $30 million to $35 million a quarter. So maybe $70 million for the first half.
And then beyond that, if you look at the commodity forwards today, they start going the other way starting May, June of '22. And we start -- right now, the forwards would project that there will be a tailwind in the second half of next year, but it's too early to call that. 
But again, go back to -- our thesis is going to be that for next year, we can continue driving earnings expansion both -- in both segments, New Equipment coming from higher volume, given where Judy said that we have a plan to ending the backlog. It's kind of in that low single-digit growth range. So we'll continue to drive revenue growth on the New Equipment segment with incremental, some help from pricing that we've already put in place and our continued execution on installation. We think we can use all that to offset any commodity headwinds in the first half and drive earnings expansion. And on Service, I think our pricing should be a tailwind for next year given where prices are. And the volume should accelerate to kind of more mid-single-digit growth, which is what we expect."

So we continue to push really, really hard on that.
In addition, we've been driving installation efficiency, so that means better project closeouts and ending the project at a higher margin than what we booked at. And that includes both using fewer hours to install the product and taking cost out of the material. Because not the entire material cost comes from the fact that there's incremental material procurement that happens in the field. So we've been spending a lot of time and effort to understand where the supply base is and how we can take cost out of that. So that has been the major push here, and that is where you're seeing. 
And again, we are in early stages of that. We just started it. We saw good results in Q2. We saw good results in Q3. So we're in early stages of that, and we need that installation efficiency to continue to get better as we get into '22. So that will be a push for us. 
And on service productivity, which again, has been a tailwind for us, despite catch-up of maintenance hours and all the COVID-related headwinds that we are absorbing, our Q3 hours are still down year-over-year to maintain an elevator.

Maybe I can just start with China again on your Slide 16. Just help me understand, when you talk about the 3% of China sales, is that both your direct and indirect of your total exposure to those property developers? So including sales via third-party distributors or whatever it might be. I guess the reason I'm asking just maybe to open up, so I'm interested to hear your thoughts is that the risk here might not just be with potentially an ever grand or whoever going bust but actually that it causes distress in the distribution network in China and that you have exposure to distributors who might be put at risk if some of these guys go under. So yes, just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that in terms of what this 3% number is, just to clarify that."

And again, that goes back, Nick, to all the discussion we've -- Joel, that we've had on this call around our expectations for the China market. So not to rehash all of that, but we do expect that this is going to be -- we do expect the China elevator and escalator market to be more flattish next year. So that's our current expectation, and -- but this 3% is our total exposure to these customers."

And then maybe just one final one quickly, which was just on your comments around modernization, which I thought were interesting. It sounds like you're slightly tempering your expectations for the fourth quarter in terms of modernization. Do you think that there is -- there are sort of bottlenecks here, like some of these issues are likely to result in some pent-up demand being released in 2022? I'm just interested, for example, your comments about EMEA being sort of delayed decision-making, whether or not that's likely to sort of come through faster maybe next year."

The challenge on mod it is somewhat more bespoke than New Equipment and custom. And that, at least in the Americas, has created a little bit of a supply chain challenge for us. So we're dealing with it. I think we've appropriately tempered the fourth quarter to the low end of the Service guidance for that region. But we don't see this or the EMEA demand or the Asia Pacific demand going away by any point. Modernization is going to continue to grow. And we know what we need to do. If you look all-in year-to-date, our orders are up 4.3% and our sales are up 2.7%. So we think the fourth quarter reflects that kind of knowledge as well as what we're experiencing and '22 should be stronger."
