Diamondback continued to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's stra",1202,"Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. Diamondback continued to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's strategy to move activity to our most productive areas in the second quarter of 2020 is now starting to pay dividends in terms of capital efficiency and early time well performance. Well costs and cash operating costs remain near all-time lows, and our average completed lateral length in the fourth quarter was over 13,000 lateral feet, a company record. These operational achievements will translate directly into increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months. 
We are still operating in a market supported by supply that's being purposefully withheld to allow global inventories to decline as demand recovers from the depths of the global pandemic. Diamondback continues to see no need to grow oil production into this artificially undersupplied market and instead, plans to hold fourth quarter 2020 production flat while generating free cash flow used to pay our dividend and pay down debt. The Board's decision to increase our dividend by 7% exhibits its confidence in the forward development plan released today, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged: hold production flat in the most capital-efficient manner, with free cash flow used for our dividend and to pay down debt. Growing our dividend and paying down debt are not mutually exclusive, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used for debt pay down in 2021. 
The fourth quarter of 2020 built on the momentum started in the third quarter with free cash flow increasing to over $242 million, up 58% from the $153 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter last year. We expect this trend to continue in 2021, where we currently expect to generate nearly $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 oil pro forma for the closing of our acquisition of Guidon this Friday. This free cash flow implies a reinvestment ratio below 60% at $50 oil and the midpoint of our $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion capital budget for this year. Note that our CapEx guidance includes the addition of approximately $100 million of capital for the guide on acquisition, which encompasses one net operated rig added as well as associated infrastructure and environmental spend. 
Our production guidance that ties to this capital budget for 2021 and assumes that we hold Diamondback's expected fourth quarter oil production of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day flat, plus 10 months of the 12,000 barrels of oil per day that Guidon was producing at time of acquisition announcement. This production guidance also accounts for the estimated impact of the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin last week, which we estimate to have knocked out the equivalent of 100% of our production for 4 to 5 days. Production has nearly returned to pre-storm levels as of today, and we expect to make up a majority of the lost production throughout the year, but will not be able to make it all up in the first quarter. 
The stockholder meeting to vote on our pending merger with QEP Resources is scheduled for March 16. The merger is expected to close shortly thereafter, subject to QEP stockholder approval. Should the deal approve, we will update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable after closing. While this creates a noisy first quarter in terms of production additions, it will also create a clean look at the pro forma business in the second quarter and beyond. 
We have only one material term debt maturity due in the next 4 years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note when it is callable at par later this year. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due 2025 that's currently callable, providing optionality for further gross debt reduction as free cash flow materializes. 
Turning to ESG. Diamondback today announced a major initiative relating to ESG performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emissions intensity reduction targets as well as a commitment to point forward Scope 1 carbon neutrality or Net Zero Now. We are committing to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024, and we are committing to reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% from 2019 levels, also by 2024. A detailed breakdown of our Scope 1 and methane emissions from 2019 can be seen on Pages 13 and 14 of our latest investor presentation. 
Diamondback expects to continue to reduce flaring, which is now down almost 90% from 2019 levels, directly impacting over 50% of our 2019 Scope 1 emissions. We also expect to spend approximately $15 million a year over the next 4 years to retrofit about 600 of our tank batteries with air-powered pneumatic control systems, replacing methane-emitting gas-operated pneumatic control systems. These 2 changes will be significant drivers in reducing our carbon footprint, but other initiatives like methane leak detection and full field electrification will also have a direct impact on our emissions reduction strategy. 
Diamondback today also announced the Net Zero Now initiative, which means that as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to be produced with zero net Scope 1 emissions. The GHG and methane intensity reduction targets mentioned earlier are the primary focus as it relates to our environmental responsibility, but we recognize we will still have a carbon footprint. Therefore, carbon offset credits will be purchased to offset our remaining emissions. Eventually, we expect Diamondback or one of our subsidiaries to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset our remaining Scope 1 emissions, but the credits are a bridge to that time and place. 
With these major announcements, Diamondback has chosen to adopt a strategy to operate with the highest level of environmental responsibility. Our social and environmental license to operate as a public oil and gas company based in the United States is going to be influenced by our capital providers, and we do not expect our investor pressure for oil and gas companies to improve their environmental performance to subside anytime soon. It is incumbent on us to improve our environmental performance and compete for capital in an industry with ever-increasing external pressures. Carbon emissions are a cost, and Diamondback is working to become the low-carbon operator in addition to our leadership position as the operator with the lowest capital and operating cost. 
I'm very excited about Diamondback's current position and the strength of our forward outlook as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase announced yesterday. We are forecasting significant, consistent free cash flow generation translating into returns to shareholders. We look forward to successfully closing and integrating the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, and we'll update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable. 
With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions."

On a pro forma basis, in our model, which includes QEP, we calculate about $1.4 billion of after dividend free cash flow over the next 5 years. And I think your dividend is about $300 million, so call it $1.4 million after the dividend or $7 billion. You guys talked about today paying off a little less than $200 million of debt due later this year, plus funding the $375 million of cash from the Guidon acquisition. And then also it sounds like leaning into the dividend on a go-forward basis is something you plan on. But I guess our broader question is what are your plans on a longer-term basis in terms of deploying this excess cash?"

But at the Board level, we consistently talk about leaning into the base dividend and continuing to enhance our shareholder -- as a form -- as a way of enhancing our shareholder return program. And it's really, like I said, a problem of blessings to have that kind of free cash flow. We want to continue to work the debt quantum down, which we intend to do so. And we'll do like we've always done and be creative in returning that money back to our shareholders. I've been very demonstrative in our stance of not trying to grow production. So any fears that we're going to take money and start drilling more wells with it this year is just off the table. So it's a good problem to have."

We know that the service industry has suffered through this downturn as much as anybody, if not more. And there are some pricing pressures at the margin. I wouldn't say it's on the big-ticket items, but you are starting to see some pressure on casing prices and smaller field service items. So like we talked about, the midpoint of our guide is 8% to 10% above where well costs are today. I would hope the good guys can keep some of that on our side and outperform as we go through the year. But just being conservative on today, February 23, and we've got 10 more months left of, hopefully, $55-plus oil, and that will result in some service cost pressures."

Neal, I mean, we had a pretty high flaring number in 2019, and it was pretty frustrating to us that, that number was as high as it was. Unfortunately, it was that high because we had a gas processor who had a percent of proceeds contract that was losing money on that contract, and therefore, it wasn't very fair on how much they sent us to flare versus some of their other contracts. So we took that price risk and decided to restructure that contract into a fixed fee deal. And you can see in the flaring numbers, our numbers have come down dramatically, mostly because of that particular contract moving to fixed fee. Now with NGLs and gas rallying, that fixed fee stays the same, and we get the benefit as the operator. So that's helping a lot. I don't think it had a lot of impact on -- from a storm perspective. I think our field organization during the storm actually stepped up to get power -- or get natural gas flowing back to local power plants in the Permian, which eased the problem and stopped the rolling blackouts in the Permian almost immediately. So 2 separate items, but certainly proud of the field organization for what they did for the cities of Midland and Odessa."

It was a great opportunity with less field activity going on to really examine all of the processes, both on the drilling and completion side and on the production side as well. And so we took advantage of that trough in activity. And as the industry picked back up and as our activity picked back up, we were able to kind of make permanent some of those efficiencies that we revealed through the second quarter and early third quarter.

I think the Net Zero Now initiative is a great addition to the story, but it's not the primary focus. And the primary focus happens to be working down all the numbers you see on Slide 13 and 14. And so the big dollars we're going to spend, we're going to spend about $15 million a year converting legacy gas pneumatic tank batteries to air. And those batteries run off methane, essentially, and converting that to air dramatically reduces your methane intensity automatically. So I'd expect to see $15 million a year in the budget for that, and we've also built that in on the Guidon in QP acreage as we get a hold of that and look to convert that. The carbon credits, we've already -- are in process on a contract for some carbon credits. I won't give all the details, but I'll say it's a mid 7-figure number, not an 8-figure number.

And again, I just go back to our environmental and social license and trying to do the right thing here."

What we've seen in the past, Jeff, when we go through one of these cycles of rapid commodity price increases, names that you would have thought would have come off the board -- public names that would have come off the board, probably now have a lot greater runway with the higher commodity price. So usually, when you see these kinds of cycles accelerate, it makes, from a macro perspective, A&D harder to do. But just like Kaes was saying, though, we've got Guidon and soon to be QEP to roll in the mix, and we're very comfortable with where our inventory sits right now in terms of runway in front of us. So I just want to add that in as well."

But from a macro perspective, what I'm seeing is that we still are undersupplied on rigs to keep the Permian Basin flat. So you may see some rig adds coming, but right now, it's probably not enough to offset the production declines that we've seen through the lack of investment over the last 12 months. So I believe, and maybe I'm the internal optimist, but I believe if moving through the depths of a global apocalypse that was created by this pandemic, if oil and gas companies haven't got discipline now, they probably never will. So I'm optimistic that the industry is going to tow the line on capital discipline, irrespective of commodity prices. Now there will be some time in the future, a signal when supply has worked off and Iranian barrels are absorbed and surplus OPEC capacities has consumed that the world will be signaling for growth. But as we tried to articulate earlier, the days of hyper growth in the shale industry should be part of our history, not part of our future. 
But I'll tell you, just adding to that, and I know you guys get tired of hearing me talk about our operations and our low cost. But as the low-cost producer, almost irrespective of commodity price, we're going to drive the highest returns to our shareholders."

I think, like Travis said, the main thing is the main thing, and that's we're an oil and gas producer that's going to be producing here for a long time.

So our focus is not to try to buy our way into carbon neutrality. Our focus is how can we invest to eliminate our Scope 1 emissions. And the carbon credits now provide us a bridge, and quite honestly, provides us an incentive because I don't like spending that money, but it provides us an incentive to get the operations in the shape that they need to be. And that's what we need for our shareholders, and that's what our industry needs as well, too.

But certainly, we're very cognizant of the multiples that, that side of the business gets versus an oil and gas company right now, but that's not the reason why we're doing this."

Occasionally, I'll use my closing remarks to add a message that's kind of directed towards our organization and a message I think sometimes important for our investors to hear that separates from sort of the standard quarter. This past week, as we're all acutely aware of, the Permian Basin experienced unprecedented weather event. We had over 220 hours of below freezing weather. And really across the Permian Basin, we had extended periods of no electricity and water supplies frozen and really, against all of that, we had a frozen and a dark oilfield. And our field organization, and in some cases, these individuals working over 20 hours a day, they were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants. They weren't working to get Diamondback's volumes flowing and back online earlier because of our quarterly objectives. They were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants that were -- honestly, that were sitting idle, particularly on the West side of Odessa. And they were sitting idle because they didn't have any fuel. And through our efforts and other operators' efforts, gas was delivered and Texas had power. This occurred Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning. And by Thursday, most of Texas, again, had power. And it's -- I just want to -- the efforts that were displayed by many individuals in the Permian Basin transcends normal procedures for returning production in the Permian Basin is grateful for -- we're really grateful for everything that you guys did.

The benefits of the company's stra",1196,"Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. Diamondback continued to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's strategy to move activity to our most productive areas in the second quarter of 2020 is now starting to pay dividends in terms of capital efficiency and early-time well performance. 
Well costs and cash operating costs remain near all-time lows, and our average completed lateral length in the fourth quarter was over 13,000 lateral feet, a company record. These operational achievements will translate directly into increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months. 
We are still operating in a market supported by supply that's being purposefully withheld to allow global inventories to decline as demand recovers from the depths of the global pandemic. Diamondback continues to see no need to grow oil production into this artificially undersupplied market and instead plans to hold fourth quarter 2020 production flat while generating free cash flow used to pay our dividend and pay down debt. 
The Board's decision to increase our dividend by 7% exhibits its confidence in the forward development plan released today, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged: Hold production flat in the most capital-efficient manner, with free cash flow used for our dividend and to pay down debt. Growing our dividend and paying down debt are not mutually exclusive, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used for debt paydown in 2021. 
The fourth quarter of 2020 built on the momentum started in the third quarter, with free cash flow increasing to over $242 million, up 58% from the $153 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter last year. We expect this trend to continue in 2021, where we currently expect to generate nearly $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 oil pro forma for the closing of our acquisition of Guidon this Friday. 
This free cash flow implies a reinvestment ratio below 60% at $50 oil in the midpoint of our $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion capital budget for this year. Note that our CapEx guidance includes the addition of approximately $100 million of capital for the Guidon acquisition, which encompasses one net operated rig added as well as associated infrastructure and environmental spend. 
Our production guidance that ties to this capital budget for 2021 assumes that we hold Diamondback's expected fourth quarter oil production of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day flat, plus 10 months of the 12,000 barrels of oil per day that Guidon was producing at time of acquisition announcement. 
This production guidance also accounts for the estimated impact of the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin last week, which we estimate to have knocked out the equivalent of 100% of our production for 4 to 5 days. Production has nearly returned to pre-storm levels as of today, and we expect to make up a majority of the lost production throughout the year, but will not be able to make it all up in the first quarter. 
The stockholder meeting to vote on our pending merger with QEP Resources is scheduled for March 16. The merger is expected to close shortly thereafter, subject to QEP stockholder approval. Should the deal approve, we will update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable after closing. While this creates a noisy first quarter in terms of production additions, it will also create a clean look at the pro forma business in the second quarter and beyond. 
We have only one material term debt maturity due in the next 4 years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note when it is callable at par later this year. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due 2025 that's currently callable, providing optionality for further gross debt reduction as free cash flow materializes. 
Turning to ESG. Diamondback today announced a major initiative relating to ESG performance and disclosure, including scope 1 and methane emissions intensity reduction targets, as well as a commitment to point forward Scope 1 carbon neutrality or Net Zero Now. We are committing to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024, and we are committing to reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% from 2019 levels, also by 2024. A detailed breakdown of our Scope 1 and methane emissions from 2019 can be seen on Pages 13 and 14 of our latest investor presentation. 
Diamondback expects to continue to reduce flaring, which is now down almost 90% from 2019 levels, directly impacting over 50% of our 2019 Scope 1 emissions. We also expect to spend approximately $15 million a year over the next 4 years to retrofit about 600 of our tank batteries with air-powered pneumatic control systems, replacing methane-emitting, gas-operated pneumatic control systems. These 2 changes will be significant drivers in reducing our carbon footprint, but other initiatives like methane leak detection and full-field electrification will also have a direct impact on our emissions reduction strategy. 
Diamondback today also announced the Net Zero Now initiative, which means as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to be produced with zero net Scope 1 emissions. The GHG and methane intensity reduction targets mentioned earlier are the primary focus as it relates to our environmental responsibility. 
But we recognize we will still have a carbon footprint. Therefore, carbon offset credits will be purchased to offset our remaining emissions. Eventually, we expect Diamondback or one of our subsidiaries to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset our remaining Scope 1 emissions, but the credits are a bridge to that time and place. 
With these major announcements, Diamondback has chosen to adopt a strategy to operate with the highest level of environmental responsibility. Our social and environmental license to operate as a public oil and gas company based in the United States is going to be influenced by our capital providers, and we do not expect our investor pressure for oil and gas companies to improve their environmental performance to subside anytime soon. 
It is incumbent on us to improve our environmental performance and compete for capital in an industry with ever-increasing external pressures. Carbon emissions are a cost, and Diamondback is working to become the low-carbon operator in addition to our leadership position as the operator with the lowest capital and operating cost. 
I'm very excited about Diamondback's current position and the strength of our forward outlook as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase announced yesterday. We are forecasting significant, consistent free cash flow generation translating into returns to shareholders. We look forward to successfully closing and integrating the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, and we'll update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable. 
With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions."

And I think your dividend is about $300 million, so call it $1.4 million after the dividend or $7 billion. 
You guys talked about today paying off a little less than $200 million of debt due later this year, plus funding the $375 million of cash from the Guidon acquisition. And then also it sounds like leaning into the dividend on a go-forward basis is something you plan on. But I guess our broader question is what are your plans on a longer-term basis in terms of deploying this excess cash?"

First, the operating metrics of the company continue to just look outstanding. So I'm really excited about that, and we've evidenced it now for a couple of quarters. 
But at the Board level, we consistently talk about leaning into the base dividend and continuing to enhance our shareholder -- as a form -- as a way of enhancing our shareholder return program. And it's really, like I said, a problem of blessings to have that kind of free cash flow. 
We want to continue to work the debt quantum down, which we intend to do so. And we'll do like we've always done and be creative in returning that money back to our shareholders. I've been very demonstrative in our stance of not trying to grow production. So any fears that we're going to take money and start drilling more wells with it this year is just off the table.

I wouldn't say it's on the big-ticket items, but you are starting to see some pressure on casing prices and smaller field service items. 
So like we talked about, the midpoint of our guide is 8% to 10% above where well costs are today. I would hope the good guys can keep some of that on our side and outperform as we go through the year. But just being conservative. Today is February 23 and we've got 10 more months left of, hopefully, $55-plus oil, and that will result in some service cost pressures."

Neal, I mean, we had a pretty high flaring number in 2019, and it was pretty frustrating to us that, that number was as high as it was. Unfortunately, it was that high because we had a gas processor who had a percent of proceeds contract that was losing money on that contract, and therefore, it wasn't very fair on how much they sent us to flare versus some of their other contracts. So we took that price risk and decided to restructure that contract into a fixed fee deal. And you can see in the flaring numbers, our numbers have come down dramatically, mostly because of that particular contract moving to fixed fee. 
Now with NGLs and gas rally, that fixed fee stays the same and we get the benefit as the operator. So that's helping a lot. I don't think it had a lot of impact on -- from a storm perspective. I think our field organization during the storm actually stepped up to get power -- or get natural gas flowing back to local power plants in the Permian, which eased the problem and stopped the rolling blackouts in the Permian almost immediately. So 2 separate items, but certainly proud of the field organization for what they did for the cities of Midland and Odessa."

It was a great opportunity with less field activity going on to really examine all of the processes, both on the drilling and completion side and on the production side as well. 
And so we took advantage of that trough in activity. And as the industry picked back up and as our activity picked back up, we were able to kind of make permanent some of those efficiencies that we revealed through the second quarter and early third quarter.

The carbon credits, we've already -- are in process on a contract for some carbon credits. I won't give all the details, but I'll say it's a mid-7-figure number, not an 8-figure number. And the projects that we're investing in are tied directly to carbon capture or carbon sequestration rather than the tree planting side of the business."

And spending money on tax credits actually provides us a great incentive to not use those by doing the right things out in the field, like Kaes was mentioning and articulating, to effectuate these changes. And it's a nice bridge in the interim, but that's not the focus of what this initiative is about."

So I think, overall, if you look at our hedge book, we've tried to keep very wide 2-way collars. We're at the bottom end of our collars. We're protecting our dividend and protecting -- paying down some near-term maturities, but also trying not to limit all the upside to our shareholders. 
So I think you'll see us keep building that hedge book with wide collars. I think the percent hedge that we have is inverted just like the forward curve, and I think we're going to be patient adding hedges.

And we've done that work. I still think we're a ways away from it, but we've proven that we can grow in the past.

We have some small stuff that we would look to sell in the Permian that's fully developed that doesn't compete for capital and that market looks pretty good. So we're excited about A&D. I think from a consolidation perspective, a lot of big consolidation happened in 2020, obviously.

So I believe, and maybe I'm the eternal optimist, but I believe if moving through the depths of a global apocalypse that was created by this pandemic, if oil and gas companies haven't got discipline now, they probably never will. So I'm optimistic that the industry is going to tow the line on capital discipline, irrespective of commodity prices. 
Now there will be, sometime in the future, a signal when supply has worked off and Iranian barrels are absorbed and surplus OPEC capacities has consumed that the world will be signaling for growth. But as we tried to articulate earlier, the days of hyper growth in the shale industry should be part of our history, not part of our future.

This past week, as we're all acutely aware of, the Permian Basin experienced unprecedented weather event. We had over 220 hours of below-freezing weather. And really across the Permian Basin, we had extended periods of no electricity and water supplies frozen and really, against all of that, we had a frozen and a dark oilfield. And our field organization, and in some cases, these individuals working over 20 hours a day, they were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants. They weren't working to get Diamondback's volumes flowing and back online earlier because of our quarterly objectives. They were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants that were -- honestly, that were sitting idle, particularly on the west side of Odessa. And they were sitting idle because they didn't have any fuel. 
And through our efforts and other operators' efforts, gas was delivered and Texas had power. This occurred Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning. And by Thursday, most of Texas, again, had power. And it's -- I just want to -- the efforts that were displayed by many individuals in the Permian Basin transcends normal procedures for returning production. And the Permian Basin is grateful for -- we're really grateful for everything that you guys did. You answered the call and you put forth a heroic effort that will not be forgotten. Just want to tell you publicly, thank you for everything that you guys did.

Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to",825,"Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings Call. Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to effectively navigate a once-in-a-generation winter storm while keeping well costs and cash operating costs near all-time lows. We closed both the Guidon and QEP acquisitions in the first quarter and are very pleased with how the integration efforts are progressing. We are achieving our synergy targets ahead of schedule and in excess of the $60 million to $80 million of annual cost savings we highlighted when the deals were announced.
Yesterday, we also announced 3 noncore asset divestitures for gross expected proceeds of $832 million. By selling these noncore acreage positions in such a timely and opportunistic manner, we were able to take advantage of a strong A&D market and generate attractive cash returns for Diamondback shareholders. We anticipate using the combined proceeds from these noncore asset sales to accelerate debt reduction.
As we discussed last quarter, even though oil demand has shown signs of recovery from the depths of the global pandemic, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, primarily through the actions of OPEC+. As a result, we continue to believe we do not need production growth and will hold our pro forma fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat through 2021.
Due to the complexity resulting from the timing of the QEP and Guidon acquisitions as well as the announced divestitures, we have instituted quarterly production and capital guidance for the first time. For the second quarter, we anticipate spending $350 million to $400 million in capital and producing 232,000 to 236,000 barrels of oil a day. This production range accounts for a full quarter of contribution from QEP's Williston asset and approximately 2 months of production from the announced noncore Permian asset sales.
Looking at the full year of 2021, our free cash flow profile continues to improve. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $330 million of free cash flow, marking the third consecutive quarter of significant free cash generation. At current strip pricing and accounting for the Williston divestiture we expect to generate approximately $1.4 billion in pre-dividend free cash flow this year at a reinvestment ratio of below 55%.
In March, we executed a successful tender offer and refinancing of all of QEP bonds and 1 of Diamondback's existing bonds. This refinancing equates to $40 million of annual interest expense savings and extended our average debt maturity by 3 years. Today, we have 3 debt maturities that are callable before the end of this year. $191 million due later this year, $650 million due in 2023 and $432 million due in 2025. We expect to use cash on hand from internally generated cash flow as well as proceeds from our asset sales to retire these 3 tranches of bonds, reducing our absolute debt load and further strengthening our balance sheet.
Now turning to ESG. We recognize the importance of operating with the highest level of environmental responsibility and we continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We flared 0.75% of our gross gas production in the first quarter. a decrease of over 85% from 2019. Flaring is the biggest driver of our CO2 emissions. And while we are happy with our progress on our legacy acreage, we still have significant work to do on our recently acquired positions as we move to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024.
We've also committed to reducing our methane intensity by 70% over the same time frame. In the first quarter, we continued spending capital to retrofit our older tank batteries with air pneumatic devices as gas pneumatics account for 50% of our methane emissions. We also signed a contract to conduct quarterly flyovers of all of our tank batteries to more frequently check for equipment leaks, improving our maintenance practices.
Our Net Zero Now initiative is also underway, which means every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback than anticipated to have 0 net Scope 1 carbon emissions from January 1, 2021 forward. While we recognize we still had a carbon footprint, we have already purchased carbon credits to offset remaining emissions and ultimately plan to be a fast follower in investing in income-generating projects here in the United States that will more directly offset these remaining Scope 1 emissions.
To finish, the first quarter was busy and productive. We generated substantial free cash flow, kept our capital and operating costs down, extended debt maturities, added Tier 1 inventory and divested noncore assets. All the while, our strategy remains the same. operate in a prudent and sustainable manner, spend maintenance capital to hold production flat and use future free cash flow to return cash to shareholders and reduce debt.

And I've actually been really pleased with -- as that pace was reduced, in some cases, dramatically last year, even as we've entered into this year, we really seem to be at a pretty efficient frontier in both rig activity and frac spreads with 11 rigs and 3 to 4 frac spreads.

So that -- I think that piece of the A&D still seems to be pretty frothy, particularly on the PDP-focused type of divestitures, a lot of interest in that.
But specific to what Diamondback is looking for on a go-forward basis, we still remain very resolute in our strategy that it's got to meet internal objectives like free cash flow, and it's got to be return accretive on a per share basis. And when you look at the combination, we've got to accelerate return of free cash flow. The larger trades that particular ones that you referenced, it's the quality of assets that fit for capital in Diamondback's top quartile or probably fewer than greater. And the prices that were recently announced on some of those trades might have coiled some of the activity for a little while anyway.
But I think as long as we can demonstrate that were being accretive on a per share basis and that we're accelerating return of free cash flow. We're going to continue to look in the Permian Basin, but the opportunity sets pretty narrow right now."

I think it's good for our industry that we continue to talk about investors recouping a return for the money that they've asked us to deploy. I think that's good for our industry. And you're right about reaching certain debt targets and these announcements that we laid out yesterday to simply accelerate the time frame at which we can hit those debt targets.
I think the callable debt reduction of $1.2 billion or more by the end of this year is going to put us in a favorable position to start talking about what the next step is. I also think that our industry has seen a lot of interest in laying out a formula for how capital allocation is going to go or capital allocation and returns to shareholders is going to go. And I wished that our industry was as simple that you could put a formula in place, and formulas work as long as the world doesn't change. But in our business and a commodity-based business, we know that our world does change. So I'm always a little leery of trying to promise delivery on a formula when we know the world is going to change.
But the options are very clear. The strategy around the variable dividend is part of the future discussions at the Board level as is share buybacks. And most importantly, like we've always committed to continue to lean into our base dividend. So we're very pleased that we're able to accelerate our debt reduction targets with kind of a very positive divestiture number. And we're going to continue to deliver on -- through our performance and try to avoid making promises multiple quarters in front of us."

Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to",824,"Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to effectively navigate a once-in-a-generation winter storm while keeping well costs and cash operating costs near all-time lows. We closed both the Guidon and QEP acquisitions in the first quarter and are very pleased with how the integration efforts are progressing. We are achieving our synergy targets ahead of schedule and in excess of the $60 million to $80 million of annual cost savings we highlighted when the deals were announced.
Yesterday, we also announced 3 noncore asset divestitures for gross expected proceeds of $832 million. By selling these noncore acreage positions in such a timely and opportunistic manner, we were able to take advantage of a strong A&D market and generate attractive cash returns for Diamondback shareholders. We anticipate using the combined proceeds from these noncore asset sales to accelerate debt reduction.
As we discussed last quarter, even though oil demand has shown signs of recovery from the depths of the global pandemic, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, primarily through the actions of OPEC+. As a result, we continue to believe we do not need production growth and will hold our pro forma fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat through 2021.
Due to the complexity resulting from the timing of the QEP and Guidon acquisitions as well as the announced divestitures, we have instituted quarterly production and capital guidance for the first time. For the second quarter, we anticipate spending $350 million to $400 million in capital and producing 232,000 to 236,000 barrels of oil a day. This production range accounts for a full quarter of contribution from QEP's Williston asset and approximately 2 months of production from the announced noncore Permian asset sales.
Looking at the full year of 2021, our free cash flow profile continues to improve. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $330 million of free cash flow, marking the third consecutive quarter of significant free cash generation. At current strip pricing and accounting for the Williston divestiture, we expect to generate approximately $1.4 billion in pre-dividend free cash flow this year at a reinvestment ratio of below 55%. 
In March, we executed a successful tender offer and refinancing of all of QEP bonds and one of Diamondback's existing bonds. This refinancing equates to $40 million of annual interest expense savings and extended our average debt maturity by 3 years. Today, we have 3 debt maturities that are callable before the end of this year: $191 million due later this year, $650 million due in 2023 and $432 million due in 2025. We expect to use cash on hand from internally generated cash flow as well as proceeds from our asset sales to retire these 3 tranches of bonds, reducing our absolute debt load and further strengthening our balance sheet.
Now turning to ESG. We recognize the importance of operating with the highest level of environmental responsibility and continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We flared 0.75% of our gross gas production in the first quarter, a decrease of over 85% from 2019. Flaring is the biggest driver of our CO2 emissions. And while we are happy with our progress on our legacy acreage, we still have significant work to do on our recently acquired positions as we move to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024.
We've also committed to reducing our methane intensity by 70% over the same time frame. In the first quarter, we continued spending capital to retrofit our older tank batteries with air pneumatic devices as gas pneumatics account for 50% of our methane emissions. We also signed a contract to conduct quarterly flyovers of all of our tank batteries to more frequently check for equipment leaks, improving our maintenance practices.
Our Net Zero Now initiative is also underway, which means every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have 0 net Scope 1 carbon emissions from January 1, 2021 forward. While we recognize we still had a carbon footprint, we have already purchased carbon credits to offset remaining emissions and ultimately plan to be a fast follower in investing in income-generating projects here in the United States that will more directly offset these remaining Scope 1 emissions.
To finish, the first quarter was busy and productive. We generated substantial free cash flow, kept our capital and operating costs down, extended debt maturities, added Tier 1 inventory and divested noncore assets. All the while, our strategy remains the same: operate in a prudent and sustainable manner, spend maintenance capital to hold production flat and use future free cash flow to return cash to shareholders and reduce debt.

Certainly, that narrative hasn't changed at all. In fact, it's probably gotten a little bit better. And I'll tell you, I was very complementary of the QEP team at acquisition announcement time and again, during our February call and our April update. Operationally, they were doing some really efficient things. And just looking at the drilling report this morning, QEP's always use water-based mud. And Diamondback now, we've adopted it and we're on our first or second well with water-based drilling fluids that quite honestly, QEP is helping us with. And so far, really, really impressed with the improved efficiency using water-based mud. So that's been a nice add to what I thought was already a really efficient Diamondback legacy operations team. This looks to be a little bit of a stairstep in the right direction."

But specific to what Diamondback is looking for on a go-forward basis, we still remain very resolute in our strategy that it's got to meet internal objectives like free cash flow, and it's got to be return accretive on a per share basis. And when you look at the combination, we've got to accelerate return of free cash flow.
The larger trades that -- particularly the ones that you referenced, it's -- the quality of assets that fit for capital in Diamondback's top quartile are probably fewer than greater. And the prices that were recently announced on some of those trades might have coiled some of the activity for a little while anyway. But I think as long as we can demonstrate that were being accretive on a per share basis and that we're accelerating return of free cash flow, we're going to continue to look in the Permian Basin.

And you're right about reaching certain debt targets and these announcements that we laid out yesterday to simply accelerate the time frame at which we can hit those debt targets.
I think the callable debt reduction of $1.2 billion or more by the end of this year is going to put us in a favorable position to start talking about what the next step is. I also think that our industry has seen a lot of interest in laying out a formula for how capital allocation is going to go or capital allocation and returns to shareholders is going to go. And I wish that our industry was as simple that you could put a formula in place, and formulas work as long as the world doesn't change. But in our business and a commodity-based business, we know that our world does change. So I'm always a little leery of trying to promise delivery on a formula when we know the world is going to change.
But the options are very clear. The strategy around the variable dividend is part of the future discussions at the Board level, as is share buybacks, and most importantly, like we've always committed to, continue to lean into our base dividend. So we're very pleased that we're able to accelerate our debt reduction targets with kind of a very positive divestiture number.

But the ancillary stuff, environmental, infrastructure, midstream, non-op is going to pick up a bit in the middle of the second half of the year, and that, on top of the couple of quarters of true pro forma QEP and Guidon and Diamondback activity, will result in capital coming up slightly throughout the year.

But I think for us, anything else that's a sale candidate in the Permian has real undeveloped value, and that's not something we're looking to sell right now because I think the market for that is less competitive than a PDP-heavy market."

And there are things that -- there's new technology emerging, and we're trying to stay abreast of it.

Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter, extending its track record of operational excellence. I am proud of everything our team has been able to accomplish this year by pus",1141,"Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's Second Quarter Earnings Call. Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter, extending its track record of operational excellence. I am proud of everything our team has been able to accomplish this year by pushing the boundaries of our current thought processes and embracing new technologies and playbooks, many of which have come from the personnel we've added through our acquisitions. Nowhere is that more evident than on the drilling and completion side of the business where we continue to lower costs and improve cycle times. We've decreased our drill times from spud to total depth by over 30% and are averaging just over 10 days to drill a 2-mile well in the Permian -- in the Midland Basin. 
On the completion side, we're now running 3 simul frac crews, which lower our downtime and improve our pad efficiencies. We are currently completing approximately 2,800 lateral feet per day in the Midland Basin, an improvement of nearly 70% as compared to our early zipper frac designs. All of these operational advances translate to our ability to do more with less. 
While we are seeing some inflation on diesel, steel and other materials, our ability to continually improve operationally and become more efficient, has more than offset these cost increases and our leading-edge DC&E costs continue to be at the low end of our guidance range. As a result, we are decreasing the number of rigs and crews we need to execute this year's capital plan and are reducing our full year capital guidance by $100 million or down 6% from prior expectations. 
On the production side, our wells have outperformed expectations this year. As a result, we are slightly increasing our Permian oil production guidance, which should not be taken as a conscious decision to grow. As we look at supply and demand fundamentals, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, and we continue to believe that there's not a call on U.S. shale production growth. We will continue, therefore, to target flat oil production for the foreseeable future and plan to do that by completing less wells than originally planned this year. These operational highlights, coupled with a supportive macro backdrop, led to record free cash flow generation for Diamondback. 
During the second quarter, we generated $578 million in free cash flow or $3.18 per diluted share. To put this into perspective, we entered 2021 anticipating roughly this amount of free cash flow for the full year. We've already put this cash to work by calling and paying down over $600 million of callable debt so far this year with over $600 million more expected later this year when our 2023 notes become callable. In total, this debt reduction will reduce cash interest expense by almost $40 million annually. 
We continue to emphasize that reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns are not mutually exclusive, and we proved this point again by increasing our quarterly dividend by 12.5% from $0.40 a share to $0.45 a share or $1.80 annualized. This puts our year-to-date dividend growth at 20% above 2020 levels. 
At Diamondback, we prefer to talk about our current performance rather than future promises. However, our performance has allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our base dividend. And we now feel it's appropriate to put up some goalposts as it relates to additional return of capital in 2022, given the current free cash flow outlook at strip pricing. 
Our plan is to distribute 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2022. This form of additional capital return will be decided by the Board at the appropriate time but we intend to be flexible based on which opportunities we believe present the best return to our stockholders, the owners of our company. Remember, our strategy is unchanged since 2018 when we initiated our base dividend. This additional clarity is simply an evolution of our guidance and also reflective of the maturation of our business. A lot can happen now between now and the end of the year, but we feel we are well positioned to take advantage of the current commodity price environment and deliver differential free cash flow in 2022. 
Our capital efficiency improvement allows us to maintain an elevated base level of Permian oil production through 2022 by spending approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion of total capital. The continued improvement in our realized pricing and our low cash cost structure combined to form a best-in-class cash margin, which we plan to protect as we layer on hedges that are focused on protecting extreme downside, allowing our shareholders to participate in commodity price upside. 
Turning to ESG. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives.  Flaring continues to be 1 of the biggest drivers of our CO2 emissions. And while we've made significant progress since 2019, we still have work to do. Our target in 2021 is to flare less than 1% of gross gas produced. And in the first half of the year, we were above that number. Now this is primarily due to the integration of the QEP assets, and we expect this metric to improve as we build out additional infrastructure in the Midland Basin and close the Williston divestiture later this quarter. 
We have also begun 2 pilot projects utilizing tankless and limited tank facility designs. While the first tankless facility is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter, we've already had 2 successful limited tank design pilots. On average, this designed our CO2 emissions from our storage tanks by more than 90%. Because of this success, we've elected to extend this pilot to another 5 facilities in the back half of this year and expand to an additional 15 facilities in 2022. 
Lastly, we are continuing to build out our electrical substations, which will help minimize emissions from combustion equipment, primarily generators and gas engine-driven compressors. We are working to remove or replace over 200 of these units by 2023. The combination of these efforts position us well to meet our commitment of reducing our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% as compared to 2019 figures by 2024. 
The second quarter exceeded our expectations and exemplified why Diamondback is a leader in the industry. Our people continue to innovate, making us more environmentally responsible and efficient uniquely positioning us for the future. Our record free cash flow generation allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our dividend all the while positioning us for robust shareholder returns next year. We are delivering on our exploit and return strategy, continuing to focus on maintaining Permian oil volumes, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders.

And when you look at kind of a mid-cycle oil price, and we kind of use [ 15 ] for NGLs and $2 for gas, the NAV of our stock price is much higher than where we are today. 
So if that backdrop persists, best use of our capital is not in the M&A market. It's rather in the in the buy back our own stock. But look, we've been very clear what forms -- what our decision framework and our acquisition frameworks look like, and we've articulated that in every earnings call.

We are going to close the Bakken a little bit later than we expected due to external approvals. And so therefore, we kind of raised our full year guide by about 2,500 barrels a day, which is 2 months of the Bakken contribution. But above that, we also raised our overall guide for the year up 2%, and that's really on an apples-to-apples basis versus our Q1 guide. And really, I think the impetus for that is some Permian outperformance early in the year. And therefore, I think we're comfortable raising our Permian guidance on oil to [ 218 to 222, from 216 to 220. ] And as Travis said, we're not in growth mode, but the wells this year have outperformed, and we've cut more capital on the CapEx side than we have raised the production side. 
So generally, completing 10 fewer wells this year than originally planned in the Permian production up a couple of percent, but more importantly, capital down 6% or 7% from where we were before. And that translates to the 2022 plan, which is in dark pencil right now, but flat is kind of the case we're modeling. And I think generally holding that 218,000 to 222,000 barrels a day in the Permian flat with as little capital as possible is how we see it today. This -- the number we posted yesterday kind of bakes in a little bit of service cost inflation as we know our business partners on that side are going to be able to push price a little bit. But generally, really excited about a high Midland Basin percentage of wells completed next year that keeps production flat in a very capital-efficient manner."

And what that number does over time, look, Neil, I couldn't be more excited about the forward outlook of the company. Even like I said at that mid-cycle oil price and a breakeven cost of around $32 a barrel, we're making a lot of really good free cash flow on a daily basis as we look out in the future. And we'll make that decision when that cash comes through the doors as to what we're going to do with it.

So we didn't have a full quarter of their capital contribution. So that's a portion of the 10% to 15% increase, I'd say about half of it. And also the other half is we did have a nice tough benefit. If you see we're completing 270 wells and drilling 220 this year. So that's about another $100 million benefit because when we were running as many rigs as we were into the downturn, we decided to not pay early termination fees and instead build a DUC backlog, which was the best use of investor dollars at the time, and we're taking advantage of that a little bit this year. 
So I think generally, from a crew and rig count perspective, we dropped 2 rigs this quarter. We'll probably bring those 2 rigs back, but we'll probably need somewhere around 11 or 12 rigs next year and 3 simul-frac crews and maybe a fourth spot crew to execute on that plan. which is a testament to how efficient the operations team has gotten here."

With the shift to the Midland Basin, we are going to need to build out some permanent infrastructure on the recycling side to be able to not only recycle the water, but also store produced water so that we're not using -- our freshwater intensity will go down on the Midland Basin side. That process is underway. I expect that we have a nice solid connected system across kind of our sale, Robertson Ranch and Martin County positioned by the middle to the end of next year, and that's going to allow us to up that number significantly. 
So we've used 100% recycled water in the Delaware Basin. Usually, you're just pulling off the existing system. But on the Midland side, you have less water production. So I think storing that produced water and being able to use it and reuse it downhole is the next step in the evolution and that should allow that target percentage to come up pretty dramatically over the next couple of years."

There's no doubt that the privates out here in the Permian are really leaning into this higher commodity price.

One is while some privates do have Tier 1 assets, a lot of the privates are more in the Tier 1.5 or Tier 2-ish, and they're not quite as productive. But the reality is, is that the effect on both Permian production and on cost increases is not 0. It's just going to be -- it's a little bit too early to see what the effect is going to be. But I think the more quarters that pass where public companies are exercising the discipline of flat production, I think, is what our industry needs.

And if we're trading below that, even with oil where it is, then the buyback makes sense because that return on a PV basis is a better return to buy in stock market than buy in the ground. So that's kind of the analysis that's going to go into it. Today, it feels like a buyback is the right way to go. But again, it's still August 2 and 3 today, and we have some time to make that decision."

It's part of the calculus, but it's not an either/or, right? The fundamental decision to move into the carbon credits was a recognition that we're doing things operationally in the field that's going to get us to where we want to be over the next couple of years. But this is much more tactical. This is a specific strategy that we're deploying that has meaningful CO2 and flaring reductions associated with it. And that's why we shared the statistics of reducing emissions by 90% on our atmospheric tanks. We think it's really a good way to go. 
And we want to try to be as communicative as we can on this because this isn't a Diamondback secret nor is it something that we're trying to position Diamondback favorably for. This is an industry-wide issue. And I think the solutions need to be industry-wide as well, and we want to be as collaborative as we can be and share these learnings that we have, and this is a very good form to be able to share those techniques. In fact, some of these came probably from ideas that we got from other operators. 
So look, I'm very, very proud of efforts and the results that Diamondback has generated, particularly since we drill line in the same in 2019. And I'm also really proud about what our industry is doing as well. And the narrative has certainly moved away from us or maybe we didn't take advantage of it as an industry to control that narrative, but we've got to do a better job of saying we recognize what it is we're doing has an environmental impact and more importantly, that we are spending dollars and applying that same innovative thought processes that got us horizontal drilling and fracking and the success we've enjoyed by that. So we're really good problem solvers. And we're going to communicate each quarter ways that we're solving this problem on our environmental responsibility objectives."

Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter, extending its track record of operational excellence.

Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter, extending its track record of operational excellence. I am proud of everything our team has been able to accomplish this year by pushing the boundaries of our current thought processes and embracing new technologies and playbooks, many of which have come from the personnel we've added through our acquisitions. Nowhere is that more evident than on the drilling and completion sides of the business where we continue to lower costs and improve cycle times. We've decreased our drill times from spud to total depth by over 30% and are averaging just over 10 days to drill a 2-mile well in the Permian -- in the Midland Basin.  
On the completion side, we're now running 3 simul frac crews, which lower our downtime and improve our pad efficiencies. We are currently completing approximately 2,800 lateral feet per day in the Midland Basin, an improvement of nearly 70% as compared to our early zipper frac designs. All of these operational advances translate to our ability to do more with less. 
While we are seeing some inflation on diesel, steel and other materials, our ability to continually improve operationally and become more efficient has more than offset these cost increases, and our leading-edge DC&E costs continue to be at the low end of our guidance range. As a result, we are decreasing the number of rigs and crews we need to execute this year's capital plan and are reducing our full year capital guidance by $100 million or down 6% from prior expectations. 
On the production side, our wells have outperformed expectations this year. As a result, we are slightly increasing our Permian oil production guidance, which should not be taken as a conscious decision to grow. As we look at supply and demand fundamentals, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, and we continue to believe there's not a call on U.S. shale production growth. We will continue, therefore, to target flat oil production for the foreseeable future and plan to do that by completing less wells than originally planned this year. 
These operational highlights, coupled with a supportive macro backdrop, led to record free cash flow generation for Diamondback. During the second quarter, we generated $578 million in free cash flow or $3.18 per diluted share. To put this into perspective, we entered 2021 anticipating roughly this amount of free cash flow for the full year. We've already put this cash to work by calling and paying down over $600 million of callable debt so far this year with over $600 million more expected later this year when our 2023 notes become callable. In total, this debt reduction will reduce cash interest expense by almost $40 million annually.  
We continue to emphasize that reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns are not mutually exclusive, and we proved this point again by increasing our quarterly dividend by 12.5% from $0.40 a share to $0.45 a share, or $1.80 annualized. This puts our year-to-date dividend growth at 20% above 2020 levels.  
At Diamondback, we prefer to talk about our current performance rather than future promises. However, our performance has allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our base dividend. And we now feel it's appropriate to put up some goalposts as it relates to additional return of capital in 2022, given the current free cash flow outlook and strip pricing.  
Our plan is to distribute 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2022. This form of additional capital return will be decided by the Board at the appropriate time, but we intend to be flexible based on which opportunities we believe present the best return to our stockholders, the owners of our company. Remember, our strategy is unchanged since 2018 when we initiated our base dividend. This additional clarity is simply a evolution of our guidance and also reflective of the maturation of our business. A lot can happen now -- between now and the end of the year, but we feel we are well positioned to take advantage of the current commodity price environment and deliver differential free cash flow in 2022.  
Our capital efficiency improvement allows us to maintain an elevated base level of Permian oil production through 2022 by spending approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion of total capital. The continued improvement in our realized pricing and our low cash cost structure combined to form a best-in-class cash margin, which we plan to protect as we layer on hedges that are focused on protecting extreme downside, allowing our shareholders to participate in commodity price upside.  
Turning to ESG. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. Flaring continues to be one of the biggest drivers of our CO2 emissions. And while we've made significant progress since 2019, we still have work to do. Our target in 2021 is to flare less than 1% of gross gas produced. And in the first half of the year, we were above that number. Now this is primarily due to the integration of the QEP assets, and we expect this metric to improve as we build out additional infrastructure in the Midland Basin and close the Williston divestiture later this quarter.  
We have also begun 2 pilot projects utilizing tankless and limited tank facility designs. While the first tankless facility is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter, we've already had 2 successful limited tank design pilots. On average, this design reduced our CO2 emissions from our storage tanks by more than 90%. Because of this success, we've elected to extend this pilot to another 5 facilities in the back half of this year and expand to an additional 15 facilities in 2022.  
Lastly, we are continuing to build out our electrical substations, which will help minimize emissions from combustion equipment, primarily generators and gas engine-driven compressors. We are working to remove or replace over 200 of these units by 2023. The combination of these efforts position us well to meet our commitment of reducing our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% as compared to 2019 figures by 2024.  
The second quarter exceeded our expectations and exemplified why Diamondback is a leader in the industry. Our people continue to innovate, making us more environmentally responsible and efficient, uniquely positioning us for the future. Our record free cash flow generation allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our dividend, all the while positioning us for robust shareholder returns next year. We are delivering on our exploit and return strategy, continuing to focus on maintaining Permian oil volumes, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders.

We are going to close the Bakken a little bit later than we expected due to external approvals. And so therefore, we kind of raised our full year guide by about 2,500 barrels a day, which is 2 months of the Bakken contribution. But above that, we also raised our overall guide for the year up 2%, and that's really on an apples-to-apples basis versus our Q1 guide. And really, I think the impetus for that is some Permian outperformance early in the year. And therefore, I think we're comfortable raising our Permian guidance on oil to 218 to 222 from 216 to 220. And as Travis said, we're not in growth mode, but the wells this year have outperformed, and we've cut more capital on the CapEx side than we have raised the production side.  
So generally, completing 10 fewer wells this year than originally planned in the Permian, production up a couple of percent, but more importantly, capital down 6% or 7% from where we were before. And that translates to the 2022 plan, which is in dark pencil right now, but flat is kind of the case we're modeling. And I think generally holding that 218,000 to 222,000 barrels a day in the Permian flat with as little capital as possible is how we see it today. This -- the number we posted yesterday kind of bakes in a little bit of service cost inflation as we know our business partners on that side are going to be able to push price a little bit. But generally, really excited about a high Midland Basin percentage of wells completed next year that keeps production flat in a very capital-efficient manner."

And what that number does over time, look, Neil, I couldn't be more excited about the forward outlook of the company.

And we'll make that decision when that cash comes through the doors as to what we're going to do with it.

While that's an increase versus this year, I think what's forgotten is that guide on QEP closed at the end of Q1. So we didn't have a full quarter of their capital contribution. So that's a portion of the 10% to 15% increase, I'd say about half of it. And also the other half is we did have a nice DUC benefit. If you see, we're completing 270 wells and drilling 220 this year. So that's about another $100 million benefit because when we were running as many rigs as we were into the downturn, we decided to not pay early termination fees and instead built a DUC backlog, which was the best use of investor dollars at the time, and we're taking advantage of that a little bit this year. 
So I think generally, from a crew and rig count perspective, we dropped 2 rigs this quarter. We'll probably bring those 2 rigs back, but we'll probably need somewhere around 11 or 12 rigs next year and 3 simul-frac crews and maybe a fourth spot crew to execute on that plan, which is a testament to how efficient the operations team has gotten here."

I think the -- we are above our target so far this year. With the shift to the Midland Basin, we are going to need to build out some permanent infrastructure on the recycling side to be able to not only recycle the water, but also store produced water so that we're not using -- our freshwater intensity will go down on the Midland Basin side. That process is underway. I expect that we have a nice solid connected system across kind of our Sale, Robertson Ranch and Martin County positioned by the middle to the end of next year, and that's going to allow us to up that number significantly. 
So we've used 100% recycled water in the Delaware Basin. Usually, you're just pulling off the existing system. But on the Midland side, you have less water production. So I think storing that produced water and being able to use it and reuse it downhole is the next step in the evolution. And that should allow that target percentage to come up pretty dramatically over the next couple of years."

One is, while some privates do have Tier 1 assets, a lot of the privates are more in the Tier 1.5 or Tier 2-ish, and they're not quite as productive. But the reality is, is that the effect on both Permian production and on cost increases is not 0. 
It's just going to be -- it's a little bit too early to see what the effect is going to be.

I think generally, now with capital being constrained to maintenance, you have a lot of flexibility above that. 
At the end of the day, we fundamentally have to look at what our NAV looks like on a mid-cycle oil price and mid-cycle commodity price environment. And if we're trading below that, even with oil where it is, then the buyback makes sense because that return on a PV basis is a better return to buy in stock market than buy in the ground. So that's kind of the analysis that's going to go into it. Today, it feels like a buyback is the right way to go. But again, it's still August 2 and 3 today, and we have some time to make that decision."

It's part of the calculus, but it's not an either/or, right? The fundamental decision to move into the carbon credits was a recognition that we're doing things operationally in the field that's going to get us to where we want to be over the next couple of years. But this is much more tactical. This is a specific strategy that we're deploying that has meaningful CO2 and flaring reductions associated with it. And that's why we shared the statistics of reducing emissions by 90% on our atmospheric tanks. We think it's really a good way to go. 
And we want to try to be as communicative as we can on this because this isn't a Diamondback secret nor is it something that we're trying to position Diamondback favorably for. This is an industry-wide issue. And I think the solutions need to be industry-wide as well, and we want to be as collaborative as we can be and share these learnings that we have, and this is a very good form to be able to share those techniques. In fact, some of these came probably from ideas that we got from other operators. 
So look, I'm very, very proud of the efforts and the results that Diamondback has generated, particularly since we drew a line in the sand in 2019. And I'm also really proud about what our industry is doing as well. And the narrative has certainly moved away from us or maybe we didn't take advantage of it as an industry to control that narrative, but we've got to do a better job of saying, we recognize what it is we're doing has an environmental impact and more importantly, that we are spending dollars and applying that same innovative thought processes that got us horizontal drilling and fracking and the success we've enjoyed by that. So we're really good problem solvers. And we're going to communicate each quarter ways that we're solving this problem on our environmental responsibility objectives."

The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for Diamondback. We were able to generate a record amount of free cash flow, as we continued to demonstrate why we are an operational leader in the Permian Basin. Although we are seeing pricing pressure in many areas of our business, particularly with consumables and labor, we have been able to offset these inflationary items through efficiency gains, both in design and execution. On the drilling side, we've decreased the number of days it takes to drill from spud to total depth by nearly 30% this year alone. And we're now drilling 2 laterals in roughly 10 days in basin. On the completion side of the business, we've seen a step change in efficiency as we've transitioned the majority of our completion crews to simul-frac operations and are now completing wells in the Midland Basin, nearly 70% faster than when we were utilizing the traditional zipper frac design. These gains drove a significant beat on capital expenditures this quarter and are the primary driver of our second consecutive decrease in CapEx for the year. The efficiencies gained this year will be permanent, and while inflation may impact services prices next year, Diamondback will be more insulated than our peers given our control over the variable costs of well design, days to total depth on the drilling side and lateral feet completed per day on the completion side of the business. 
As a result of these efficiency gains as well as timing associated with some of our ancillary capital spend, we have lowered our 2021 capital guidance for a second time, and now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year, a decrease of 10% when compared to our initial CapEx guidance range we published in April. This includes approximately $435 million to $475 million of estimated capital spend in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to 2022, we are committed to holding our Permian oil production flat next year. We expect to be able to maintain this level of production by spending similar capital on an annualized basis to our fourth quarter guidance. This soft guidance accounts for both the efficiencies we've gained this year as well as the potential for service cost inflation in 2022 should activity levels increase in the Permian Basin and oil prices stay on. The reason we are committed to keeping oil volumes flat in 2022 is that we believe our capital discipline, coupled with our plan to return 50% of anticipated free cash flow to shareholders is the best near-term path to equity value creation. Diamondback is moving from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital, which will benefit long-term return on capital employed and value creation. In order to initiate a moderate growth plan, we would need to see material changes to global oil and gas fundamentals, along with shareholder support for such growth, and we do not see either of those things today. 
Until such time, we will continue to run our business for free cash flow generation, focusing internally and ensuring we maintain our best-in-class cost structure in the face of inflationary pressure. This will position us for success regardless of where we are in the cycle. At current commodity prices, this plan translates to significant free cash flow generation next year. 
In our investor deck, we have a slide that shows illustrative 2022 free cash flow at various commodity prices. At today's strip, 2022 free cash flow is well north of $3 billion. We plan to distribute 50% of this free cash flow using a combination of our sustainable and growing base dividend, share repurchases and variable dividends. We will use repurchases and variable dividends interchangeably depending on which presents the best return to our stockholders at that time. As a reminder, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when we expect the return on that repurchase to be well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices, which was clearly the case in mid-September when our Board approved a $2 billion share repurchase program. After that announcement, we repurchased over 268,000 shares at an average share price of $82 for a total cost of $22 million in the third quarter. If we do not repurchase enough shares in the quarter to equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter,  then we will make our investors whole by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend, but importantly, at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned. We do not set our budget, drill wells or underwrite acquisitions based on a strip oil pricing when current strip pricing is significantly above the last 5-year average. Therefore, we will underwrite repurchasing shares, which we see as an acquisition under the same assumptions. 
Our base dividend continues to be our primary method of returning capital to our shareholders. We have grown our base dividend at a quarterly compounded growth rate of roughly 10% since initiation in 2019. This quarter, we raised our dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share or $2 a share on an annualized basis. Due to our low cost of supply, our dividend is currently protected down to $35 a barrel. As we have said before, increases to our base dividend would occur simultaneously with absolute debt reduction, and this year was a great example of that. Year-to-date, we have used our $1.65 billion of internally generated free cash flow as well as proceeds from divestitures to reduce our gross debt by $1.3 billion and increase our dividend 3x. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, and we expect to end 2021 at just over a turn of leverage. Yesterday, we fully redeemed our $650 million of senior notes due in 2023. As a result, we no longer have any callable debt and our next material maturity is late 2024. 
Because of this, we're now in a position to accelerate our returns program to the fourth quarter of 2021. This is a direct result of the combination of everything I've mentioned today. One, strong operational performance; two, a supportive macro backdrop; and three, increasing financial stream. Yet none of this will be possible without safe and efficient field operations. We continue to build on our safety track record and did not have a recordable employee safety incident this quarter. We've also decreased our flared volumes on our legacy properties and continue to work with third parties to build out additional infrastructure to reduce flared volumes on our recently acquired assets. In addition, we expect to continue to reduce our flared volumes as we move into 2022 in conjunction with the completion of our Bakken divestiture. Yet we're striving to be better, and we recently announced our commitment to and routine flaring by 2025, further reducing our emissions and moving us towards our commitment of reducing Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and and our methane intensity by at least 70% by 2024. 
The third quarter was a record quarter for Diamondback. We are proud to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in the industry and are thankful to operate in a pro-energy environment in the state of Texas. Our products fuel our local communities, our state, our country and the world. We continue to innovate, justifying our environmental license to operate in the communities where we and our families live, work and play. We will continue to operate reliably and safely and are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current macro environment by exercising capital discipline, keeping oil volumes flat and generating significant returns to our shareholders.

It's still going to be 75% or 80% of our wells turned in line in the Midland Basin still at this kind of 65 to 75 wells a quarter run rate. A big difference in '22 versus 2021 is that, remember, we're running a lot of rigs into the downturn in 2020 and decided to keep those rigs running to build DUCs. We drew down about 50 of those DUCs in 2021 and now at a steady-state DUC level. So got a 50 DUC headwind in 2022 versus 2021, and a little more infrastructure and midstream spend on the sale of Robertson Ranches that we acquired from GP and Guidon as we get into full field development there. Cash taxes, if the world stays where it is today, oil price wise, we will have some cash taxes in kind of in the low 9 figures, $100-ish million to $200 million depending where we are, which is a good problem to have. Hopefully, the commodity prices stay where they are."

So I'll start with simul-frac, we picked up our first simul-frac crews in the second half of 2020 and have been running those ever since. They've been extremely efficient, probably saves us about $25 or $30 a foot but more importantly, in areas where you have offset production, you can get in complete those wells and get out and therefore, limit your water out effect in large fields, which has been successful for us. So essentially, probably 90% of our wells next year will be done with the simul-frac crew. We've been running 3 simul-frac crews this year plus a fourth spot crew here and there, and I anticipate that kind of pace to to be similar in 2022. And then on the drilling side, it's been pretty incredible putting the QEP drilling organization together with the Diamondback drilling organization and finding best practices. And this is the first, and we kind of talked about this last quarter and the quarter before that, but now we've fully converted all of our Midland Basin rigs to the clear fluid drilling system that we're utilizing. And you can see an average of 10 days spud to TD has been a pretty large step change. And as Travis said in his comments, we all use the same fixed costs in our wells, but days to TD and amount of lateral feet completed per day are variable costs that we think we certainly differentiate ourselves with. So  that's been the driver of CapEx reductions this year in an inflationary environment which we're seeing, given oil prices and activity levels, that inflation is mitigated by controlling the variable costs, which our operations organization has been able to do."

So you probably see a step change down or step down in GP&T closer to that kind of $1.25 to $1.50 midrange on a go-forward basis.

But if a company comes out and starts growing and gets recognized in the stock market for that growth, then that's going to change the calculus for our board and how we allocate capital towards growth. Again, I think if you look at the macro conditions, post pandemic, we need 100 million barrels a day of demand reestablished, we're probably getting close there. More importantly, we need to see the surplus capacity, whatever that number is in the OPEC+ countries being absorbed in the world's energy equation. And then thirdly, you need to see kind of the 5-year average of global inventories return. And it's unlikely you'll see all 3 of those triangulate precisely, but I think you need to look at the price of oil when those indicators are all pointed at each other. And if the price of oil is $70 or $80 a barrel, then those things are pointed to each other. That probably means we're in good shape in terms of supply and demand. If on the other hand, oil price is significantly higher when those indicators are pointing at each other, then that's probably your first sign that the world is calling for more oil. But even having said that, our Board is dedicated to  making sure we're allocating capital that's going to generate the greatest return to our stockholders. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've rapidly transitioned from a company that that consumes capital for growth to now one that is distributing capital. And we're looking at holding production flat, and we're looking at growing per share measures while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, and we think that's a prudent way to run our business. ."

The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for Diamondback. We were able to generate a record amount of free cash flow as we continued to demonstrate why we are an operational leader in the Permian Basin. Although we are seeing pricing pressure in many areas of our business, particularly with consumables and labor, we have been able to offset these inflationary items through efficiency gains, both in design and execution.
On the drilling side, we've decreased the number of days it takes to drill from spud to total depth by nearly 30% this year alone. And we're now drilling 2-mile laterals in roughly 10 days in the Midland Basin. On the completion side of the business, we've seen a step change in efficiency as we've transitioned the majority of our completion crews to simul-frac operations and are now completing wells in the Midland Basin nearly 70% faster than when we were utilizing the traditional zipper frac design.
These gains drove a significant beat on capital expenditures this quarter and are the primary driver of our second consecutive decrease in CapEx for the year. The efficiencies gained this year will be permanent, and while inflation may impact services prices next year, Diamondback will be more insulated than our peers given our control over the variable costs of well design, days to total depth on the drilling side and lateral feet completed per day on the completion side of the business.
As a result of these efficiency gains as well as timing associated with some of our ancillary capital spend, we have lowered our 2021 capital guidance for a second time and now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year, a decrease of 10% when compared to our initial CapEx guidance range we published in April. This includes approximately $435 million to $475 million of estimated capital spend in the fourth quarter.
Moving to 2022, we are committed to holding our Permian oil production flat next year. We expect to be able to maintain this level of production by spending similar capital on an annualized basis to our fourth quarter guidance. This soft guidance accounts for both the efficiencies we've gained this year as well as the potential for service cost inflation in 2022 should activity levels increase in the Permian Basin and oil prices stay strong.
The reason we are committed to keeping oil volumes flat in 2022 is that we believe our capital discipline, coupled with our plan to return 50% of anticipated free cash flow to shareholders, is the best near-term path to equity value creation. Diamondback is moving from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital, which will benefit long-term return on capital employed and value creation. In order to initiate a moderate growth plan, we would need to see material changes to global oil and gas fundamentals, along with shareholder support for such growth, and we do not see either of those things today.
Until such time, we will continue to run our business for free cash flow generation, focusing internally and ensuring we maintain our best-in-class cost structure in the face of inflationary pressure. This will position us for success regardless of where we are in the cycle.
At current commodity prices, this plan translates to significant free cash flow generation next year. In our investor deck, we have a slide that shows illustrative 2022 free cash flow at various commodity prices. At today's strip, 2022 free cash flow is well north of $3 billion. We plan to distribute 50% of this free cash flow using a combination of our sustainable and growing base dividend, share repurchases and variable dividends. We will use repurchases and variable dividends interchangeably depending on which presents the best return to our stockholders at that time.
As a reminder, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when we expect the return on that repurchase to be well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices, which was clearly the case in mid-September when our Board approved a $2 billion share repurchase program. After that announcement, we repurchased over 268,000 shares at an average share price of $82 for a total cost of $22 million in the third quarter.
If we do not repurchase enough shares in the quarter to equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors whole by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend, but importantly, at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned. We do not set our budget, drill wells or underwrite acquisitions based on a strip oil pricing when current strip pricing is significantly above the last 5-year average. Therefore, we will underwrite repurchasing shares, which we see as an acquisition under the same assumptions.
Our base dividend continues to be our primary method of returning capital to our shareholders. We have grown our base dividend at a quarterly compounded growth rate of roughly 10% since initiation in 2019. This quarter, we raised our dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share or $2 a share on an annualized basis. Due to our low cost of supply, our dividend is currently protected down to $35 a barrel.
As we have said before, increases to our base dividend would occur simultaneously with absolute debt reduction, and this year was a great example of that. Year-to-date, we have used our $1.65 billion of internally generated free cash flow as well as proceeds from divestitures to reduce our gross debt by $1.3 billion and increase our dividend 3x.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, and we expect to end 2021 at just over a turn of leverage. Yesterday, we fully redeemed our $650 million of senior notes due in 2023. As a result, we no longer have any callable debt, and our next material maturity is late 2024. Because of this, we're now in a position to accelerate our returns program to the fourth quarter of 2021. This is a direct result of the combination of everything I've mentioned today: one, strong operational performance; two, a supportive macro backdrop; and three, increasing financial stream.
Yet none of this will be possible without safe and efficient field operations. We continue to build on our safety track record and did not have a recordable employee safety incident this quarter. We've also decreased our flared volumes on our legacy properties and continue to work with third parties to build out additional infrastructure to reduce flared volumes on our recently acquired assets. In addition, we expect to continue our reduced -- continue to reduce our flared volumes as we move into 2022 in conjunction with the completion of our Bakken divestiture. Yet we're striving to be better, and we recently announced our commitment to end routine flaring by 2025, further reducing our emissions and moving us towards our commitment of reducing Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and our methane intensity by at least 70% by 2024.
The third quarter was a record quarter for Diamondback. We are proud to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in the industry and are thankful to operate in a pro-energy environment in the state of Texas. Our products fuel our local communities, our state, our country and the world. We continue to innovate, justifying our environmental license to operate in the communities where we and our families live, work and play.
We will continue to operate reliably and safely and are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current macro environment by exercising capital discipline, keeping oil volumes flat and generating significant returns to our shareholders.

Good questions. From an activity perspective, not a lot is going to change. It's still going to be 75% or 80% of our wells turned in line in the Midland Basin, still at this kind of 65 to 75 wells a quarter run rate. A big difference in '22 versus 2021 is that, remember, we're running a lot of rigs into the downturn in 2020 and decided to keep those rigs running to build DUCs. We drew down about 50 of those DUCs in 2021 and now are at a steady-state DUC level. So got a 50 DUC headwind in 2022 versus 2021 and a little more infrastructure and midstream spend on the sale of Robertson ranches that we acquired from QEP and Guidon as we get into full field development there.
Cash taxes, if the world stays where it is today, oil price-wise, we will have some cash taxes in 2022 kind of in the low 9 figures, $100-ish million to $200 million depending where we are, which is a good problem to have. Hopefully, the commodity prices stay where they are."

They've been extremely efficient, probably saves us about $25 or $30 a foot. But more importantly, in areas where you have offset production, you can get in, complete those wells and get out and therefore, limit your water out effect in large fields, which has been successful for us. So essentially, probably 90% of our wells next year will be done with the simul-frac crew. We've been running 3 simul-frac crews this year plus a fourth spot crew here and there, and I anticipate that kind of pace to be similar in 2022.
And then on the drilling side, it's been pretty incredible putting the QEP drilling organization together with the Diamondback drilling organization and finding best practices. And this is the first -- and we kind of talked about this last quarter and the quarter before that, but now we've fully converted all of our Midland Basin rigs to the clear fluid drilling system that we're utilizing. And you can see an average of 10 days spud to TD has been a pretty large step change. And as Travis said in his comments, we all use the same fixed costs in our wells, but days to TD and amount of lateral feet completed per day are variable costs that we think we certainly differentiate ourselves with.
So that's been the driver of CapEx reductions this year in an inflationary environment, which we're seeing, given oil prices and activity levels. That inflation is mitigated by controlling the variable costs, which our operations organization has been able to do."

In light of this discipline and the recovery in demand, the environment to us continues to look very constructive for the commodity in the sector as valuations certainly remain attractive relative to the market. What are the 1 to 2 potential developments for the sector that give you concern and could change the outlook to a less favorable one?"

But if a company comes out and starts growing and gets recognized in the stock market for that growth, then that's going to change the calculus for our Board and how we allocate capital towards growth.
Again, I think if you look at the macro conditions, post pandemic, we need 100 million barrels a day of demand reestablished. We're probably getting close there. More importantly, we need to see the surplus capacity, whatever that number is in the OPEC+ countries being absorbed in the world's energy equation. And then thirdly, you need to see kind of the 5-year average of global inventories return. And it's unlikely you'll see all 3 of those triangulate precisely, but I think you need to look at the price of oil when those indicators are all pointed at each other. And if the price of oil is $70 or $80 a barrel, then those things are pointed to each other, that probably means we're in good shape in terms of supply and demand. If on the other hand, oil price is significantly higher when those indicators are pointing at each other, then that's probably your first sign that the world is calling for more oil.
But even having said that, our Board is dedicated to making sure we're allocating capital that's going to generate the greatest return to our stockholders. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've rapidly transitioned from a company that consumes capital for growth to now one that is distributing capital. And we're looking at holding production flat, and we're looking at growing per share measures while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, and we think that's a prudent way to run our business."

Diamondback continued to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's stra",1196,"Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. Diamondback continued to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's strategy to move activity to our most productive areas in the second quarter of 2020 is now starting to pay dividends in terms of capital efficiency and early-time well performance. 
Well costs and cash operating costs remain near all-time lows, and our average completed lateral length in the fourth quarter was over 13,000 lateral feet, a company record. These operational achievements will translate directly into increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months. 
We are still operating in a market supported by supply that's being purposefully withheld to allow global inventories to decline as demand recovers from the depths of the global pandemic. Diamondback continues to see no need to grow oil production into this artificially undersupplied market and instead plans to hold fourth quarter 2020 production flat while generating free cash flow used to pay our dividend and pay down debt. 
The Board's decision to increase our dividend by 7% exhibits its confidence in the forward development plan released today, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged: Hold production flat in the most capital-efficient manner, with free cash flow used for our dividend and to pay down debt. Growing our dividend and paying down debt are not mutually exclusive, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used for debt paydown in 2021. 
The fourth quarter of 2020 built on the momentum started in the third quarter, with free cash flow increasing to over $242 million, up 58% from the $153 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter last year. We expect this trend to continue in 2021, where we currently expect to generate nearly $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 oil pro forma for the closing of our acquisition of Guidon this Friday. 
This free cash flow implies a reinvestment ratio below 60% at $50 oil in the midpoint of our $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion capital budget for this year. Note that our CapEx guidance includes the addition of approximately $100 million of capital for the Guidon acquisition, which encompasses one net operated rig added as well as associated infrastructure and environmental spend. 
Our production guidance that ties to this capital budget for 2021 assumes that we hold Diamondback's expected fourth quarter oil production of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day flat, plus 10 months of the 12,000 barrels of oil per day that Guidon was producing at time of acquisition announcement. 
This production guidance also accounts for the estimated impact of the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin last week, which we estimate to have knocked out the equivalent of 100% of our production for 4 to 5 days. Production has nearly returned to pre-storm levels as of today, and we expect to make up a majority of the lost production throughout the year, but will not be able to make it all up in the first quarter. 
The stockholder meeting to vote on our pending merger with QEP Resources is scheduled for March 16. The merger is expected to close shortly thereafter, subject to QEP stockholder approval. Should the deal approve, we will update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable after closing. While this creates a noisy first quarter in terms of production additions, it will also create a clean look at the pro forma business in the second quarter and beyond. 
We have only one material term debt maturity due in the next 4 years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note when it is callable at par later this year. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due 2025 that's currently callable, providing optionality for further gross debt reduction as free cash flow materializes. 
Turning to ESG. Diamondback today announced a major initiative relating to ESG performance and disclosure, including scope 1 and methane emissions intensity reduction targets, as well as a commitment to point forward Scope 1 carbon neutrality or Net Zero Now. We are committing to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024, and we are committing to reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% from 2019 levels, also by 2024. A detailed breakdown of our Scope 1 and methane emissions from 2019 can be seen on Pages 13 and 14 of our latest investor presentation. 
Diamondback expects to continue to reduce flaring, which is now down almost 90% from 2019 levels, directly impacting over 50% of our 2019 Scope 1 emissions. We also expect to spend approximately $15 million a year over the next 4 years to retrofit about 600 of our tank batteries with air-powered pneumatic control systems, replacing methane-emitting, gas-operated pneumatic control systems. These 2 changes will be significant drivers in reducing our carbon footprint, but other initiatives like methane leak detection and full-field electrification will also have a direct impact on our emissions reduction strategy. 
Diamondback today also announced the Net Zero Now initiative, which means as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to be produced with zero net Scope 1 emissions. The GHG and methane intensity reduction targets mentioned earlier are the primary focus as it relates to our environmental responsibility. 
But we recognize we will still have a carbon footprint. Therefore, carbon offset credits will be purchased to offset our remaining emissions. Eventually, we expect Diamondback or one of our subsidiaries to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset our remaining Scope 1 emissions, but the credits are a bridge to that time and place. 
With these major announcements, Diamondback has chosen to adopt a strategy to operate with the highest level of environmental responsibility. Our social and environmental license to operate as a public oil and gas company based in the United States is going to be influenced by our capital providers, and we do not expect our investor pressure for oil and gas companies to improve their environmental performance to subside anytime soon. 
It is incumbent on us to improve our environmental performance and compete for capital in an industry with ever-increasing external pressures. Carbon emissions are a cost, and Diamondback is working to become the low-carbon operator in addition to our leadership position as the operator with the lowest capital and operating cost. 
I'm very excited about Diamondback's current position and the strength of our forward outlook as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase announced yesterday. We are forecasting significant, consistent free cash flow generation translating into returns to shareholders. We look forward to successfully closing and integrating the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, and we'll update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable. 
With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions."

You guys talked about today paying off a little less than $200 million of debt due later this year, plus funding the $375 million of cash from the Guidon acquisition.

But at the Board level, we consistently talk about leaning into the base dividend and continuing to enhance our shareholder -- as a form -- as a way of enhancing our shareholder return program. And it's really, like I said, a problem of blessings to have that kind of free cash flow. 
We want to continue to work the debt quantum down, which we intend to do so. And we'll do like we've always done and be creative in returning that money back to our shareholders. I've been very demonstrative in our stance of not trying to grow production. So any fears that we're going to take money and start drilling more wells with it this year is just off the table.

I wouldn't say it's on the big-ticket items, but you are starting to see some pressure on casing prices and smaller field service items. 
So like we talked about, the midpoint of our guide is 8% to 10% above where well costs are today. I would hope the good guys can keep some of that on our side and outperform as we go through the year. But just being conservative.

Neal, I mean, we had a pretty high flaring number in 2019, and it was pretty frustrating to us that, that number was as high as it was. Unfortunately, it was that high because we had a gas processor who had a percent of proceeds contract that was losing money on that contract, and therefore, it wasn't very fair on how much they sent us to flare versus some of their other contracts. So we took that price risk and decided to restructure that contract into a fixed fee deal. And you can see in the flaring numbers, our numbers have come down dramatically, mostly because of that particular contract moving to fixed fee. 
Now with NGLs and gas rally, that fixed fee stays the same and we get the benefit as the operator. So that's helping a lot. I don't think it had a lot of impact on -- from a storm perspective. I think our field organization during the storm actually stepped up to get power -- or get natural gas flowing back to local power plants in the Permian, which eased the problem and stopped the rolling blackouts in the Permian almost immediately.

For a while, what was it, 6 to 7 rigs and you were talking about completing, I don't know, nearly 200  or up to 200? Could you give us idea of kind of where your optimal efficiencies are?

I mean I think our completion cadence, we're expecting to complete 220 to 225 wells all over 10,000 feet, with 3 simul frac crews and 1 spot crew. 
So really, the efficiency on both sides is pretty dramatic. And you can see that also in the lateral length, right? I mean we completed over 13,000 average lateral feet in Q4, and we're looking for opportunities throughout our entire asset base to push lateral length to that 12,500 or 15,000 foot range."

And then secondarily, when activity really troughed in the second quarter of last year, rather than just sitting on our hands and bemoaning the outlook, our organization really leaned in to try to improve efficiencies. It was a great opportunity with less field activity going on to really examine all of the processes, both on the drilling and completion side and on the production side as well. 
And so we took advantage of that trough in activity. And as the industry picked back up and as our activity picked back up, we were able to kind of make permanent some of those efficiencies that we revealed through the second quarter and early third quarter. So really proud of that, and I think we're going to see the direct benefits of that in 2021, and that's going to translate to more cash flow for our shareholders."

I think the Net Zero Now initiative is a great addition to the story, but it's not the primary focus. And the primary focus happens to be working down all the numbers you see on Slide 13 and 14. And so the big dollars we're going to spend, we're going to spend about $15 million a year converting legacy air -- or legacy gas pneumatic tank batteries to air. And those batteries run off methane essentially, and converting that to air dramatically reduces your methane intensity automatically. 
So I'd expect to see $15 million a year in the budget for that, and we've also built that in on the Guidon and QEP acreage as we get a hold of that and look to convert that. The carbon credits, we've already -- are in process on a contract for some carbon credits. I won't give all the details, but I'll say it's a mid-7-figure number, not an 8-figure number. And the projects that we're investing in are tied directly to carbon capture or carbon sequestration rather than the tree planting side of the business."

We're protecting our dividend and protecting -- paying down some near-term maturities, but also trying not to limit all the upside to our shareholders. 
So I think you'll see us keep building that hedge book with wide collars. I think the percent hedge that we have is inverted just like the forward curve, and I think we're going to be patient adding hedges.

So I believe, and maybe I'm the eternal optimist, but I believe if moving through the depths of a global apocalypse that was created by this pandemic, if oil and gas companies haven't got discipline now, they probably never will. So I'm optimistic that the industry is going to toe the line on capital discipline, irrespective of commodity prices. 
Now there will be, sometime in the future, a signal when supply has worked off and Iranian barrels are absorbed and surplus OPEC capacities has consumed that the world will be signaling for growth. But as we tried to articulate earlier, the days of hyper growth in the shale industry should be part of our history, not part of our future.

It's certainly a chess piece, Charles. I think QEP has 3 notes outstanding, '22s, '23s and '26s. Those notes probably end up getting tendered for and refinanced in some form or fashion, lower interest rate with longer average maturity, but also putting something on the front end of our debt stack to guarantee further debt paydown. 
So it's really dependent upon how many people tender the bonds if and when that begins. I think the FANG 2025 notes is also a chess piece that goes into that. And I think we're pretty close to starting that process with the shareholder vote coming up in March 16. So we wanted to take advantage of these rates with 3 goals: we want to pay down gross debt overall over time at our discretion, we want to lower average interest rate and we want a longer average term to maturity. And I think we're setting ourselves up to accomplish that."

So not to get ahead of ourselves, but we are. Longer term, could this be maybe carved out as a separate business if you develop a portfolio? Because it seems like for a lot of these ESG projects, companies kind of really only get credit or a lot of interest when it turns into like a real business that investors can quantify. And longer term, there's been lots of spin-offs and opportunities for that. So is that something that maybe you would consider?"

This past week, as we're all acutely aware of, the Permian Basin experienced unprecedented weather event. We had over 220 hours of below-freezing weather. And really across the Permian Basin, we had extended periods of no electricity and water supplies frozen and really, against all of that, we had a frozen and a dark oilfield. And our field organization, and in some cases, these individuals working over 20 hours a day, they were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants. They weren't working to get Diamondback's volumes flowing and back online earlier because of our quarterly objectives. They were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants that were -- honestly, that were sitting idle, particularly on the west side of Odessa. And they were sitting idle because they didn't have any fuel. 
And through our efforts and other operators' efforts, gas was delivered and Texas had power. This occurred Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning. And by Thursday, most of Texas, again, had power. And it's -- I just want to -- the efforts that were displayed by many individuals in the Permian Basin transcends normal procedures for returning production. And the Permian Basin is grateful for -- we're really grateful for everything that you guys did. You answered the call and you put forth a heroic effort that will not be forgotten. Just want to tell you publicly, thank you for everything that you guys did. 
So with that, thanks for everyone participating in today's call. And if you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Thanks, Latif."
