And also I want to say just thanks to everyone for joining us on the call here this morning. As you saw from our announcements earlier today, we clearly have a few updates that we want to fill you in on and I'm looking forward to a very productive call this morning. 
Just given the backdrop of COVID, let me just start by saying that I certainly hope that all of you are doing well and staying safe. And continuing to, as much as it's frustrating, I'm sure by now, continuing to social distance and where your masks. I think, at this point, we're all pretty good at it. So let's make sure that we continue to do it. And to all of the ZB team members joining the call this morning and who are listening at a later time, I just want to -- I'm thinking about you as well. I just want to say thanks. Thanks for everything that you do and have done and will do actually to continue to follow our protocols, to keep yourself safe, obviously, but also our teammates safe. And as a result of that, continue to deliver for our customers and our patients and move our mission forward. And I just continue to be very proud of everything this team has accomplished against a significantly challenging backdrop in 2020. So I'm proud of you, I'm glad to see what you've been able to do, and I'm looking forward to what you're going to do in 2021. And here we are, right? We're in 2021. And there's definitely challenges we've seen already early on in 2021, but I'm confident that we're ready to deal with the challenges as we do. And I'm pretty confident that we're going to see some real opportunities for 2021 as well. 
And there's just a lot of updates that I want to share with you today, but I'm going to keep my comments to a minimum, if possible. I really want to make sure that we have time for Suky to get into a little more detail on Q4 and then ultimately say how that's going to translate into 2021. Now we're not going to give too many specifics on 2021, but he'll give you some color, what we're seeing from Q4 and again, the impact we think that's going to have on 2021. And I want to make sure that we leave time for questions as well, okay? 
So for today, I'm just going to kind of keep it to 3 main topics. The first is really how we're continuing to navigate COVID-19 and to continue, inside of that, to ensure that we're executing against our strategy. The second one is really going to talk about the ongoing transformation of the company. We really are making sure that we're moving forward with active portfolio management. And obviously, we're taking the next steps there with the planned spin-off of our Spine and Dental business. So we'll talk a bit about that. And then third, I want to make sure that we, again, touch upon our long-term growth strategy and how it positions us to drive growth, obviously, as a company, but also value for you and value for us. 
And so let's start again, navigating the challenges and executing here in the short term. There's just no doubt that COVID, unfortunately, remains a challenge. Coming out of Q4, we're seeing the pandemic pressure and the surges continue and frankly, worsen across pretty much all of our regions and markets. There's clearly more lockdown measures that we're seeing throughout Europe, Middle East and Africa. To a far lesser extent, but still impacting Asia Pacific as well. And certainly, in the Americas, we're all seeing it in the U.S. May be different by state, but we're clearly seeing increased pressure as a result of surges in the pandemic. So all of that is kind of the backdrop that we saw coming out of Q4. Unfortunately, this pressure in the corresponding decline in elective procedures, grew throughout Q4 and actually was worse at the end of December. And, at this point, we expect that increase in pressure will continue throughout Q1, at least, and will impact all 3 of our regions. As a matter of fact, we're actually seeing this probably increase in pressure coming out of Q4. So we would expect Q1 to be a little more challenging than even what we saw in Q4. 
But even given that backdrop, I'd say that I'm optimistic. Sounds crazy to just say what I said, but say that I'm also optimistic, but the best [indiscernible] approved vaccines. We're currently rolling those out around the world. We do believe the vaccines are going to change the COVID-19 dynamic. And we're going to see positive impact as a result of it. As soon as we start to see the surges stop, we see the impact of COVID. And we're confident that the recovery is going to mean that the normal patient flow is going to start again, and we're going to have the pull-through effect of a sizable patient backlog that's been created over the past number of quarters. We expect that when that recovery occurs, we're going to see a period of what I would define as normal market growth augmented by deferred procedures that will be coming in as well. And we're going to be ready for that. And we're excited about that. So as much as it's going to be at rocky in the short-term and potentially more challenging than what we saw in the fourth quarter, we see a light at the end of the tunnel. And that's a good thing. 
The big question is when? When is that going to happen? We know the vaccine is going to have the impact. The big question is when. And that's certainly going to be the key variable we're going to be looking at as we try to predict where 2021 is going to look like. So while I would just say, against this backdrop of COVID, what is clear to us is we can't control when the vaccines allow the surges to stop, but what we can control inside of that is how we execute our strategy. And I have confidence we're going to continue to move forward. Our core business is strong. Our execution is on point. I would just say momentum around our key commercial launches and programs continues to be strong. And I would say that overall, our commercial confidence is better than it has ever been. 
So let's give a few examples of this. I can say it all day long, but once we talk about it and actually, it reflects in the numbers, who cares. So let's first start with ROSA Knee. Obviously, this is something that everyone's going to be paying attention to. Certainly, I am. And I know we said we're going to hit between 200 to 300 cumulative placements by the end of 2020. Obviously, you know that we are in that range as of Q3. So I'm happy to report that, not only did we achieve that goal, we achieved the high end of that goal. And I would tell you that the momentum is strong coming into 2021. Q4 was actually our strongest quarter as of the date of launch of ROSA Knee. So we had some pretty strong quarters in the past, Q4 was our best, and we were on the high end of the goal that we set for the year. And as I've said before, with some of the new launches that we have coming, specifically associated with the unit, I feel pretty confident that 2021 is going to continue to show that kind of resilience and strength for ROSA Knee. 
On the Persona Revision side, again, this product continues to be very successful for us. We now show that in Q4, we actually had the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen since launch. We did realized our 2020 expectations of $100 million in gross revenue and almost $40 million in net of cannibalization revenue during the year. And I would just tell you that that's just the beginning because Persona Revision serves as a really compelling tip of the spear product for our commercial team. Once we get Persona Revision in, we've got an opportunity to hunt for the typical primary knee as well. So we're very excited about that launch, and it continues to be strong. 
On the hip side, Avenir complete continues to be a strong one for us. Even in the pandemic, it continues to beat our expectations. And if I just look at Q4 specifically, we grew about 30% over Q3, again, even with the increased pressures of the pandemic in Q4. So very excited with what we're able to do with Avenir Complete, and we expect big things to continue with this product throughout 2021. And as you obviously know, we also expect at the end of 2021 to launch the ROSA Hip which, again, gives us a lot of confidence in the hip category for our business. 
And then finally, for Signature One planner, we demonstrated, again, strong sequential growth with registrations up nearly 25% in Q4 over Q3, and we expect utilization to continue to expand significantly in 2021 with really a goal of having more than 50% of our shoulder procedures using pre surgical planning. And that's important for a lot of reasons. Remember, the presurgical planning create stickiness with the customer. But it also enhances our ability to get more guides and to augment using the procedure, which can really take up the ASP for that procedure. So again, exciting stuff with signature One planner as well. 
And so all in, we continue to execute. We continue to execute the team. The way we're showing up every day, the way we're showing up in the market, frankly, versus our peers, gives me confidence in our business as does our continued innovation and our product launches. But we're going to see more this year, some pretty pivotal innovation that we're going to see this year. As I mentioned before, we're going to see what ROSA Partial Knee, we're going to see ROSA Hip. And we're also going to see the first smart implant, Persona IQ, launched this year. So definitely exciting for us from an innovation standpoint in 2021. 
And yes, that leads me to really my second topic this morning. We continue the transformation of ZB. That's been the goal since I got here. You've heard me talk about our 3 phases of transformation. First was the hearts and minds and the execution challenges that we had in the very beginning. That's what we talked about a lot in the beginning. The second phase of this was really doing a more robust, longer-term strategy, making sure that we brought innovation to the market and getting our execution straight. We're clearly well into that base. And third is our portfolio transformation. And that's the goal of active portfolio management, to change the complexion of the organization so that we can have better goal of sustaining the mid single-digit growth. 
And I'm proud to say that we're squarely positioned in Phase III now as well. And as you've seen by our recent announcement, we're going to continue to move this forward. We have the portfolio management strategy and the process in place and to build a pretty strong capability to move us forward in this area. Late last year, we executed a number of smaller but still important, M&A deals to fill portfolio gaps and to better position us in higher growth areas that we do believe we have a right to win in. And just this morning, we announced our intent to spin-off our Spine and Dental businesses. Ultimately creating, we believe, 2 independent, publicly traded companies, both Zimmer Biomet and the new company called NewCo that are going to be better positioned, separate. I truly believe, by separating out these businesses, we're going to create 2 stronger companies. 2 companies that are going to be better positioned to meet customer needs and improve patient lives and ultimately, and very importantly, deliver greater value to you, our shareholders. 
And let me give you a bit more detail on why we believe this is an opportunity for value creation and really why we think it delivers value for both the ZB and NewCo. First of all, the transaction increases our management focus and resource prioritization. We truly do believe for both companies. We think about NewCo, and we think it's going to thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategies and growth opportunities and internal investments inside of Spine and Dental that has not been a focus for ZB. It will absolutely be a focus for NewCo. 
And for Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important next step in our transition into a more streamlined company with sharper focus in greater and more optimized resource allocation towards innovation in those core businesses that we are committed to that are profitable for us, where we see attractive markets with a right to win in those markets and be market leaders. 
And really, the second thing is it's going to drive increased growth and efficiency for both companies. We really do believe that. Simply put it, we expect that these 2 companies, with their simplified operating models and just reduced complexity and increased focus, we'll be able to grow revenue, margin and earnings per share faster than they would if we remain combined as one company. And Suky is going to talk more about the specific financial impact that we expect in just a few minutes, but just note, it's positive for both organizations, financially speaking, as we separate the organizations. 
And third, it's going to enhance value creation for our patients, our providers and all of our key stakeholders, including our own team members. This is the next step in ZB's transformation, and it underscores our commitment to ensuring long-term priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest. It's going drive the business forward to meet customer needs and advance our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life of people around the world. We think we can do it better as 2 separate organizations. 
Okay. So that's the backdrop of the spin. And today, obviously, it's just day 1 in terms of announcements around this process. You can absolutely expect that we're going to continue to provide updates as we move forward, as NewCo take shape and as we move towards the transaction close, which we're currently expecting to be around mid-2022. 
Okay. So we're confident in the steps we're taking in our ability to keep executing and in our overall ZB strategy. And that brings me really to the third and really the final topic that I have for these remarks, and it's our plan to drive long-term growth. And ultimately, as a result of that, deliver increased value for you. And to do that, we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. In fact, the spin-off transaction that we're going to do over the next year serves to de risk, if not accelerate, our path to that 4% to 5% growth rate we've talked about and our 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And to get there, to be able to deliver on both of those, we're going to have to be committed to our priority growth areas, and we've talked about these in the past, but I'm going to remind you of them again. The key area of concentration for us would be knees, hips and set. 
If we think about knees, first and foremost, we need to be able to grow above market rates here. And we're going to continue to focus on the fastest growth submarkets of knees. For us, that's going to be robotics, data and informatics, cementless revision. We feel we have plenty of innovation and momentum here to continue to grow sustainably above market rates in knee. 
From a hip perspective, it's a little less ambitious in the beginning. We just said that we need to grow at market in the short term, with the idea that over the long term, particularly after ROSA Hip is launched, that we would grow above market in hip as well. And I can tell you based on our performance so far, the ROSA Hip application being launched later in 2021 and the Avenir Complete momentum that we have, we feel confident we're going to be able to do that as well. And as far as that goes, we just want to grow at market, if not the higher end of market. And to do that, we're going to focus on the most attractive sub-element to set for us and that's, for us, again, going to be sports medicine and extremities. Those are key areas of concentration for us that we're going to invest internally. We're going to look for external ways to build scale, and we're going to build commercial infrastructure as well, right? 
It's only closed by saying that I continue to be more confident about ZB's future than ever. I know I say that a lot recently, but I really do feel the momentum right now. I truly believe that we are well positioned for success and that our strategy is absolutely working. And our transformation is well underway. And our proven ability to rise to challenges and face adversity, I think has prepared us well for navigating the current environment. And really, for that matter, any environment in front of us. And I just want to, again, say thanks to the entire ZB team in your focus on our mission, our strategy and how we show up and execute every day is unmatched. It's what makes ZB and what makes me confident that we're going to continue to deliver. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for more financial details of the quarter and also looking forward. Okay. Suky?"
264048,700595764,2194231,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the details, I'd like to summarize the quarter as one where we made significant progress across a number of strategic and operational fronts, all in the backdrop of heightened market pressure. While",1778,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the details, I'd like to summarize the quarter as one where we made significant progress across a number of strategic and operational fronts, all in the backdrop of heightened market pressure. While revenue and profitability were challenged due to the pandemic, we executed extremely well against the things we can control, positioning ourselves to win through eventual market recovery and beyond. 
Now for this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 2 topics. First, our Q4 results, including commentary on the COVID impact and what we're seeing so far in Q1; and second, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth specifically, how we believe the spinoff transaction we announced this morning is expected to impact us post execution. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. 
Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.085 billion, a reported decrease of 1.9% and a constant currency decrease of 3.7% versus 2019. But we did not experience any material day rate differences in our year-over-year comparisons. Our consolidated regional results were in line with expectations despite deepening pandemic pressure on global elective procedures as we exited the year. While the market softened through the quarter, execution remained strong across all regions. 
Beginning with Asia Pacific. The region grew 2% versus Q4 2019 with growth across all 3 of our largest markets of Japan, China and Australia, New Zealand. While COVID pressure on elective procedures increased towards the end of the quarter, the impact is less pronounced than what we are seeing in EMEA and the Americas. We are excited about the uptake we're seeing in ROSA in the region and with the solid performance across our knee and hip businesses. 
As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 17.5% versus 2019, with all subregions in decline. Surges in the virus leading to policy actions and government lockdowns negatively impacted elective procedures across the region. 
Lastly, the Americas region was about flat, decreasing 0.3% compared to 2019, driven by continued COVID headwinds in Latin America, in tandem with a softening U.S. market. The U.S. was flat despite increased pressure on elective procedures. Performance was buoyed by continued strong demand for recent innovative product introductions, strong execution by our commercial organization and some favorable impact related to the order timing and year-end purchases, as some accounts increased their buying patterns to utilize remaining 2020 budgets. 
Turning to our business performance for Q4. The global knee business declined 4.8%, negatively impacted by the ongoing pressures in EMEA. However, the us knee business continued to grow, increasing 1.8%, and Asia Pacific knee business returned to growth increasing 2.9%. Overall, execution was strong with continued momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. 
Our global hip business decreased 3.4%, again, driven by declines in EMEA. Both U.S. hips and APAC hips continued their growth trends, increasing 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. 
Sports extremity and trauma sales declined 3.3%. [indiscernible] spine and CMFT continued to deliver better execution, increasing 0.8%. And finally, our other category was down 9.3%. 
Moving to the P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11. Additional details on our GAAP results can be viewed in our press release issued this morning. On an adjusted basis, with revenue down 3.7%, EPS was down about 10%, driven by a lower operating margin and a higher share count, which more than offset the favorable tax rate in the quarter. Lower adjusted operating margin was driven by lower revenue and an expected year-over-year decline in gross margins. Adjusted gross margin was 71.3%, sequentially better than Q3 but lower than Q4 2019. Versus the prior year, favorable geographic mix was more than offset by lower volumes, ongoing pricing pressure and the impact from prior period deferred costs. 
OpEx was down versus the prior year as we implemented several cost containment initiatives as part of our response to the pandemic, in addition to the realization of our transformation programs that were ultimately reinvested back into R&D and commercial infrastructure to help drive consistent above-market growth in priority areas. Based on our performance versus market over the recent quarters, our reinvestment of efficiency savings is translating into strong returns. 
The Q4 adjusted tax rate of 15% was better than the previous year due to geographic mix of income and certain discrete benefits in the quarter related to recent audit settlements. 
Turning to cash and liquidity in the quarter. Free cash flow totaled $329 million, higher than the same period in 2019, driven by better working capital and lower capital expenditures. And we utilized better-than-expected cash flow to pay down $250 million of debt ahead of schedule, ending the year with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $800 million. 
Now moving to 2021. Due to the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on elective procedures, we will not be providing full year financial guidance at this time. We recognize that this is challenging for you as you build your '21 models. However, we will reserve financial guidance until we have more certainty around the outlook of elective procedures relative to COVID surges, and related vaccine adoption. 
We strive to be credible and transparent. And to that end, I will provide additional quarterly details and broader full year shaping as an interim measure. So far through January, we've seen COVID pressure continuing to intensify from the end of December. Based on what we've seen so far in the quarter and in tandem with our latest estimates for procedure cadence, we project that Q1 revenue will be down in the low single-digit to mid single-digit percentage range versus Q1 2020. 
Now we have optimism and confidence that we'll see a positive vaccine impact on elective procedures this year. And once we do, we expect elective procedure volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels and the sizable patient backlog to serve as a tailwind to underlying market growth. 
As we turn to the P&L, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on sales volume will put pressure on adjusted operating margins and earnings leverage until we return to consistent pre-COVID revenue levels and growth rates, as I just discussed. Despite this near-term pressure, our confidence in the market recovery and the longer-term financial profile of the company is driving continued investment into priority areas of the business. We expect that adjusted gross margin will stabilize in 2021, with quarterly margin levels broadly in line with what we saw in the back half of 2020. We could see some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on a number of variables, including volumes, price, foreign currency, mix and other drivers that can change results over time. 
Regarding operating expenses. Sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect noncommission spending in Q1 to be modestly lower with increases in future quarters' OpEx investments as the impact of the pandemic abates. We expect interest expense to increase in the mid-single-digit versus 2020, as the benefit from lower debt balances was more than offset by the renewal of net investment hedge positions. Our tax rate is expected to be modestly higher than the full year 2020 rate and could fluctuate over the year as a result of variability in geographic mix of income due to the pandemic. Also, we are not projecting any material U.S. corporate tax reform to be implemented in 2021. We project that the full year share count in 2021 will continue to increase modestly versus Q4 2020, and we are not planning for any share buybacks in the year. And in terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and are planning to pay down an additional $500 million of debt in 2021. 
Now let's turn to today's announcement related to our intent to spin the Spine and Dental businesses into an independent publicly traded company. The transaction will be structures of tax redistribution of newly issued NewCo shares to ZB shareholders. As Bryan mentioned, we believe that this tax-efficient transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2022, subject to certain conditions, will drive greater focus for each company with an enhanced prioritization of capital allocation, while accelerating growth and providing the platform for greater shareholder value. 
In terms of the NewCo financial profile, 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenues totaled approximately $1.022 billion and $897 million, respectively, and is supported by a diversified geographic base with real opportunities for enhanced growth and margin expansion. We expect NewCo to have a financial profile generally in line with its peer group and a capital structure supportive of innovation and investment over time. Importantly, the transaction will empower NewCo to pursue a more focused investment and execution strategy. 
ZB delivered 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenue of $6.96 billion and $6.128 billion, respectively. For post-spin ZB, the transaction is expected to deliver an improved growth profile with accretion to our revenue growth of approximately 50 basis points over the course of our 5-year strategic planning period. We also expect that it will expand our adjusted EBITDA and operating margins on a pro forma basis by approximately 125 basis points. With that, you should have even greater confidence in our operating margin expansion goals. We remain committed to at least 30% adjusted operating margins by the end of 2023. And with this transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate the timing of that goal. However, we will continue to balance margin acceleration against investment opportunities to accelerate durable top line growth. Ultimately, this transaction provides greater optionality to invest more in the business, while delivering a leading margin profile, and that's an incredibly powerful lever. 
And in terms of capital structure, post spin, we will prioritize proceeds towards debt pay down to maintain our investment-grade rating. 
We're truly excited about this transformational opportunity to increase value for our investors, and we'll continue to provide more details as execution of the spin progresses. 
To summarize, while the pandemic continued to pressure our growth and earnings profile in the quarter, we made substantial progress on many fronts, including very strong performance versus the market; progress on our efficiency programs that enabled increased investment for growth; free cash flow generation that was ahead of revenue growth; strengthening of our balance sheet through early pay down of debt; integrating our strategic and accretive tuck-in M&A deals; and positioning ourselves to execute the spin-off of our Spine and Dental business as a platform for greater value. I'm truly proud of what the ZB team accomplished in the quarter and throughout 2020. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri."

But yes, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We do want to look at tuck-in acquisitions that we think would have low dis-synergy risk and know we have a right to win in the space. And that's what we're going to continue to do. This does not change that. 
And Suky, you want to give maybe a little more color just overall on the overall capital allocation strategy?"

And as cash flows improve as the virus abate throughout 2021, that will increase and expand our opportunity in firepower opportunity for continued tuck-in M&A. So again, consistent with how we talked about previously. First priority is to maintain investment grade, pay down debt, delever. And our second priority from a capital allocation standpoint is to continue to grow that top line and bottom line through accretive strategic tuck-in M&A.

But what we should look at here is that you should have greater confidence, obviously, in our ability to do that and potentially be on the higher end of that range. And so that is a key focus for us. And really the significant value for us is that ability to focus. Remember, we talked before about giving you 4% to 5%. We had a number of variables associated with it. One of those variables, even though we didn't have the same level of investment in these businesses, was that they had to grow at least at the lower end of the market. And over time, if you're not investing appropriately in businesses, there's risk in that. So we've eliminated that risk as we spin these out, and we've gone unlocked value for SpinCo because ultimately -- or NewCo because ultimately, they're going to invest more intently in those businesses. So it provides value in both ways.

On your first question relative to the year-end and the U.S. number, it's not uncommon at the end of any quarter, especially at the end of the year-end, to see higher sales and some potential timing favorability or headwinds for that matter. In this quarter, we actually saw some incremental uptake in our U.S. business. Again, probably not different than what many others saw across our sector as many accounts were utilizing their year-end budgets to bring in some product. 
For us, we look at it, it was a modest benefit on the total company. It was in the low single digits. But again, it was something that was above our normal trend, so we wanted to make sure we called it out. And we get any impact that, that might have into 2021 is reflected in those Q1 estimates that I've already provided. So overall, still a very, very strong quarter for the company versus market, both in knee and hip. 
Your second question relative to ROSA. We did see a shift in the fourth quarter, especially with those expanded hospital budgets or remaining buckets, I should say, more dollar sales on installments than we've previously seen in Q2 and Q3. But year-over-year, Q4 last year to this year, it was not a major material headwind or tailwind on our overall growth numbers."

And we've looked at multiple ways to drive value with these businesses. Just know that this isn't the only option that we've looked at.

And I got to say, there's a lot of excitement around that in our organization, a lot of excitement from our customer base as well. And the competency that we've built over the last few years in this area is, in my opinion, second to none. And where we don't have the competency, we've been working with external partners that have pretty significant name's like Apple, and you're going to hear more about those coming up as well. So we feel really good about where we are today. And we feel, in my opinion, anyway, that these ecosystems to be able to capture data before, during and after procedure are going to be a significant benefit for patient outcomes. And ultimately, at some point, when we pick up enough data and have the data like available to us, be able to have predictive analytics to be able to make better pure decisions before the surgery occurs.

So the first thing I would say is we provide some color on the pro forma accretion impact on our RemainCo EBITDA on operating margins, which should give you a good initial view as to what the NewCo margins could look like. 
Just stepping back, overall, both those businesses are, Spine, Dental is and our bone healing business, have a gross margin profile that's a little bit below the overall company average. I would say bone healing is actually a little bit above the company average. But really, it comes down to the cost to serve where the spending levels in both those businesses are much higher than the company average, which overall drives the operating margin for both Spine and Dental lower than where ZB HoldCo is from a stand-alone basis. 
So as we think about margin opportunity going forward in both this business, we do think that there's opportunity to enhance margins. One will come through, we believe, a real opportunity to accelerate top line growth, which will bring some operating leverage to the business. But there's also opportunity for mix shift and potential efficiency within the existing cost structure.

So first, on revenue, why we're not providing guidance is because there are a number of variables that are just really difficult to predict at this time with any level of credibility or confidence. The first being where is the trough in this most recent surge that we're seeing. January, February, where does it land in Q1? What does that uptake look like post adoption of vaccine. And then when do you ultimately return to normalized market growth and potential tailwind from the deferred procedures. So we're running a number of scenarios. There are some scenarios where absolutely we could see a path to growth versus 2019. But again, those variables are, at this point, just too uncertain.
But clearly, I think just stepping back, once we do have adoption -- wide adoption of that vaccine, which we believe will have at some point in 2021, we think that there's a real opportunity for some strong growth, again, once we return to normalized market and are augmented by that tailwind. But it's just too difficult to say what our cadence looks like at this time. 
Regarding margins, you're absolutely right. As the margins or revenue continues to improve throughout the year, which we believe it will, once we have good uptake with the vaccine, the margins should follow. There may be a slight lag, consistent with how we've talked about things before as we catch up on certain investments. But make no mistake, they will expand, and we do see the opportunity for significant margin expansion over time as we normalize our revenue uptake."

Knees is a little better than hips, but we're seeing outperformance in both. Knees probably more 600 to 700 and hips, more like 500 to 600 basis points better. So that's what I look at.

So it was important for us in a normal quarter given this quarter differential between competitors, not as material. And I would be surprised, quite frankly, if others didn't see the same thing. But either way, that's -- we just want to make sure we call it out as being transparent as we possibly can. And that was the order of magnitude that we saw in the quarter. 
As far as the spin and having both Dental and Spine together, if you're going to spin a business, you want to make sure that it has a reasonable amount of scale, obviously, for it to be a viable publicly traded company. We feel that $1 billion-plus is kind of that number. Although there's not obvious reasons that you would look at from a strategic standpoint that those businesses would be together from a commercial perspective, there is a lot of capability and know-how and materials that are used for implants across dental as well as spine that there is some value in. And so it was really more around the idea of scale and the importance of that scale and utilizing those competencies, if you will, on the raw materials that go across those 2 businesses. And that was the reason why we spun both together."

Don't get me wrong for this thing to occur and to occur as effectively as we wanted to. But it's not going to be disruptive to the 2 organizations because they're pretty again separated today. But yes, we're actually increasing, not a significant amount, but increasing spend in these businesses to get them a good tailwind coming into the spin itself. And if there was small opportunities for us to spend capital over the next 12 months, that would make sense to again, to bolster that portfolio, we would certainly consider it in the same way that we would have beforehand. But we want to make sure that we're setting up NewCo to the first success. And we're very close on a CEO to bring in, and that person will bring leadership right out of the gate. And so that's really the way we're looking at it. If we can give them a little more money to spend to get things going, that's what we're going to do here in 2021. And if, again, very small deals, but if there were things that we could do to, again, bolster their portfolio, we'd do that as well."

If you think about it, we're trying to attack is the fact that 20% of patients in the knee right now are still not satisfied with the outcome that they have. That's a pretty significant number. And we truly do believe that the ecosystem is going to be able to help resolve that disappointment in the procedure. And that's good for everybody, by the way. As we move down this path, we make those outcomes at better as a result of capturing the data and then making different decisions as a result of the data, that's going to allow us to get better outcomes. And when that occurs, you're going to have more patients get bold enough to move into the funnel because it's underserved today. There are patients that need a knee procedure that are afraid of the outcome, are not competent as a result of it, and they're not entering the funnel. So as we can change that outcome, and we believe we can, then we're going to have more people into the funnel, and let's get to the entire market. That's the way we're thinking about data and informatics and driving better outcomes over time. 
As far as ROSA goes, I'll tell you, I'm excited. We've got one application in our robotic system. I think that's what people remind people of just one application, there's 2 more coming this year, but there's one right now. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we were at the higher end of our placement goal in 2020. But what I would tell you is that in reality, we were above that number. When I say higher end, I actually meant above 300. And the quarter was significant. And I think this is really important. We placed over 115 units in the fourth quarter, which was just an outstanding performance by the team. And what I love about that is that happened in concert with one of our other players in the marketplace, one of our competitors also having a record quarter in the fourth quarter. And that's good news because that tells you that orthopedics is open for robotics -- wide open for robotics. And that tells you that you've got an opportunity for all [ boats to rise ] as a result. So we truly do believe that the market is accepting of robotics, it's moving quickly, it's hitting the pivot point, and it's going to be very accepting, we believe, as well of the data and informatics that can come with it."

So we had a really strong quarter, no doubt in the U.S. We'll continue to see momentum for all the products that Bryan mentioned earlier. And that just actually accelerated in the fourth quarter. And now we've shown it consistently for a few quarters.

There are certain categories that we've talked about in the past where we believe we have a right to win, that we have a brand recognition that gives us that right to win, and there's a path for leadership as a result of that. And they're profitable. And those are really the main things we're focused on. How do we enter into spaces, build scale in faster growth markets, where we have a right to win, and we have a path to leadership and the profitable businesses. And that wasn't the case for us for Spine. But it doesn't mean that Spine can't be a very attractive business. It's just not one that we would invest in to become a leader because there's other opportunities for us to spend in sports or extremities or thoracic that are just more attractive markets and more profitable. So we would look at these as being better as a result of that as separate businesses versus a part of our portfolio. 
And I don't believe, and we certainly haven't seen that there's a real benefit in having even a fulsome spine business in concert with large joints or set. We just don't see a lot of contracting -- large contracts that pull-through either one of those businesses."

As you saw from our announcements earlier today, we clearly have a few updates that we want to fill you in on, and I'm looking forward to a very productive call this morning.  
Just given the backdrop of COVID, let me just start by saying that I certainly hope that all of you are doing well and staying safe. And continuing to, as much as it's frustrating, I'm sure by now, continuing to social distance and wear your masks. So I think, at this point, we're all pretty good at it. So let's make sure that we continue to do it. And to all of the ZB team members joining the call this morning and who are listening at a later time, I just want to let you know I'm thinking about you as well. I just want to say thanks. Thanks for everything that you do and have done and will do actually to continue to follow our protocols, to keep yourself safe, obviously, but also your teammates safe. And as a result of that, continue to deliver for our customers and our patients and move our mission forward. 
I just continue to be very proud of everything this team has accomplished against a significantly challenging backdrop in 2020. So I'm proud of you, I'm glad to see what you've been able to do, and I'm looking forward to what you're going to do in 2021. And here we are, right? We're in 2021. And there's going to be challenges. We've seen already early on in 2021, but I'm confident that we're ready to deal with the challenges as we do. And I'm pretty confident that we're going to see some real opportunities for 2021 as well.  
And there's just a lot of updates that I want to share with you today, but I'm going to keep my comments to a minimum, if possible. I really want to make sure that we have time for Suky to get into a little more detail on Q4, and then ultimately say how that's going to translate into 2021. Now we're not going to give too many specifics on 2021, but he'll give you some color, what we're seeing from Q4 and again, the impact we think that's going to have on 2021. And I want to make sure that we leave time for questions as well.
Okay. So for today, I'm just going to kind of keep it to 3 main topics. The first is really how we're continuing to navigate COVID-19 and to continue, inside of that, to ensure that we're executing against our strategy. The second one is really going to talk about the ongoing transformation of the company. We really are making sure that we're moving forward with active portfolio management. And obviously, we're taking the next steps there with the planned spinoff of our Spine and Dental business, so we'll talk a bit about that. And then third, I want to make sure that we, again, touch upon our long-term growth strategy and how it positions us to drive growth, obviously, as a company, but also value for you and value for us.  
And so let's start again navigating the challenges and executing here in the short term. There's just no doubt that COVID, unfortunately, remains a challenge. Coming out of Q4, we're seeing the pandemic pressure and the surges continue and frankly, worsen across pretty much all of our regions and markets. There's clearly more lockdown measures that we're seeing throughout Europe, Middle East and Africa, to a far lesser extent, but still impacting Asia Pacific as well. And certainly, in the Americas, we're all seeing it in the U.S. May be different by state, but we're clearly seeing increased pressure as a result of surges in the pandemic. So all of that is kind of the backdrop that we saw coming out of Q4. 
Unfortunately, this pressure in the corresponding decline in elective procedures, grew throughout Q4 and actually was worse at the end of December. And at this point, we expect that increase in pressure will continue throughout Q1, at least, and will impact all 3 of our regions. As a matter of fact, we're actually seeing this probably increase in pressure coming out of Q4. So we would expect Q1 to be a little more challenging than even what we saw in Q4.  
But even given that backdrop, I'd say that I'm optimistic. Sounds crazy to just say what I said, but say that I'm also optimistic, but that's thanks to the approved vaccines. We're currently rolling those out around the world. We do believe the vaccines are going to change the COVID-19 dynamic, and we're going to see positive impact as a result of it. As soon as we start to see the surges stop, we see the impact of COVID end. And we're confident that the recovery is going to mean that the normal patient flow is going to start again, and we're going to have the pull-through effect of a sizable patient backlog that's been created over the past number of quarters. 
We expect that when that recovery occurs, we're going to see a period of what I would define as normal market growth augmented by deferred procedures that will be coming in as well. We're going to be ready for that, and we're excited about that. So as much as it's going to be a little rocky in the short term and potentially more challenging than what we saw in the fourth quarter, we see a light at the end of the tunnel, and that's a good thing.  
The big question is when? When is that going to happen? We know the vaccine is going to have the impact, the big question is when. And that's certainly going to be the key variable we're going to be looking at as we try to predict where 2021 is going to look like. So well, I would just say, against this backdrop of COVID, what is clear to us is we can't control when the vaccines allow the surges to stop. But what we can control inside of that is how we execute, how we execute our strategy. And I have confidence we're going to continue to move forward. Our core business is strong. Our execution is on point. I would just say momentum around our key commercial launches and programs continues to be strong. And I would say that overall, our commercial confidence is better than it has ever been.  
So let's give a few examples of this. I can say it all day long, but once we talk about it and actually, it reflects in the numbers, who cares? So let's first start with ROSA Knee. Obviously, this is something that everyone's going to be paying attention to. Certainly, I am. And I know we said we're going to hit between 200 to 300 cumulative placements by the end of 2020. Obviously, you know that we are in that range as of Q3. So I'm happy to report that, not only did we achieve that goal, we achieved the high end of that goal. And I would tell you that the momentum is strong coming into 2021. 
Q4 was actually our strongest quarter as of the date of launch of ROSA Knee. So we had some pretty strong quarters in the past, Q4 was our best and we were on the high end of the goal that we set for the year. And as I've said before, with some of the new launches that we have coming, specifically associated with the uni, I feel pretty confident that 2021 is going to continue to show that kind of resilience and strength for ROSA Knee.  
On the Persona Revision side, again, this product continues to be very successful for us. We now show that in Q4, we actually had the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen since launch. We did realize our 2020 expectations of $100 million in gross revenue and almost $40 million in net of cannibalization revenue during the year. And I would just tell you that, that's just the beginning because Persona Revision serves as a really compelling tip of the spear product for our commercial team. Once we get Persona Revision in, we've got an opportunity to hunt for the typical primary knee as well. So we're very excited about that launch, and it continues to be strong.  
On the hip side, Avenir Complete continues to be a strong one for us. Even in the pandemic, it continues to beat our expectations. And if I just look at Q4 specifically, we grew about 30% over Q3, again, even with the increased pressures of the pandemic in Q4. So very excited with what we're able to do with Avenir Complete, and we expect big things to continue with this product throughout 2021. And as you obviously know, we also expect at the end of 2021 to launch the ROSA Hip, which again gives us a lot of confidence in the hip category for our business.  
And then finally, for Signature ONE Planner, we demonstrated just again strong sequential growth, with registrations up nearly 25% in Q4 over Q3, and we expect utilization to continue to expand significantly in 2021 with really a goal of having more than 50% of our shoulder procedures using presurgical planning. And that's important for a lot of reasons. Remember, the presurgical planning create stickiness with the customer, but it also enhances our ability to get more guides and to augment using the procedure, which can really take up the ASP for that procedure. So again, exciting stuff with Signature ONE Planner as well.  
And so all in, we continue to execute. We continue to execute the team. The way we're showing up every day, the way we're showing up in the market frankly versus our peers gives me confidence in our business as does our continued innovation and our product launches. But we're going to see more this year, some pretty pivotal innovation that we're going to see this year. As I mentioned before, we're going to see ROSA Partial Knee, we're going to see ROSA Hip and we're also going to see the first smart implant, Persona iQ, launched this year. So definitely exciting for us from an innovation standpoint in 2021.  
And yes, that leads me to really my second topic this morning. We continue the transformation of ZB. That's been the goal since I got here. You've heard me talk about our 3 phases of transformation. First was the hearts and minds and the execution challenges that we had in the very beginning. That's what we talked about a lot in the beginning. The second phase of this was really doing a more robust, longer-term strategy, making sure that we brought innovation to the market and getting our execution straight. We're clearly well into that base. And third is our portfolio transformation. And that's the goal of active portfolio management, to change the complexion of the organization so that we can have better goal of sustaining the mid single-digit growth.  
And I'm proud to say that we're squarely positioned in Phase III now as well. And as you've seen by our recent announcement, we're going to continue to move this forward. We have the portfolio management strategy and the process in place and to build a pretty strong capability to move us forward in this area. Late last year, we executed a number of smaller, but still important M&A deals to fill portfolio gaps and to better position us in higher-growth areas that we do believe we have a right to win in. 
And just this morning, we announced our intent to spinoff our Spine and Dental businesses, ultimately creating, we believe, 2 independent, publicly traded companies, both Zimmer Biomet and the new company called NewCo that are going to be better positioned separate. I truly believe, by separating out these businesses, we're going to create 2 stronger companies, 2 companies that are going to be better positioned to meet customer needs and improve patient lives and ultimately and very importantly, deliver greater value to you, our shareholders.  
And let me give you a bit more detail on why we believe this is an opportunity for value creation and really why we think it delivers value for both ZB and NewCo. First of all, the transaction increases our management focus and resource prioritization, we truly do believe for both companies. We think about NewCo, and we think it's going to thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategies and growth opportunities and internal investments inside of Spine and Dental that has not been a focus for ZB. It will absolutely be a focus for NewCo.  
And for Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important next step in our transition into a more streamlined company, with sharper focus in greater and more optimized resource allocation towards innovation in those core businesses that we are committed to, that are profitable for us, where we see attractive markets with a right to win in those markets and be market leaders.  
And really, the second thing is it's going to drive increased growth and efficiency for both companies. We really do believe that. Simply put, we expect that these 2 companies, with their simplified operating models and just reduced complexity and increased focus, we'll be able to grow revenue, margin and earnings per share faster than they would if we remain combined as one company. And Suky is going to talk more about the specific financial impact that we expect in just a few minutes. But just note, it's positive for both organizations, financially speaking, as we separate the organizations.  
And third, it's going to enhance value creation for our patients, our providers and all of our key stakeholders, including our own team members. This is the next step in ZB's transformation, and it underscores our commitment to ensuring long-term priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest. It's going drive the business forward to meet customer needs and advance our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life of people around the world. We think we can do it better as 2 separate organizations.  
Okay. So that's the backdrop of the spin. And today, obviously, it's just day 1 in terms of announcements around this process. You can absolutely expect that we're going to continue to provide updates as we move forward, as NewCo take shape and as we move towards the transaction close, which we're currently expecting to be around mid-2022.  
Okay. So we're confident in the steps we're taking and our ability to keep executing and in our overall ZB strategy. And that brings me really to the third and really the final topic that I have for these remarks, and it's our plan to drive long-term growth. And ultimately, as a result of that, deliver increased value for you. And to do that, we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. In fact, the spinoff transaction that we're going to do over the next year serves to derisk, if not accelerate, our path to that 4% to 5% growth rate we've talked about and our 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And to get there, to be able to deliver on both of those, we're going to have to be committed to our priority growth areas. And we've talked about these in the past, but I'm going to remind you of them again. The key area of concentration for us would be knees, hips and S.E.T.  
If we think about knees, first and foremost, we need to be able to grow above-market rates here. And we're going to continue to focus on the fastest growth submarkets of knees. For us, that's going to be robotics, data and informatics, cementless and Revision. We feel we have plenty of innovation and momentum here to continue to grow sustainably above-market rates in knee.  
From a hip perspective, it's a little less ambitious in the beginning. We just said that we need to grow at market in the short term, with the idea that over the long term, particularly after ROSA Hip is launched, that we would grow above market in hip as well. And I can tell you based on our performance so far, the ROSA Hip application being launched later in 2021 and the Avenir Complete momentum that we have, we feel confident we're going to be able to do that as well. 
And as far as that goes, we just want to grow at market, if not the higher end of market. And to do that, we're going to focus on the most attractive sub-element of S.E.T for us, and that's for us, again, going to be sports medicine and extremities. Those are key areas of concentration for us that we're going to invest internally. We're going to look for external ways to build scale, and we're going to build commercial infrastructure as well, right?  
And so let me close by saying that I continue to be more confident about ZB's future than ever. I know I say that a lot recently, but I really do feel the momentum right now. I truly believe that we are well positioned for success and that our strategy is absolutely working and our transformation is well underway. And our proven ability to rise to challenges and face adversity, I think, has prepared us well for navigating the current environment and really, for that matter, any environment in front of us. And I just want to, again, say thanks to the entire ZB team, that your focus on our mission, our strategy and how we show up and execute every day is unmatched. It's what makes ZB and what makes me confident that we're going to continue to deliver.  
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for more financial details of the quarter and also looking forward, okay? Suky?"
264048,700595764,2194416,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the details, I'd like to summarize the quarter as one where we made significant progress across a number of strategic and operational fronts, all in the backdrop of heightened market pressure. While",1776,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the details, I'd like to summarize the quarter as one where we made significant progress across a number of strategic and operational fronts, all in the backdrop of heightened market pressure. While revenue and profitability were challenged due to the pandemic, we executed extremely well against the things we can control, positioning ourselves to win through eventual market recovery and beyond.  
Now for this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 2 topics. First, our Q4 results, including commentary on the COVID impact and what we're seeing so far in Q1; and second, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth, specifically, how we believe the spinoff transaction we announced this morning is expected to impact us post execution. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis.  
Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.085 billion, a reported decrease of 1.9% and a constant currency decrease of 3.7% versus 2019. But we did not experience any material day rate differences in our year-over-year comparisons. Our consolidated regional results were in line with expectations despite deepening pandemic pressure on global elective procedures as we exited the year. While the market softened through the quarter, execution remained strong across all regions.  
Beginning with Asia Pacific. The region grew 2% versus Q4 2019 with growth across all 3 of our largest markets of Japan, China and Australia, New Zealand. While COVID pressure on elective procedures increased towards the end of the quarter, the impact is less pronounced than what we are seeing in EMEA and the Americas. We are excited about the uptake we're seeing in ROSA in the region and with the solid performance across our knee and hip businesses.  
As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 17.5% versus 2019, with all subregions in decline. Surges in the virus leading to policy actions and government lockdowns negatively impacted elective procedures across the region.  
Lastly, the Americas region was about flat, decreasing 0.3% compared to 2019, driven by continued COVID headwinds in Latin America, in tandem with a softening U.S. market. The U.S. was flat despite increased pressure on elective procedures. Performance was buoyed by continued strong demand for recent innovative product introductions, strong execution by our commercial organization and some favorable impact related to the order timing and year-end purchases, as some accounts increased their buying patterns to utilize remaining 2020 budgets.  
Turning to our business performance for Q4. The global knee business declined 4.8%, negatively impacted by the ongoing pressures in EMEA. However, the U.S. knee business continue to grow, increasing 1.8%, and Asia Pacific knee business returned to growth, increasing 2.9%. Overall, execution was strong with continued momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee.  
Our global hip business decreased 3.4%, again, driven by declines in EMEA. Both U.S. hips and APAC hips continued their growth trends, increasing 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively.  
Sports extremity and trauma sales declined 3.3%. Dental, Spine and CMFT continued to deliver better execution, increasing 0.8%.  And finally, our Other category was down 9.3%.  
Moving to the P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11. Additional details on our GAAP results can be viewed in our press release issued this morning. On an adjusted basis, with revenue down 3.7%, EPS was down about 10%, driven by a lower operating margin and a higher share count, which more than offset the favorable tax rate in the quarter. Lower adjusted operating margin was driven by lower revenue and an expected year-over-year decline in gross margins. Adjusted gross margin was 71.3%, sequentially better than Q3 but lower than Q4 2019. Versus the prior year, favorable geographic mix was more than offset by lower volumes, ongoing pricing pressure and the impact from prior period deferred costs.  
OpEx was down versus the prior year as we implemented several cost containment initiatives as part of our response to the pandemic, in addition to the realization of our transformation programs that were ultimately reinvested back into R&D and commercial infrastructure to help drive consistent above-market growth in priority areas. Based on our performance versus market over the recent quarters, our reinvestment of efficiency savings is translating into strong returns.  The Q4 adjusted tax rate of 15% was better than the previous year due to geographic mix of income and certain discrete benefits in the quarter related to recent audit settlements.  
Turning to cash and liquidity in the quarter. Free cash flow totaled $329 million, higher than the same period in 2019, driven by better working capital and lower capital expenditures. And we utilized better-than-expected cash flow to pay down $250 million of debt ahead of schedule, ending the year with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $800 million.  
Now moving to 2021. Due to the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on elective procedures, we will not be providing full year financial guidance at this time. We recognize that this is challenging for you as you build your '21 models. However, we will reserve financial guidance until we have more certainty around the outlook of elective procedures relative to COVID surges and related vaccine adoption.  
We strive to be credible and transparent. And to that end, I will provide additional quarterly details and broader full year shaping as an interim measure. So far through January, we've seen COVID pressure continuing to intensify from the end of December. Based on what we've seen so far in the quarter, and in tandem with our latest estimates for procedure cadence, we project that Q1 revenue will be down in the low single-digit to mid single-digit percentage range versus Q1 2020.  
Now we have optimism and confidence that we'll see a positive vaccine impact on elective procedures this year. And once we do, we expect elective procedure volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels and the sizable patient backlog to serve as a tailwind to underlying market growth.  
As we turn to the P&L, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on sales volume will put pressure on adjusted operating margins and earnings leverage until we return to consistent pre-COVID revenue levels and growth rates, as I just discussed. Despite this near-term pressure, our confidence in the market recovery and the longer-term financial profile of the company is driving continued investment into priority areas of the business. We expect that adjusted gross margin will stabilize in 2021, with quarterly margin levels broadly in line with what we saw in the back half of 2020. We could see some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on a number of variables, including volumes, price, foreign currency, mix and other drivers that can change results over time.  
Regarding operating expenses. Sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect noncommission spending in Q1 to be modestly lower, with increases in future quarters' OpEx investments as the impact of the pandemic abates. We expect interest expense to increase in the mid-single-digit versus 2020, as the benefit from lower debt balances was more than offset by the renewal of net investment hedge positions. 
Our tax rate is expected to be modestly higher than the full year 2020 rate and could fluctuate over the year as a result of variability  and geographic mix of income due to the pandemic. Also, we are not projecting any material U.S. corporate tax reform to be implemented in 2021. We project that the full year share count in 2021 will continue to increase modestly versus Q4 2020, and we are not planning for any share buybacks in the year. And in terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and are planning to pay down an additional $500 million of debt in 2021.  
Now let's turn to today's announcement related to our intent to spin the Spine and Dental businesses into an independent publicly traded company. The transaction will be structures of tax redistribution of newly issued NewCo shares to ZB shareholders. As Bryan mentioned, we believe that this tax-efficient transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2022 subject to certain conditions, will drive greater focus for each company with an enhanced prioritization of capital allocation, while accelerating growth and providing the platform for greater shareholder value.  
In terms of the NewCo financial profile, 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenues totaled approximately $1.022 billion and $897 million, respectively, and is supported by a diversified geographic base with real opportunities for enhanced growth and margin expansion. We expect NewCo to have a financial profile generally in line with its peer group and a capital structure supportive of innovation and investment over time. Importantly, the transaction will empower NewCo to pursue a more focused investment and execution strategy.  
ZB delivered 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenue of $6.96 billion and $6.128 billion, respectively. For post-spin ZB, the transaction is expected to deliver an improved growth profile with accretion to our revenue growth of approximately 50 basis points over the course of our 5-year strategic planning period. We also expect that it will expand our adjusted EBITDA and operating margins on a pro forma basis by approximately 125 basis points. With that, you should have even greater confidence in our operating margin expansion goals. 
We remain committed to at least 30% adjusted operating margins by the end of 2023. And with this transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate the timing of that goal. However, we will continue to balance margin acceleration against investment opportunities to accelerate durable top line growth. Ultimately, this transaction provides greater optionality to invest more in the business while delivering a leading margin profile, and that's an incredibly powerful lever.  
And in terms of capital structure, post spin, we will prioritize proceeds towards debt paydown to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're truly excited about this transformational opportunity to increase value for our investors, and we'll continue to provide more details as execution of the spin progresses.  
To summarize, while the pandemic continued to pressure our growth and earnings profile in the quarter, we made substantial progress on many fronts, including very strong performance versus the market; progress on our efficiency programs that enabled increased investment for growth; free cash flow generation that was ahead of revenue growth; strengthening of our balance sheet through early paydown of debt; integrating our strategic and accretive tuck-in M&A deals; and positioning ourselves to execute the spinoff of our Spine and Dental business as a platform for greater value. I'm truly proud of what the ZB team accomplished in the quarter and throughout 2020.  
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri."

And really, the significant value for us is that ability to focus. Remember, we talked before about getting to 4% to 5%. We had a number of variables associated with it. One of those variables, even though we didn't have the same level of investment in these businesses, was that they had to grow at least at the lower end of the market. And over time, if you're not investing appropriately in businesses, there's risk in that. So we've eliminated that risk as we spin these out, and we've unlocked value for SpinCo because ultimately -- or NewCo because ultimately, they're going to invest more intently in those businesses. So it provides value in both ways. 
But go ahead on your second question there."

Again, probably not different than what many others saw across our sector as many accounts were utilizing their year-end budgets to bring in some product. 
For us, we look at it, it was a modest benefit on the total company. It was in the low single digits. But again, it was something that was above our normal trend, so we wanted to make sure we called it out. And again, any impact that, that might have into 2021 is reflected in those Q1 estimates that I've already provided. So overall, still a very, very strong quarter for the company versus market, both in knee and hip. 
Your second question relative to ROSA. We did see a shift in the fourth quarter, especially with those expanded hospital budgets or remaining budgets, I should say, more dollar sales on installments than we've previously seen in Q2 and Q3. But year-over-year, Q4 last year to this year, it was not a major material headwind or tailwind on our overall growth numbers."

So the timing of it is it fits right into the phases of where we look at transforming the business. For us, it was sequential. We wanted to make sure that Phase I in our transformation was in great shape, and it is. Phase II would need to be well underway before we want to take something like this on. And I think based on our performance over the last few quarters versus our competitors, it's pretty clear that Phase II is working quite well. And now it's time. It's time for active portfolio management. 
And in a time when we don't have as much capital to work with, this is clearly one of the most significant ways that we can impact and influence the portfolio in a positive way for both companies, sorry, should you do believe that. So that's the why now. And we're excited about it. We truly are. We're excited about it for our organization, our NewCo, and we're excited about it for NewCo. And we'll be in it together for the next year, 1.5 years and even post that. So that's the margin -- the why now. 
And we've looked at multiple ways to drive value with these businesses. Just know that this isn't the only option that we've looked at. And just given the number of options on the table, we felt that this was the most significant way we could drive value for our shareholders and our businesses and our team members. So that's the reason for the spin."

We've had a significant shift in our research and development dollars towards robotic storage, data informatics to build that ecosystem that's going to be meaningful for patients and for our customers alike. 
And I got to say, there's a lot of excitement around that in our organization, a lot of excitement from our customer base as well. And the competency that we've built over the last few years in this area is, in my opinion, second to none. And where we don't have the competency, we've been working with external partners that have pretty significant names like Apple, and you're going to hear more about those coming up as well. So we feel really good about where we are today. And we feel, in my opinion, anyway, that these ecosystems to be able to capture data before, during and after procedure are going to be a significant benefit for patient outcomes. And ultimately, at some point, when we pick up enough data and have the data like available to us, be able to have predictive analytics to be able to make better care decisions before the surgery occurs. And that's really the intent. So we're very excited about it. We've shifted dramatically research and development in this area, and we feel we're ahead right now versus our competitors."

So the first thing I would say is we provide some color on the pro forma accretion impact on our RemainCo EBITDA and operating margins, which should give you a good initial view as to what the NewCo margins could look like. 
Just stepping back, overall, both those businesses are, Spine, Dental and our bone healing business, have a gross margin profile that's a little bit below the overall company average. I would say bone healing is actually a little bit above the company average. But really, it comes down to the cost to serve where the spending levels in both those businesses are much higher than the company average, which overall drives the operating margin for both Spine and Dental lower than where ZB HoldCo is from a stand-alone basis. 
So as we think about margin opportunity going forward in both those business, we do think that there's opportunity to enhance margins. One will come through, we believe, a real opportunity to accelerate top line growth, which will bring some operating leverage to the business. But there's also opportunity for mix shift and potential efficiency within the existing cost structure. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on how to think about margins in those businesses going forward."

So first, on revenue, why we're not providing guidance is because there are a number of variables that are just really difficult to predict at this time with any level of credibility or confidence. The first being where is the trough in this most recent surge that we're seeing. January, February, where does it land in Q1? What does that uptake look like post adoption of vaccine? And then when do you ultimately return to normalized market growth and potential tailwind from the deferred procedures? 
So we're running a number of scenarios. There are some scenarios where absolutely we could see a path to growth versus 2019. But again, those variables are, at this point, just too uncertain. But clearly, I think just stepping back, once we do have adoption -- wide adoption of that vaccine, which we believe will have at some point in 2021, we think that there's a real opportunity for some strong growth, again, once we return to normalized market and are augmented by that tailwind. But it's just too difficult to say what our cadence looks like at this time. 
Regarding margins, you're absolutely right. As the margins or revenue continues to improve throughout the year, which we believe it will, once we have good uptake with the vaccine, the margins should follow. There may be a slight lag, consistent with how we've talked about things before as we catch up on certain investments. But make no mistake, they will expand, and we do see the opportunity for significant margin expansion over time as we normalize our revenue uptake."

And if I think about U.S., which is probably the cleanest way to look at this because there's a lot of noise in the mix and everything else that people may have outside of the U.S., but we just look at U.S. and we're somewhere in the neighborhood, you just think about large joints, 500 to 600 basis points over the last 3 quarters above market, above our key competitors. Knees is a little better than hips, but we're seeing outperformance in both. Knees probably more 600 to 700 and hips, more like 500 to 600 basis points better. So that's what I look at. Not a single quarter, but a combination of quarters and where we're seeing that trend. 
And by the way, I fully expect us to continue that trend. And I talked about the innovation that is going to be pretty pivotal this year in both hips and knees.

And again, the reason I asked is that your hip and knee growth in the U.S. is so materially above what we're seeing from peers. The gap was just very, very wide this quarter. So any sense as to the quantification on U.S. hips and knees on those bulk orders would be great?
And then on the second question, which is on the spin announcement, Bryan. I mean I don't think it's unfair to say that Spine and Dental are 2 relatively subscale businesses with not a lot of synergies between them.

If I was going to try to put a number to it, I'd say maybe in the 200 to 300 basis points of benefit that we saw, if you're thinking about large joints. So it was important for us in a normal quarter given this quarter differential between us and competitors not as material. And I would be surprised, quite frankly, if others didn't see the same thing. But either way, that's -- we just want to make sure we call it out as being transparent as we possibly can. And that was the order of magnitude that we saw in the quarter. 
As far as the spin and having both Dental and Spine together, if you're going to spin a business, you want to make sure that it has a reasonable amount of scale, obviously, for it to be a viable publicly traded company. We feel that $1 billion-plus is kind of that number. Although there's not obvious reasons that you would look at from a strategic standpoint that those businesses would be together from a commercial perspective, there is a lot of capability and know-how and materials that are used for implants across Dental as well as Spine that there is some value in. And so it was really more around the idea of scale and the importance of that scale and utilizing those competencies, if you will, on those raw materials that go across those 2 businesses.

It's not as fulsome yet is -- hip or knee, but it's getting there pretty quick.

If you think about it, we're trying to attack is the fact that 20% of patients in the knee right now are still not satisfied with the outcome that they have. That's a pretty significant number. And we truly do believe that the ecosystem is going to be able to help resolve that disappointment in any procedure. And that's good for everybody, by the way. As we move down this path, we make those outcomes look better as a result of capturing the data and then making different decisions as a result of the data, that's going to allow us to get better outcomes. And when that occurs, you're going to have more patients get bold enough to move into the funnel because it's underserved today. There are patients that need a knee procedure that are afraid of the outcome, are not competent as a result of it, and they're not entering the funnel. So as we can change that outcome, and we believe we can, then we're going to have more people into the funnel, and that's good for the entire market. That's the way we're thinking about data informatics and driving better outcomes over time. 
As far as ROSA goes, I'll tell you, I'm excited. We've got one application in our robotics system. I think that's what people remind people of just one application, there's 2 more coming this year, but there's one right now. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we were at the higher end of our placement goal in 2020. But what I would tell you is that in reality, we were above that number. When I say higher end, I actually meant above 300. And the quarter was significant. And I think this is really important. We placed over 115 units in the fourth quarter, which was just an outstanding performance by the team. And what I love about that is that happened in concert with one of our other players in the marketplace, one of our competitors also having a record quarter in the fourth quarter. And that's good news because that tells you that orthopedics is open for robotics -- wide open for robotics. And that tells you that you've got an opportunity for all boats to rise as a result. So we truly do believe that the market is accepting of robotics, it's moving quickly, it's hitting the pivot point and it's going to be very accepting, we believe, as well of the data informatics that can come with it."

So we had a really strong quarter, no doubt, in the U.S. We'll continue to see momentum for all the products that Bryan mentioned earlier. And that just actually accelerated in the fourth quarter.

So our strategy around M&A and how we would spend capital dollars to augment the portfolio is unchanged. There are certain categories that we've talked about in the past where we believe we have a right to win, that we have a brand recognition that gives us that right to win, and there's a path for leadership as a result of that. And they're profitable. And those are really the main things we're focused on. How do we enter into spaces, build scale in faster-growth markets, where we have a right to win, and we have a path to leadership and the profitable businesses. And that wasn't the case for us, for Spine. But it doesn't mean that Spine can't be a very attractive business. It's just not one that we would invest in to become a leader because there's other opportunities for us to spend in sports or extremities or thoracic that are just more attractive markets and more profitable. So we would look at these as being better as a result of that as separate businesses versus a part of our portfolio. 
And I don't believe, and we certainly haven't seen, that there's a real benefit in having even a fulsome Spine business in concert with large joints or S.E.T. We just don't see a lot of contracting -- large contracts that pull-through either one of those businesses."

As Brian mentioned, our underlying fundamentals remain strong as does our confidence in our outlook. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics. First, our Q1 results, including commentary on the impact of",1377,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, our underlying fundamentals remain strong as does our confidence in our outlook. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics. First, our Q1 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID; second, how that translates into our full year 2021 financial guidance that we provided this morning. And third, how Zb is positioned for long-term growth in 2022 and beyond. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q1 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020 and and my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Net sales in the first quarter were $1.847 billion, a reported increase of 3.6% and a constant currency increase of 80 basis points versus the same period in 2020. 
It's important to note that we had one fewer selling day, resulting in approximately 150 basis point headwind to consolidated revenue growth. Overall, consolidated and regional results were better than our initial expectations, as vaccine adoption continued to ramp up and pandemic pressure eased across most markets in March versus January and February. First, the Americas increased 1%. We continue to see variability by country, and while the region was in decline for most of the quarter, a sharp increase in U.S. procedures in March drove regional growth. As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 10.3% with all submarkets in decline. While we did see some recovery or decrease in COVID pressure as we move through the quarter, some markets continue to operate under recently enacted restrictions and actions that are limiting the near-term recovery of elective procedures. So we are continuing to monitor uptake very closely and expect that recovery in EMEA will lag other regions by 1 to 2 quarters. 
Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 15.5% with solid year-over-year growth across our 3 largest markets. Overall, we've seen a stabilization around COVID cases and surges in the region, but we continue to see some significant delays in recovery across India and other smaller markets. Turning to our business performance in Q1. Before jumping in, let me call out that we've updated our product category reporting to provide visibility into Newco and to align products to categories based on how we internally evaluate performance of those businesses. 
Also, we have adjusted our historic reporting of revenue for these changes to assist in year-over-year comparisons. First, our ROSA robotics capital revenue has been moved from the knee category to the other category. And our disposable revenue associated with robotic knee procedures have been moved from the other category into the knee category. This will allow us to more clearly indicate to investors the growth of our base knee business and sets us up for reporting once we launch ROSA hip, which is currently expected in the second half of 2021. We've also broken out our global spine and dental revenues this quarter in conjunction with Newco reporting. And as a result, CMFT is now included within set. The global knee business declined 5.2% versus Q1 2020, negatively impacted by ongoing pressure from COVID. Inside of that, we continue to see strong momentum from Persona and from ROSA mine. Our global hip business increased 0.3%. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific continued their growth trends, increasing 0.9% and 11.2%, respectively. We continue to see strong demand and favorable feedback on the Avenir complete hip with adoption from both gold and platinum accounts. 
Sports extremity and trauma increased 7.2%, driven by solid growth in upper extremities, trauma and CMFT. In SEP, we continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the signature 1 surgical planning system for soldier procedures. Our Dental and spine segment grew 9.6%, fueled by outpaced recovery, especially in Dental. New products and better commercial execution also drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business and from OBC and tether within Spine. 
Finally, our other category was down 2.5%. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, our other category includes the contribution of ROSA knee capital sales. Moving on to the P&L. In the first quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.71. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $2.46 last year. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue in the current period in tandem with prior year goodwill and product liability related charges. On an adjusted basis, EPS was up about 60 basis points driven by higher revenues, with operating margins down slightly compared to 2020 and a higher share count. The adjusted tax rate of 16% in the quarter was better-than-expected, driven by the realization of excess stock compensation benefit and other smaller discrete items. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. Overall, operating cash flows were $247 million and free cash flow totaled $137 million for the first quarter. We paid down an additional $200 million of debt and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $724 million. We continue to make good progress with another quarter of delevering the balance sheet. 
Moving to our full year outlook and financial guidance. While we continue to see pressure due to the global pandemic, vaccine rollout and adoption is approaching meaningful levels. Translating into a reduction of infection surges and hospitalizations in most markets. This increased stability gives us greater confidence that we'll return to normalized market growth in our key markets within the year and also begin to see deferred patients reenter as an added tailwind. As a result, today, we provided financial guidance based on our latest expectations, and that is underpinned by 2 key assumptions: First, current vaccine adoption trends continue to strengthen, driving a decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases through 2021; and second, hospitals increase capacity to work through some portion of patient backlog this year. 
Against that backdrop, our current expectations for full year 2021 financial results are reported revenue growth of 14% to 17% versus 2020 with an expected foreign currency exchange tailwind of approximately 150 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margins of 26.5% to 27.5%, an adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.50 to $8 and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Inside of that guidance, we expect to see seasonality in revenues in '21 that begins to resemble pre-COVID cadence. 
Additionally, our investments in R&D and key commercial initiatives will increase throughout the year. However, we do expect operating margins to improve as we exit 2021 as a result of higher revenues. Net interest expense is expected to step up about 5% versus 2020, and we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 211 million shares for the full year. Of course, we will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the year. 
Let me now turn to our long-term growth profile. We continue to expect our structural organic revenue growth rate to accelerate to the mid single-digit range, with adjusted operating margins of at least 30% as we exit 2023. We're confident in our expectations as a result of the following proof points. First, we have been delivering consistent strong performance versus the market. Second, we have the best new product pipeline in the company's history that will complement an already robust portfolio. And third, our global team members continue to ramp up execution across our strategic priorities. In addition, our previously announced transformation initiatives are progressing well, and the addition of a Chief Transformation Officer has the potential to drive even greater investment opportunity for growth while maintaining a leading margin profile. 
To summarize, we are pleased with our better-than-expected revenue performance in Q1. While we anticipate or prepared for ongoing short-term market uncertainty due to COVID and remain sensitive to ongoing challenges in a number of markets. From a financial standpoint, we believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us and look forward to improving results as we execute on our strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerry."

So I would say, it's not as simple math, is that, but it's pretty close, right? I mean, because you've got to remember, certain portions of our business would not have patients that would have a disease state that continues to -- that they have to deal with. And so not all of our revenue then is linked to procedures that have been deferred. But if I take those that are, and we also have kind of a percentage that we would assume will drop out of the funnel. We still have a very sizable backlog, hundreds of millions of dollars. So maybe not quite the number you're referencing, but the math logic makes sense when you peel out some of those other pieces. Now relative to the cadence or state at which we're going to digest those patients. It's difficult to predict. I mean we've never experienced anything of this size and magnitude and global impact. And so I don't know that I have a perfect proxy to determine how quickly we can actually work through that backlog of patients. 
But my general feeling is easy to look at just historical views of this, although much smaller and different, it's usually 12 to 18 months. You typically work through a backlog funnel. My guess is it will take at least that long, given the size and the magnitude of the backlog that we're talking about here. And it's going to be different. It's going to be different depending on where you are in the world. Certain places in the world will move that backlog through much faster in other places that will go a lot slower because the incentives are not there just to be able to digest again that patient flow as quickly. So again, I guess the takeaway is it should be a very large backlog of patients that will be pretty substantial dollars for us to be able to take advantage of as a tailwind, but the timing of that, the speed at which we work through is we're just not sure yet."

Versus 2020, we we were up -- sorry, just under 100 basis points versus the prior year, better than our commentary earlier in the quarter, where we expect to be down low to mid-single digits, and that was really because of the sharp uptake, as I talked about in March, primarily in the U.S., and we saw greater stabilization faster stabilization in Asia Pacific than we expected. That more than offset a lingering headwind or below expectation for EMEA. Versus 2020, things get a little bit choppy because of the comparisons to prior year in COVID. But if you look at Q1 versus 2019, we were down, that implies about 8%. And as we exited March, we were also down versus 2019. 
Now our guidance moving forward when compared to 2019 assumes sequential improvement in growth rate in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So far, as we've entered into Q2, we've got confidence in that shaping for Q2. We expect to exit the second quarter at about 2019 levels, not for the full quarter, but as we exit and inside of that, we expect Asia Pacific to be above Q2 of 2019. The Americas about flat to slightly up and EMEA continuing to lag. And again, the early start that we've seen so far in the second quarter gives us positive proof points and confidence that we'll see that sequential step-up in the second quarter."

But at the end of the day, you can't do anything until you get the FDA approval. 
So that's what we're waiting on and when we get that, we'll be moving forward. My guess is we'll be able to launch this over the next handful of months. But what I would just size this right, this is a unique launch for us. It's first of its kind. We're going to take our time. We're going to do a limited launch this year. I would expect material revenue in 2021. The full launch would really come towards the end of 2021 or 2022. But we really want to make sure that we're concentrating on a few customers. Going deep with those customers, really understanding the data capturing the value that it brings. So then from there going in a more widespread way. Now if we pick up information quickly, and our confidence level grows more quickly than we're expecting, then you could see a difference this year than what I'm predicting right now. But I would think about it as launch this year, obviously, more limited in the way we would do that launch and then a more aggressive launch, more full launch as we come into 2022."

I is part of that spend that I talked about for the ZB ecosystem, right? And we think about ZB edge, it is a very unique part of it, too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're an implant company. This is where our rand butter is for sure. But what we want to do is we want to elevate beyond that and make sure that we've got an ecosystem around it. In IQ, although extremely important in that is a variable in the overall equation. You still got my mobility that we connect with IQ, which would connect with ROSA and Ortho Wintel is kind of a backdrop to that and would allow us to be able to collect data on a patient before surgery, interoperatively, post surgery and then be able to use those data ultimately to change the way of care for the patient. And that's what's so exciting about it. And so I think you can't really compare this to a typical knee implant or another implant and the timeline it might take up to drive real traction or materiality in the market because it's that unique. It is -- it really is a connection point to this broader capability that just does not exist today. So it will be interesting to see. 
We've got a pretty ambitious plan that we have in front of us. And the feedback so far from our evaluating surgeons has been very strong. And just generally in the marketplace, this desire to have data and be able to use the data to have better insights to be able to provide every care, better care is real. And ultimately, what we're so excited about is as we collect data right out of the gate, we're first to market, obviously, with a smart implant. But as we collect data, we'll stay out ahead of folks because that data is really where the magic is. The implant is interesting. You can listen to it right away. But as you collect a certain amount of data over a period of time, that is actually what provides the insights that are going to matter in the future. And so that gives us an opportunity to stay ahead. So we're very excited about it. It is part of that R&D spend, and we believe that it has the opportunity to have a better ramping curve than a typical implant just because it's so unique."

Our guidance assumes sort of normalized growth rates to historic levels or '19 levels. Inside of that, we would expect, if you look at sort of the midpoint of our guidance range, that, first of all, we expect COVID to continue to lever in many markets within the second half of the year. But broadly, offsetting that will be some additional capacity that comes through hospital systems in other markets to basically net that out. And that's not uncommon. We saw that in the third quarter of last year when you look at our results as COVID will stabilize and you saw hospitals actually increase their capacity to start to bring that backlog through. So again, at the midpoint of our range, we kind of assumed that lingering COVID is out there in certain markets, but that's offset by additional capacity in other markets. 
So net net, you're effectively keeping your backlog steady. Towards the bottom end of our range, we assume that COVID has a bigger impact on that backlog pull-through. And at the upper end of our range, we assume that backlog capacity more than exceeds the COVID pressure that we expect to see lingering through the second half of the year. So that's kind of how we see it. Again, we did see those proof points in the third quarter of last year. And as we expect to see pull-through through this year. On the backlog, we expect it to resemble very much what we saw in the third quarter of last year."

And as you can tell, we're not seeing disruption, if anything, we're actually seeing momentum, which is great. 
But I would say on the cervical disk side, I kind of like the idea of others entering the market because, ultimately, I truly do believe the cervical disc is a better way to go to fusion. And so if we have more people entering the space, talking about it. I think we've got an opportunity to convert more of the business that's out there today in fusion. That's really the target. If we can increase the size of the cervical market, that's a good thing for everybody. A good thing for patients, a good thing for the overall business. And it's an area we're going to continue to focus on. We're going to make sure that we shore up the customers that we have today, but we're going to continue to sell. And proactively get conversions. Another big opportunity for us is fine as each other. I mean it really is a unique technology for us. It helps scoliosis patients in a way that they cannot get otherwise. And product is on fire. It's doing a great job, and it's extremely mission centric to the organization. So that just kind of gives you a general overview. Again, happy with both businesses.

We don't believe it's the requirement, though, for uptake. I really do believe that people see this as an opportunity to capture the data enter the data, be able to provide better care. A couple of things that I would say about that is this is just the beginning. We've got a very strong relationship with Canary. It's a relationship that will go on for many, many years. And it's not just a -- it's going to be for hip, it's going to be for shoulder. There's going to be a whole pipeline of technologies that we'll launch. So this is just the the beginning of the beginning, if you will, for sensors. And this idea of a close loop, being able to have my mobility applications in each of the areas that we play. Having smart implants as well, having ROSA applications, having at ortho Intel that connects to BAT across those. That is something that zedge ecosystem that we're going to use in each of the areas that we play. So we're pretty excited about it. And so I guess I'm enough to say, the remote patient monitoring reimbursement is a great thing to have.

So on the restatement, first of all, good to talk here, Robbie, we did do provide a little bit more color into what's happening in our base knee business. So you've captured the moving parts correctly. We provide a lot of detail as to what those comparisons are, we're not going to break it down much further. But if there are additional questions after this, our IR team is happy to go through any additional quarterly breakdown. But overall, we think that, that's a good move, especially in the backdrop of we hope are going to be some expanding and growing indications for ROSA robotics. So this will help clarify what's actually happening in those underlying indications relative to base business and capital sales. 
Cash flow, overall operating cash flows were about $245 million. With free cash flow at about $145 million. It was a little bit lower than we would -- that we had last year. Remember that first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters throughout the year. That's primarily because we have a lot of big payments I have in its first quarter around prior year rebates as well as employee bonuses. There are a number of other things that happened in the first quarter that's seasonally make that number lower. In this quarter, 2 key things. One is we built some excess inventory. So working capital is higher. We do see a market recovery coming later this year, and we want to make sure that we've got a sufficient supply to meet that market demand. So one, we think that, that was the right move. 
Secondly, from a working capital standpoint, receivables were a bit lower than expected. If you remember, we had a pretty low fourth quarter of last year that income or that cash comes in the first quarter of this year and because of those lower sales, you're seeing less cash receipts in the first quarter of this year. 
So again, not out of expectation for us, first quarter is generally lower. And those are some of the moving parts inside. And again, inventory being a better piece because we are excited about the recovery that's coming. We will, as you can see from our guidance, expect a step-up in overall cash flow through the rest of the year. I'd say it's more biased towards the second half of the year, and it's really predicated on 2 things: higher earnings relative to greater sales in the back half of the year, as we've talked about in our revenue guidance. And the second thing is we would expect to see some improvements in working capital and bringing those inventories down through the rest of the year as we work down that inventory we built this year in anticipation of the market recovery. 
So hopefully, that gives you some additional color on free cash flow."

It's different than -- you still have most people that get a hit procedure that ultimately feel like they don't even remember having it because it functions pretty well. Whereas a knee, as we always talk about, a good 20% of patients that are a little frustrated with the outcome because they don't get exactly what they expected. But on the hip side, because of that, most surgeons don't want to disrupt their flow, right? They don't want to take more time to do a procedure. And the key seems that we do for ROSA perspective to try to keep that surgeon flow that procedure flow, pretty consistent with what they're used to and not as a result of that, change the amount of time it takes to do a your procedure. And I think that will be a very important differentiator here. We're not going to change the time needed to do this. A couple of other things that will be different about this is it is a pinless application of robotics. It would be the first that we'll see in hip. Don't have to place these pins, basically drill into the bone of the leg to be able to have the robot know worth what the body is in space. So that's going to be unique to us. 
The other thing that we're going to focus on here is the application out of the gate is going to be for direct anterior approach, which we know is the fastest growth subcategory at hip right now. And it's a challenging procedure because you don't have great visualization, and it's difficult as a result of that, but it's a tough placement right. We're going to make both of those things easier through the rose application that we have. So we think the                 complete implants we think with this rose application, not taking more time to be able to do this, the pinless application and being able to allow people to see where they can see and place the cup where they need to place it is going to be a big deal. That's what we're betting on."

We had a really strong quarter, again, as I referenced, pretty similar to what we saw in Q4 of last year. I think I'm going to be a little cautious there because those are 2 exceptional quarters, and I feel very confident in our pipeline, but I wouldn't necessarily say that, that becomes a new trend. And those are great quarters for sure. And again, the pipeline is strong. And I would say that my confidence level is extremely high that the overall placements this year will definitely be more than last year. But I just don't want people to think that those quarters are going to be every quarter from here on out, even though the pipeline is pretty strong at this point. 
From a geographic mix standpoint, we continue to see really good traction in OUS. So I've been very pleased with that. Asia Pacific, in particular, but also Europe, Middle East and Africa. So it's been a good distribution around the world of robotic placements, which is one of the key things we wanted to concentrate on. So a really strong quarter. The pipeline is very strong, partial and ROSA, if are going to help us with that, obviously. And then the distribution is a positive for us. 
On the signature 1 planner, yes. I mean, we're excited about it. I mean, until every single procedure uses presurgical planning, we're not finished. We truly do believe it is a better way to care for patients. If you don't know what you're getting into relative to the anatomy, how can you be as prepared as you should be, to be able to do the procedure. So we want to make it easier for a surgeon to be fully prepared for that patient, knowing what they're going to deal with when they're in surgery and presurgical planning allows that to happen, right? And the real benefit to us is that, number one, we fill the mission of the organization because we're going to do a better procedure. We truly believe that. And number two, we get that cyber benefit of mix. 
More revenue per procedure because if you know the anatomy challenges you're going to be dealing with, you're probably going to be able to get augments ahead of time, and you're going to be able to ensure that you've got guides that you're going to need, and that's incremental spend. Appropriate spend, but incremental spend in the procedure. So that's the benefit for us. But just no, no matter what the increases that we talked about on a quarterly basis sequentially until we get 100% penetration, we're absolutely not finished there."

We don't want to provide specific breakdown of the mix, but just know that we've got multiple ways that you can place robotics and we -- trucks based on what the customer demand or need is, and we don't usually don't give any specific relative to what we did with RISA in a specific quarter. But again, I'll just reiterate the fact that it was a positive quarter for us in ROSA and it was a big benefit. And again, the most important thing isn't really the quarter that these are placed. It's the tailwind that they create on a go-forward basis because now you've got an opportunity to be able to build revenue around those robotic systems. And what we do when we place is you get a commitment to competitive conversions. But what we're finding is we're tracking this is that whatever we thought we were going to get we actually get more. And a lot of times, it's not even in the knee business. It's in other businesses that just kind of come to it. It's almost like, hey, look that it occurs. The product category. So it's always important to concentrate on, obviously, what happens in the quarter. But more than anything, it's the annuity value of this that occurs post that placement. 
And I'm just going to say, maybe with a quick close here, I know we get a spec over to you are, to close it out. But I just want to make sure that every focus, a little bit of attention. I know that there's a ton of focus right now on trying to predict the exact moment that the pandemic is behind us and as a result of that impact on 2021. And it's important to believe that we're spending a lot of time on it, too. But in reality, that's kind of a short-term thinking right now. And where I'm spending more of my time and the organization is spending more of our economics what does this look like post the pandemic when it truly is fully behind us. I kind of think about it in a few ways. Number one, right, the , the obvious thing is you're going to have a backlog of patients that's going to buoy the market growth for some period of time. I said before, I can't predict the amount of on that is, but there's clearly going to be at least a year or more of this backlog that when the pandemic is gone, it's going to be able to get this kind of extraordinary growth in the marketplace, and that's exciting. Although, not obviously sustainable beyond that. But there are other things that we're looking at now that truly give us a view that we could potentially reshape the curve of these -- the large joint growth market. And big things for us, kind of threefold in the way I think about it is there's no question this technology revolution is happening in orthopedics. We're going to help drive it, but others are doing it as well. And when that occurs, you're going to get a mix benefit. You're going to see revenue premiums for every procedure as this technology is adopted. And if you think about that over a 5- year period of time, as you get higher adoption that clearly has an opportunity to drive up the growth rates of the market. 
Now we got to do it. When you actually get it done, it doesn't happen. But the fact is, we at least see a pathway through technology advancements to be able to bend the curve of these growth markets. The other thing that it does, too, in my view, or could do. Is that there's some hurdles associated with having this type of an ecosystem, it's connected ecosystem, and that's going to create barriers to entry into the space where there really wasn't a lot before. And that gives you the byproduct benefit of longer-term contracts, deeper relationships with your customers and probably better pricing stability, right? So those are something else that we're looking at with this technology. And I think the third one, I think, is very important. As we get better outcomes for patients and their confidence level goes up for these procedures, I truly do believe there are patients on the sidelines today that should be getting the procedure, but are fearful of it. When you start to hear better outcomes, more technology, you may see some of those patients out of the pole. So again, all these things are potential building blocks. As we think about the future of orthopedics, it can make the space much more attractive. We've got to deliver on them. They're not guarantees. We got to make sure that it happens, but that's where we're focusing our attention now to make those things a reality. So I just want to leave you with those thoughts because that's an exciting future, I believe, for orthopedics. Keri, I'll turn it back to you."

And I also want to say thanks to everyone for joining us this morning for our call. And before we actually get into the Q1 numbers and our guidance, I just want to take a second to say that I certainly hope that all of you and your families are continuing to stay safe. We're obviously very pleased to see that so many people now have access, full access to the COVID-19 vaccinations, and that adoption has been pretty strong so far. 
Now of course, we'd like to see this even more broadly on a worldwide basis, but it certainly feels like we're making really important progress toward moving forward -- and ultimately, as a result of that moving, hopefully, on from the pandemic. Now it's not over. I think all of us realize that. But I, for one, feel more optimistic than ever that we're coming out, I think, on the other side of COVID-19. And with that, much better days ahead. 
And I guess with that, probably it's a good lead into our Q1 call. Q1 was a stronger quarter than we initially expected. And I'm pretty excited to discuss it with you. Whenever you have a good quarter, obviously, earnings calls are a lot more fun. So clearly, we're excited about this one. And I'm going to try to keep my remarks relatively brief this way. I know you're kind of laughing at that because it's not always easy for me to do that. I'm going to try to keep it brief. And that will give Suky an opportunity to walk you through what you're really interested in, which is the financial results for the quarter and really how that translates into our expectations for the full year 2021 guidance. And I also want to make sure that we leave time for questions, obviously. 
So I'm just going to stick to really 3 topics, as a result. Number one, I want to talk about the COVID recovery just briefly and our execution inside of that recovery. And then ZB's ongoing transformation and our progress against that. That will be the second topic. And the third topic would just be around our long-term growth strategy, just reiterating our position there and how we believe that's going to drive value for our shareholders and stakeholders overall. 
So let's start with navigating COVID and how we're executing inside of it. COVID clearly is not over, just as I stated a minute ago. And I'm very confident we're going to continue to have surprises ahead and disruptions ahead. But based on what we saw at the end of Q1 and what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2 and coupling that with just the pace of vaccine rollouts right now, we're clearly moving in the right direction. I don't think anybody can argue against that. And is that shift toward what I would define as more stability, and I know that's on a relative basis, kind of talk about stability here. But that shift towards more stability, it really enabled us to give you the full year 2021 financial guidance. 
Now inside of that guidance, there's going to be some important assumptions about trends and recovery timing that underpin our outlook, and Suky's going to get into more of that in just a few minutes. But overall, it feels good, feels good to have better insight into the broader market and greater confidence in what the rest of 2021 should look like for our business. 
Now as we start to return to a more normal environment, I'm going to put normal environment in air quotes given the situation right now. But when that happens, we expect that part of what we'll see is a pretty significant tailwind from the backlog of patients that has built up over the last year or more. Now how fast that happens, how fast we work through that backlog, especially across certain regions is something we're going to have to pay attention to. You're going to have to watch and track. But we absolutely believe that the vast majority of those patients who put off in elective procedure will come back into the funnel. And that's going to provide a significant tailwind well into 2022. And I, for one, cannot wait for that tailwind. And I can tell you that ZB is ready for them. They're ready for those patients, and we're ready to be able to help our customers, care for those patients. 
Speaking of being ready. As I've said to you before, the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, I truly think the team has executed against. I'm very proud of the ZB team for how they stood up and delivered against a backdrop of a whole lot of things that were absolutely out of their control. And I know I talk a lot about the importance of our talent, our mission, our culture here at ZB. And I can tell that each were absolutely critical for us in 2020 and continue to be in 2021 and well beyond. 
And with that in mind, we've made some additional changes to our leadership team here very recently. We've added a Chief Transformation Officer, again, to help us with all the transformation that we're going to continue to have as an organization. We've appointed a new Chief Human Resource Officer to help us move our talent agenda forward. One of the key areas of focus for me as we move forward as an organization, and promoting Sang Yi to group President of Asia Pacific. He's now going to have some responsibilities of certain projects, OUS. He brings a real disciplined execution mindset, and he can absolutely help us outside of Asia Pacific. And then expanding Ivan Tornos' role as a Chief Operating Officer with the added leadership now of EMEA, which is a region that he has had deep responsibility for in the past and knows very, very well, and I know it can bring us value in that region. 
So I can tell you is continued focus on talent and development is not just contained to the executive ranks. Our entire ZB organization is hyper-focused on our people. I'm really getting the right team members in the right roles and giving them the tools and support and really the opportunities to drive their performance, to develop and excel, and it's working. I can tell you, this focus on talent is working. And I believe it is going to continue to set us apart from the competition. 
And in addition to the foundation built by our team members, our mission, our culture, our core business momentum is stronger than ever. The team's execution continues to be on point. Our market momentum is building. Our commercial confidence is higher than ever. And I can say right now, we are very excited about the R&D innovation pipeline that we still have coming. That's an important part of our revenue growth. Throughout Q1 and even in recent weeks, we hit key milestones with our ZB products and our innovation. The application for Partial Knee now is available for ROSA. I was just approved by the FDA. We've actually already had our first procedure using that application last week with very good results. 
And this is just the latest addition to our ROSA robotics program, our platform here. And it's also another launch inside of our ZB edge suite of integrated digital and robotic technologies. Again, something we truly do believe will set us apart from the competition. 
So if I just look at ROSA overall in the quarter, we continue to see strong market demand traction with our ROSA platform. The Q4 performance was fantastic, and that continued right into Q1, both in the U.S. and internationally. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is very robust. And I can tell you that given our market share in Partial Knee, the partial application is only going to serve to bolster that going forward. 
For Persona Revision, another strong performance. This continues to move forward in an amazing way. Q1 was ahead of our expectations. And it is another example of a tip of the spear product that we have that as we make the conversion of provision, we also have the opportunity then to go after the standard knee business as well. So again, still exciting opportunities there for revision. 
And then our Signature ONE Planner for shoulder procedures, again, demonstrated a very strong sequential growth from Q4. We're actually up 65% over Q4 when we look at registrations. Again, that's a pretty significant move. And again, this provides that stickiness with our customers in that procedure, but it also provides a mix benefit wherever that presurgical planning is used. And as we come into Q2 and the rest of 2021, ZB has additional innovation that's coming. And it's pretty exciting innovation with our anticipated launch of Persona iQ and also ROSA Hip later in the year. 
And I can tell you, for Persona iQ, the initial feedback from evaluating surgeons has been very positive. And I can tell you that they're interested in being able to capture data from inside the body. I mean this is unique. They've not been able to do this before. And then ultimately, remotely monitoring those data the hope would be that using that information to change the way that we care for patients. 
So the excitement around this is very strong from our surgeons. And we can tell that the momentum is going to be strong when we do get regulatory approval. 
So all I have to say, the momentum on the innovation front is real here at ZB. This will allow us multiple shots on goal across a number of innovations. Again, with multiple robotics launches, continuing success with Persona Revision, Persona iQ, new iterations of mymobility and just really the broader ZB edge ecosystem to drive mix benefit, for sure, but also competitive conversions. And ultimately, we really believe, change the way that we care for patients, change the treatment paradigm for patients. That's really what it's about. It's about driving the mission of this organization. 
Truthfully to remove pain from patients around the world and improving the quality of their life. And we truly do believe ZB edge can help us do that. 
Okay. So let's move to the second topic that I have for you this morning, and that's the continued transformation of ZB. Now you've heard me talk about the 3 phases of transformation. The first was winning the hearts and the minds of the organization of the team members and really dealing with the execution challenges that we had that we spent a lot of time on in the first year. And then second was moving to that longer-term firm strategy for the organization that would drive innovation and really building the structure around that strategy and the operating mechanisms to ensure that we move it forward. 
And then third, where we are now is the portfolio transformation. And truly, that is where we sit that is squarely where we are positioned today in Phase III, these 3 phases. And we have the ZB portfolio management strategy and process in place. And we have definitely built out our capabilities to move forward in this phase. We're focused on what we're going to define as mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR accretive that would absolutely increase our weighted average market growth and does not disrupt our best-in-class margin profile. 
And as you've seen, we've moved this forward already with selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did last year. And that really does illustrate the strategy of work. Now those deals were smaller. No question, they're smaller, and they're relatively immaterial when it comes to the initial revenue that we acquired, but they're absolutely designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us in high-growth markets. Those high-priority markets and submarkets where ZB has a path to leadership, and we believe are right to win in markets like sports medicine, ASC and in the external closure market for us. And each of these deals gives us a gap filling and, we believe, differentiated product portfolio to drive growth, and that's important to growth, but also drive additional confidence in our ASC business category. 
And of course, inside of this active portfolio management phase, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental business that we discussed back in Q4. That process of creating 2 independent even stronger companies is on track. It's early days, obviously, but it is on track. And as you saw from our Q1 results, we do not believe it's causing distraction or disruption in our business. In fact, it's more the opposite. We've seen significant energy in the business, kind of a gelling in the business as the NewCo team starts to come together under CEO Vafa Jamali, and they begin to build out their own strategy and their focus. So again, it's early days, but we're very happy with the progress so far of this spin. 
All right. So that brings me to my third and final topic this morning really around our ZB plan to drive long-term growth and ultimately deliver value as a result of that growth. And I can tell you that we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. We've said before, we'll say it again that the spin-off of NewCo actually serves to de-risk and potentially accelerate our path to mid-single-digit growth and a best-in-class 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And we're confident that throughout this process and as we achieve this growth in margin profile, we're also going to have the flexibility to reinvest for growth. And that is a key thing for us. 
We've got to continue to be disciplined, but ultimately invest for growth in this business. And that's what we will continue to do. Now to get these growth levels and to achieve our top quartile performance in TSR, which, I think, you probably remember, is one of our strategic pillars, and we're going to continue to execute in our priority growth areas. And just as a reminder, that means that we expect to drive above-market growth sustainably in knees. We plan to grow hips consistently at market, but then later this year, above-market rates when we launched the ROSA Hip application. And we expect to stabilize, first and foremost, but also drive focus. And then ultimately, through that focus, drive our set business at the higher end of market rates there. 
We're also very focused on driving change for ZB, a real evolution of the company from a metal and plastic provider of implants to a leading med tech innovator. Think of us as a high-tech company that happens to be in med tech. That's the ZB brand that we're looking for, that brand evolution of this company. And I can tell you that already, more than 70% of our product development dollars are being spent in this area, being spent on ZB edge, that ecosystem of connected technologies. 
Now we're always going to be an implant company. And that's the center of the universe for this company. But the ZB edge ecosystem around it is the way that we can differentiate ourselves versus the competition. And we're already -- we have exclusive relationships to help us here. We have relationships already with Apple and several other tech companies that we truly do believe will drive future innovation that will delight our customers and ultimately benefit patients. 
And I believe, fundamentally, that this shift is coming, not only for us -- this technology shift, not only for us, but for the entire market that we play in them. And I truly do believe that the technology advancements potentially can reshape the growth curve of these markets. I'll say that again, I think the technology advancements that we're seeing and the value they bring can reshape the growth curve of the markets that we play in. And I think very importantly, also change the care paradigm for our customers and their patients. 
All right. Let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the ZB team and in our business momentum. And I truly believe that we are well positioned for success, and our strategy is working. Our transformation is well underway, and I'm excited about the value that we can drive for our shareholders on a go-forward basis. I truly in. 
And before I hand it off to Suky, I just want to take a minute to say thank you. Truly, thank you to the entire ZB team. Your vigilance and dedication to our safety protocols over the past year or so has been absolutely critical. And you're focused on our mission, our strategy and really just how you show up and execute every day, it's unmatched in my view, it truly is unmatched. You are what makes us ZB, I truly believe that. And what makes me confident really is you, that we can absolutely continue to deliver on all fronts. 
Okay. And so with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky. He's going to give you more financial details on the quarter, and obviously, most importantly, our expectations looking forward. Okay. Suky?"

As Bryan mentioned, our underlying fundamentals remain strong as does our confidence in our outlook. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics. First, our Q1 results, including commentary on the impact of",1376,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan mentioned, our underlying fundamentals remain strong as does our confidence in our outlook. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics. First, our Q1 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID; second, how that translates into our full year 2021 financial guidance that we provided this morning. And third, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth in 2022 and beyond. 
Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q1 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020, and my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Net sales in the first quarter were $1.847 billion, a reported increase of 3.6% and a constant currency increase of 80 basis points versus the same period in 2020. 
It's important to note that we had one fewer selling day, resulting in approximately 150 basis point headwind to consolidated revenue growth. Overall, consolidated and regional results were better than our initial expectations, as vaccine adoption continued to ramp up and pandemic pressure eased across most markets in March versus January and February. 
First, the Americas increased 1%. We continue to see variability by country, and while the region was in decline for most of the quarter, a sharp increase in U.S. procedures in March drove regional growth. As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 10.3% with all submarkets in decline. While we did see some recovery or decrease in COVID pressure as we move through the quarter, some markets continue to operate under recently enacted restrictions and actions that are limiting the near-term recovery of elective procedures. So we are continuing to monitor uptake very closely and expect that recovery in EMEA will lag other regions by 1 to 2 quarters. 
Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 15.5% with solid year-over-year growth across our 3 largest markets. Overall, we've seen a stabilization around COVID cases and surges in the region, but we continue to see some significant delays in recovery across India and other smaller markets. 
Turning to our business performance in Q1. Before jumping in, let me call out that we've updated our product category reporting to provide visibility into NewCo and to align products to categories based on how we internally evaluate performance of those businesses. 
Also, we have adjusted our historic reporting of revenue for these changes to assist in year-over-year comparisons. First, our ROSA robotics capital revenue has been moved from the knee's category to the other category. And our disposable revenue associated with robotic knee procedures have been moved from the other category into the knee category. This will allow us to more clearly indicate to investors the growth of our base knee business and sets us up for reporting once we launch ROSA Hip, which is currently expected in the second half of 2021. 
We've also broken out our global spine and dental revenues this quarter in conjunction with NewCo reporting. And as a result, CMFT is now included within S.E.T. The global knee business declined 5.2% versus Q1 2020, negatively impacted by ongoing pressure from COVID. Inside of that, we continue to see strong momentum from Persona and from ROSA Knee. 
Our global hip business increased 0.3%. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific continued their growth trends, increasing 0.9% and 11.2%, respectively. We continue to see strong demand and favorable feedback on the Avenir Complete hip with adoption from both gold and platinum accounts. 
Sports extremity and trauma increased 7.2%, driven by solid growth in upper extremities, trauma and CMFT. In S.E.T., we continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the Signature One surgical planning system for shoulder procedures. 
Our dental and spine segment grew 9.6%, fueled by outpaced recovery, especially in Dental. New products and better commercial execution also drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business and from Mobi-C and Tether within Spine. 
Finally, our other category was down 2.5%. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, our other category includes the contribution of ROSA Knee capital sales. 
Moving on to the P&L. In the first quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.71. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $2.46 last year. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue in the current period in tandem with prior year goodwill and product liability related charges. On an adjusted basis, EPS was up about 60 basis points driven by higher revenues, with operating margins down slightly compared to 2020 and a higher share count. The adjusted tax rate of 16% in the quarter was better-than-expected, driven by the realization of excess stock compensation benefit and other smaller discrete items. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. Overall, operating cash flows were $247 million and free cash flow totaled $137 million for the first quarter. We paid down an additional $200 million of debt and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $724 million. We continue to make good progress with another quarter of delevering the balance sheet. 
Moving to our full year outlook and financial guidance. While we continue to see pressure due to the global pandemic, vaccine rollout and adoption is approaching meaningful levels. Translating into a reduction of infection surges and hospitalizations in most markets. This increased stability gives us greater confidence that we'll return to normalized market growth in our key markets within the year and also begin to see deferred patients reenter as an added tailwind. As a result, today, we provided financial guidance based on our latest expectations, and that is underpinned by 2 key assumptions: First, current vaccine adoption trends continue to strengthen, driving a decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases through 2021; and second, hospitals increase capacity to work through some portion of patient backlog this year. 
Against that backdrop, our current expectations for full year 2021 financial results are reported revenue growth of 14% to 17% versus 2020 with an expected foreign currency exchange tailwind of approximately 150 basis points. Adjusted operating profit margins of 26.5% to 27.5%, an adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.50 to $8 and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Inside of that guidance, we expect to see seasonality in revenues in '21 that begins to resemble pre-COVID cadence. 
Additionally, our investments in R&D and key commercial initiatives will increase throughout the year. However, we do expect operating margins to improve as we exit 2021 as a result of higher revenues. Net interest expense is expected to step up about 5% versus 2020, and we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 211 million shares for the full year. 
Of course, we will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the year. 
Let me now turn to our long-term growth profile. We continue to expect our structural organic revenue growth rate to accelerate to the mid-single-digit range, with adjusted operating margins of at least 30% as we exit 2023. We're confident in our expectations as a result of the following proof points. First, we have been delivering consistent strong performance versus the market. Second, we have the best new product pipeline in the company's history that will complement an already robust portfolio. And third, our global team members continue to ramp up execution across our strategic priorities. 
In addition, our previously announced transformation initiatives are progressing well, and the addition of a Chief Transformation Officer has the potential to drive even greater investment opportunity for growth while maintaining a leading margin profile. 
To summarize, we are pleased with our better-than-expected revenue performance in Q1. While we anticipate and are prepared for ongoing short-term market uncertainty due to COVID and remain sensitive to ongoing challenges in a number of markets, from a financial standpoint, we believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us and look forward to improving results as we execute on our strategy. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri."

So I would say, it's not as simple math, is that, but it's pretty close, right? I mean, because you've got to remember, certain portions of our business would not have patients that would have a disease state that continues to -- that they have to deal with. And so not all of our revenue then is linked to procedures that have been deferred. But if I take those that are, and we also have kind of a percentage that we would assume will drop out of the funnel, we still have a very sizable backlog, hundreds of millions of dollars. So maybe not quite the number you're referencing, but the math logic makes sense when you peel out some of those other pieces. 
Now relative to the cadence or state at which we're going to digest those patients. It's difficult to predict. I mean we've never experienced anything of this size and magnitude and global impact. And so I don't know that I have a perfect proxy to determine how quickly we can actually work through that backlog of patients. 
But my general feeling is easy to look at just historical views of this, although much smaller and different, it's usually 12 to 18 months. You typically work through a backlog funnel. My guess is it will take at least that long, given the size and the magnitude of the backlog that we're talking about here. And it's going to be different. It's going to be different depending on where you are in the world. Certain places in the world will move that backlog through much faster in other places that will go a lot slower because the incentives are not there just to be able to digest again that patient flow as quickly. 
So again, I guess the takeaway is it should be a very large backlog of patients that will be pretty substantial dollars for us to be able to take advantage of as a tailwind, but the timing of that, the speed at which we work through is we're just not sure yet."

Versus 2020, we we were up -- sorry, just under 100 basis points versus the prior year, better than our commentary earlier in the quarter, where we expect to be down low to mid-single digits, and that was really because of the sharp uptake, as I talked about in March, primarily in the U.S., and we saw greater stabilization, faster stabilization in Asia Pacific than we expected. That more than offset a lingering headwind or below expectation for EMEA. 
Versus 2020, things get a little bit choppy because of the comparisons to prior year in COVID. But if you look at Q1 versus 2019, we were down, that implies about 8%. And as we exited March, we were also down versus 2019. 
Now our guidance moving forward, when compared to 2019, assumes sequential improvement in growth rate in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So far, as we've entered into Q2, we've got confidence in that shaping for Q2. We expect to exit the second quarter at about 2019 levels, not for the full quarter, but as we exit. And inside of that, we expect Asia Pacific to be above Q2 of 2019. The Americas about flat to slightly up, and EMEA continuing to lag. 
And again, the early start that we've seen so far in the second quarter gives us positive proof points and confidence that we'll see that sequential step-up in the second quarter."

So I think we're really well prepared for the commercialization. But at the end of the day, you can't do anything until you get the FDA approval. So that's what we're waiting on. And when we get that, we'll be moving forward. 
My guess is we'll be able to launch this over the next handful of months. But what I would just emphasize is, this is a unique launch for us. It's first of its kind. We're going to take our time. We're going to do a limited launch this year. I would expect material revenue in 2021. The full launch would really come towards the end of 2021 or 2022. 
But we really want to make sure that we're concentrating on a few customers. Going deep with those customers, really understanding the data capturing the value that it brings. So then from there going in a more widespread way. Now if we pick up information quickly and our confidence level grows more quickly than we're expecting, then you could see a difference this year than what I'm predicting right now.

I mean the most -- to be in to look at this is, first of all, absolutely, iQ was part of that spend that I talked about for the ZB ecosystem, right? And we think about ZB edge. It is a very unique part of it, too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're an implant company. This is where our operating butter is, for sure. But what we want to do is we want to elevate beyond that and make sure that we've got an ecosystem around it. 
In iQ, although extremely important in that is a variable in the overall equation. You still got my mobility that we connect with iQ, which would connect with ROSA and OrthoIntel is kind of a backdrop to that and would allow us to be able to collect data on a patient before surgery, interoperatively, post surgery and then be able to use those data ultimately to change the way of care for the patient. And that's what's so exciting about it. 
And so I think you can't really compare this to a typical knee implant or another implant and the timeline it might take up to drive real traction or materiality in the market because it's that unique. It is -- it really is a connection point to this broader capability that just does not exist today. So it will be interesting to see. 
We've got a pretty ambitious plan that we have in front of us. And the feedback so far from our evaluating surgeons has been very strong. And just generally in the marketplace, this desire to have data and be able to use the data to have better insights to be able to provide different care, better care is real. 
And ultimately, what we're so excited about is as we collect data right out of the gate, we're first to market, obviously, with a smart implant. But as we collect data, we'll stay out ahead of folks because that data is really where the magic is. The implant is interesting. You can listen to it right away. But as you collect a certain amount of data over a period of time, that is actually what provides the insights that are going to matter in the future. And so that gives us an opportunity to stay ahead. 
So we're very excited about it. It is part of that R&D spend, and we believe that it has the opportunity to have a better ramping curve than a typical implant just because it's so unique."

Inside of that, we would expect, if you look at sort of the midpoint of our guidance range, that, first of all, we expect COVID to continue to lever in many markets within the second half of the year. 
But broadly, offsetting that will be some additional capacity that comes through hospital systems in other markets to basically net that out. And that's not uncommon. We saw that in the third quarter of last year when you look at our results as COVID will stabilize and you saw hospitals actually increase their capacity to start to bring that backlog through. So again, at the midpoint of our range, we kind of assumed that lingering COVID is out there in certain markets, but that's offset by additional capacity in other markets. So net net, you're effectively keeping your backlog steady. 
Towards the bottom end of our range, we assume that COVID has a bigger impact on that backlog pull-through. And at the upper end of our range, we assume that backlog capacity more than exceeds the COVID pressure that we expect to see lingering through the second half of the year. So that's kind of how we see it. Again, we did see those proof points in the third quarter of last year. And as we expect to see pull-through through this year on the backlog, we expect it to resemble very much what we saw in the third quarter of last year."

I won't give specifics between the 2 businesses, but just know that both businesses did better than we expected in the quarter. Dental definitely was the stronger of the 2. But we know we're excited about seeing that progress. And it was a big important quarter for us because, remember, this is really the first full quarter when the organization knew about the spin, really understood the spin. And there was always that risk, obviously, when you announce something like that, there could be some disruption. And as you can tell, we're not seeing disruption, if anything, we're actually seeing momentum, which is great. 
But I would say on the cervical disk side, I kind of like the idea of others entering the market because, ultimately, I truly do believe the cervical disc is a better way to go to fusion. And so if we have more people entering the space, talking about it. I think we've got an opportunity to convert more of the business that's out there today in fusion. That's really the target. 
If we can increase the size of the cervical market, that's a good thing for everybody, good thing for patients, good thing for the overall business. And it's an area we're going to continue to focus on. We're going to make sure that we shore up the customers that we have today, but we're going to continue to sell. And proactively get conversions. Another big opportunity for us in spine is tether. I mean it really is a unique technology for us. It helps scoliosis patients in a way that they cannot get otherwise. And product is on fire. It's doing a great job, and it's extremely mission-centric to the organization. So that just kind of gives you a general overview. Again, happy with both businesses. Dental was stronger in the quarter, but spine did well as well."

We don't believe it's the requirement, though, for uptake. I really do believe that people see this as an opportunity to capture the data, enter the data, be able to provide better care. 
A couple of things that I would say about that is this is just the beginning. We've got a very strong relationship with Canary. It's a relationship that will go on for many, many years. And it's not just a -- it's going to be for hip, it's going to be for shoulder. There's going to be a whole pipeline of technologies that we'll launch. So this is just the beginning of the beginning, if you will, for sensors. And this idea of a close loop is being able to have mymobility applications in each of the areas that we play. Having smart implants as well, having ROSA applications, having at orthoIntel that connects the dots across those. That is something that ZB edge ecosystem that we're going to use in each of the areas that we play. 
So we're pretty excited about it. And so I guess I'd love to say, the remote patient monitoring reimbursement is a great thing to have. And I think it's warranted, but it's not the reason why we believe we're going to get uptake in this. We truly do believe it's a data to capture and what that data can tell us is what's going to drive it."

So on the restatement, first of all, good to talk here, Robbie, we did do provide a little bit more color into what's happening in our base knee business. So you've captured the moving parts correctly. We provide a lot of detail as to what those comparisons are. We're not going to break it down much further. But if there are additional questions after this, our IR team is happy to go through any additional quarterly breakdown. 
But overall, we think that, that's a good move, especially in the backdrop of we hope are going to be some expanding and growing indications for ROSA robotics. So this will help clarify what's actually happening in those underlying indications relative to base business and capital sales. 
Cash flow, overall operating cash flows were about $245 million. With free cash flow at about $145 million. It was a little bit lower than we would -- that we had last year. Remember that first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters throughout the year. That's primarily because we have a lot of big payments I have in its first quarter around prior year rebates as well as employee bonuses. There are a number of other things that happened in the first quarter that's seasonally make that number lower. 
In this quarter, 2 key things. One is we built some excess inventory. So working capital is higher. We do see a market recovery coming later this year, and we want to make sure that we've got a sufficient supply to meet that market demand. So one, we think that, that was the right move. 
Secondly, from a working capital standpoint, receivables were a bit lower than expected. If you remember, we had a pretty low fourth quarter of last year that income or that cash comes in the first quarter of this year and because of those lower sales, we're seeing less cash receipts in the first quarter of this year. 
So again, not out of expectation for us, first quarter is generally lower and those are some of the moving parts inside. And again, inventory being a better piece because we are excited about the recovery that's coming. 
We will, as you can see from our guidance, expect a step-up in overall cash flow through the rest of the year. I'd say it's more biased towards the second half of the year, and it's really predicated on 2 things: higher earnings relative to greater sales in the back half of the year, as we've talked about in our revenue guidance. And the second thing is we would expect to see some improvements in working capital and bringing those inventories down through the rest of the year as we work down that inventory we built this year in anticipation of the market recovery. 
So hopefully, that gives you some additional color on free cash flow."

I mean, if I think about it, the way I would think about this is the in hip. You've got pretty good outcomes right now. It's different than -- you still have most people that get a hit procedure that ultimately feel like they don't even remember having it because it functions pretty well. Whereas a knee, as we always talk about, a good 20% of patients that are a little frustrated with the outcome because they don't get exactly what they expected. 
But on the hip side, because of that, most surgeons don't want to disrupt their flow, right? They don't want to take more time to do a procedure. And the key seems that we do for ROSA perspective to try to keep that surgeon flow, that procedure flow pretty consistent with what they're used to and not as a result of that, change the amount of time it takes to do a your procedure. And I think that will be a very important differentiator here. We're not going to change the time needed to do this. 
A couple of other things that will be different about this is it is a pinless application of robotics. It would be the first that we'll see in hip. Don't have to place these pins, basically drill into the bone of the leg to be able to have the robot know worth what the body is in space. So that's going to be unique to us. 
The other thing that we're going to focus on here is the application out of the gate is going to be for direct anterior approach, which we know is the fastest growth subcategory at hip right now. And it's a challenging procedure because you don't have great visualization, and it's difficult as a result of that, but it's a tough placement right. We're going to make both of those things easier through the ROSA application that we have. So we think the -- we have complete implants. We think with this ROSA application, not taking more time to be able to do this. The pinless application and being able to allow people to see where they can't see and place the cup where they need to place it is going to be a big deal. That's what we're betting on."

So it's been a good distribution around the world of robotic placements, which is one of the key things we wanted to concentrate on. So a really strong quarter. The pipeline is very strong, partial and ROSA, if are going to help us with that, obviously. And then the distribution is a positive for us. 
On the Signature One planner, yes, I mean we're excited about it. I mean until every single procedure uses presurgical planning, we're not finished. We truly do believe it is a better way to care for patients. If you don't know what you're getting into relative to the anatomy, how can you be as prepared as you should be, to be able to do the procedure. So we want to make it easier for a surgeon to be fully prepared for that patient, knowing what they're going to deal with when they're in surgery and presurgical planning allows that to happen, right? And the real benefit to us is that, number one, we feel the mission of the organization because we're going to do a better procedure. We truly believe that. And number two, we get that cyber benefit of mix. 
More revenue per procedure because if you know the anatomy challenges you're going to be dealing with, you're probably going to be able to get augments ahead of time, and you're going to be able to ensure that you've got guides that you're going to need, and that's incremental spend. Appropriate spend, but incremental spend in the procedure. So that's the benefit for us. But just no matter what the increases that we talked about on a quarterly basis sequentially until we get 100% penetration, we're absolutely not finished there."

But again, I'll just reiterate the fact that it was a positive quarter for us in ROSA and it was a big benefit. And again, the most important thing isn't really the quarter that these are placed. It's the tailwind that they create on a go-forward basis because now you've got an opportunity to be able to build revenue around those robotic systems. And what we do when we place is you get a commitment to competitive conversions. But what we're finding is we're tracking this is that whatever we thought we were going to get we actually get more. And a lot of times, it's not even in the knee business. It's in other businesses that just kind of come to it. It's almost like, hey, look that it occurs. The product category. 
So it's always important to concentrate on, obviously, what happens in the quarter. But more than anything, it's the annuity value of this that occurs post that placement. 
And I'm just going to say, maybe with a quick close here, I know we get a spec over to you, Keri, to close it out. But I just want to make sure that every focus, a little bit of attention. I know that there's a ton of focus right now on trying to predict the exact moment that the pandemic is behind us and as a result of that impact on 2021. And it's important to believe that we're spending a lot of time on it, too. But in reality, that's kind of a short-term thinking right now. And where I'm spending more of my time and the organization is spending more of our economics what does this look like post the pandemic when it truly is fully behind us. 
I kind of think about it in a few ways. Number one, the obvious thing is you're going to have a backlog of patients that's going to buoy the market growth for some period of time. I said before, I can't predict the amount of on that is, but there's clearly going to be at least a year or more of this backlog that when the pandemic is gone, it's going to be able to -- this kind of extraordinary growth in the marketplace, and that's exciting. Although, not obviously sustainable beyond that. 
But there are other things that we're looking at now that truly give us a view that we could potentially reshape the curve of these -- the large joint growth market. And big things for us, kind of threefold in the way I think about it is there's no question this technology revolution is happening in orthopedics. We're going to help drive it, but others are doing it as well. And when that occurs, you're going to get a mix benefit. You're going to see revenue premiums for every procedure as this technology is adopted. And if you think about that over a 5-year period of time, as you get higher adoption, that clearly has an opportunity to drive up the growth rates of the market. Now we got to do it. When you actually get it done, it doesn't happen. But the fact is, we at least see a pathway through technology advancements to be able to bend the curve of these growth markets. 
The other thing that it does, too, in my view, or could do is that there's some hurdles associated with having this type of an ecosystem, it's connected ecosystem. And that's going to create barriers to entry into the space where there really wasn't a lot before. And that gives you the byproduct benefit of longer-term contracts, deeper relationships with your customers and probably better pricing stability, right? So those are something else that we're looking at with this technology. 
And I think the third one, I think, is very important. As we get better outcomes for patients and their confidence level goes up for these procedures, I truly do believe there are patients on the sidelines today that should be getting the procedure, but are fearful of it. When you start to hear better outcomes, more technology, you may see some of those patients out of the funnel. So again, all these things are potential building blocks. As we think about the future of orthopedics, it can make the space much more attractive. We've got to deliver on them. They're not guarantees. We got to make sure that it happens, but that's where we're focusing our attention now to make those things a reality. So I just want to leave you with those thoughts because that's an exciting future, I believe, for orthopedics. 
Keri, I'll turn it back to you."

Thanks, Carrie, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our call this morning. As we're all aware, obviously, given the news recently, COVID is still very much with us, and we're watching it very closely, as you can imagine. But given that, even we've seen some real progress since our last call, and I think that's obvious to everybody. The world has not returned to normalcy yet, but travel is returning. We have more team members in our offices, and I am personally looking forward to attending the AAOS meeting in about a month in San Diego. 
So really looking forward to that meeting. We have a lot of great technology that we're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it's going to be a person again, finally. I want to thank, in that same vein, thank our team again for their dedication to safety, and really just across the board, their commitment to making all of our ZB manufacturing facilities and offices as safe as we possibly can. You, our team members are the driving force for this progress that we've seen in our own facilities and certainly in our communities as well. Also, I want to say that I hope in our investor community that you're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends. This is an opportunity for us to take advantage of some travel as we begin to turn to more of a normal environment, of course, not there yet, and we know this isn't happening consistently anyway in all regions. But overall, we are encouraged and we're doing our part to keep this moving forward. And every single day, we are supporting our customers and patients that they serve. We're doing this safely, obviously, but this is a big focus for us as a mission-driven organization to be there for our customers so they can complete the procedures that they have, and we can make sure that the patients receive the care that they deserve. 
And with that, I think it's a good lead into our Q2 call. Today, I'm just going to spend here in the beginning, just a few minutes on a couple of quick remarks, and then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to get right into a deeper view of our Q2 results. And I think most importantly, our 2021 guidance view on a go-forward basis. And then I'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product and pipeline highlights. I'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information. So just to set him up a little bit, overall, let me just say that our performance in the quarter improved meaningfully from the first quarter of this year, and that was pretty much across all regions and product categories. And as recovery from the global pandemic continued to take hold, we saw that recovery in our procedure is also moving in the right direction.  While we certainly anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we currently think it's going to be manageable by hospitals, and we expect that the recovery will continue to build sequentially throughout the second half of 2021. Again, not out of the wood yet, but we do believe, thanks to the hospital's ability to better manage these COVID patients and the vaccine rollout continuing, we believe it will be manageable through the back half of the year, again, moving in the right direction. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky for our financial update, and then I'll be back with you in a few minutes to close out the call before the Q&A."

For this morning's call, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results, walk through the updates we've made to our full year 2021 financial guidance and provide color around our current expectations for the third and fourth quart",1268,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results, walk through the updates we've made to our full year 2021 financial guidance and provide color around our current expectations for the third and fourth quarter. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Also, I'll provide constant currency revenue growth versus 2019 as we think that is a more relevant comparison for this quarter. 
Net sales in the second quarter were $2.027 billion, a reported increase of 65.3% and an increase of 60.7% on a constant currency basis versus the same period in 2020. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales were flat on a constant currency basis, and we did not have a material impact from selling days. Overall, consolidated and regional results were slightly better than the expectations we provided on our last quarterly call, with growth versus 2019 in the Americas and Asia Pacific and sequential improvement in EMEA. 
For the quarter, the Americas increased 68.3% or up 1.9% versus 2019. We continue to see variability by country within the region with the U.S. growing 66.2% or 3.3% versus 2019. EMEA grew 80.5% or down 7.3% versus 2019, with continued COVID pressure being a factor. We did see improvement in EMEA as we moved through the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year. Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 24.4% or 2.8% versus 2019 in spite of some unexpected headwinds. While the region has been largely stable in recent quarters, it was impacted late in the second quarter by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China. in advance of the rollout of volume-based procurement or VBP. In addition, we saw a resurgence and increase of COVID-19 in a number of markets, including Japan. 
Despite these headwinds, the region continued to post growth. Turning to our business categories. The global knee business increased 72.2% or down 6.3% versus 2019.  In the U.S., knees increased 77% or was flat versus 2019. While we are seeing sequential improvement in the recovery of procedural volumes in large joints,  the path back to normalized market growth is taking a bit longer than most expected. Still, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. 
Our global hip business increased 39.9% or down 2.8% versus 2019. In the U.S., hip grew 46.6% or up 3.1% versus 2019. Strong demand and favorable feedback continues for the Avenir Complete Hip, which continued adoption for both gold and platinum accounts. The sports, extremities and trauma category increased 53% or up 10.8% versus 2019, driven by solid growth in sports medicine, CMFT and upper extremities. We continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the Signature One surgical planning system for shoulder procedures. 
Our dental and spine category grew 69.4% or up 0.8% versus '19, fueled by recovery in dental. New products and better commercial execution drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business. 
Finally, our other category grew 105.9% or up 7.5% versus '19. This reflects the ongoing demand for ROSA Robotics and strong capital purchases in the quarter. We saw improvements both sequentially versus Q2 2020 in units sold as well as increased revenues from software due to the launch of our partial knee application. 
Moving on to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.67. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, offset by normalized spending levels and IPRD investments within the quarter. 
In addition, the second quarter of 2020 had some onetime GAAP charges that did not repeat. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.90 was significantly higher than the prior year, driven as expected by the recovery of elective procedures since the pandemic trough in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7% and in line with expectations. Our adjusted operating expenses of $923 million stepped up sequentially versus the first quarter due to higher variable selling expenses related to higher sales and increased discretionary spending to support investments in commercial infrastructure and innovation through R&D. Improved revenue performance and stable gross margins more than offset higher spending to drive 26.2% operating margins, a slight improvement over the first quarter of this year. The adjusted tax rate of 16.5% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. For the quarter, operating cash flows were $453.9 million, and free cash flow was robust at $358.7 million, and we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of just over $1 billion. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to make another $300 million in debt repayments in the third quarter. Moving to our financial guidance. As noted in this morning's press release, we have updated our full year 2021 outlook. We are tightening our guidance range to better reflect our year-to-date performance and a more informed view of the potential impact of COVID. There are some key assumptions that underpin our 2021 financial guidance. We assume no worsening of elective procedure trends due to COVID and that procedure volume recovery continues in the second half of the year. but recovery may not be linear by region and/or by product category. We also expect to see seasonality impact to the third and fourth quarter as we have observed in prior years. With the narrowing of our guidance range, we are now expecting reported revenue growth to be 14.5% to 16.5% versus 2020, with the impact of foreign currency unchanged at about 150 basis points of a tailwind for the full year. 
On a constant currency basis, compared to 2019, we expect Q3 to grow sequentially over Q2 and for that improvement to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the P&L. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share is now in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, and we have narrowed our adjusted operating margin projection to be 26.5% to 27% for the full year. Our updated EPS guidance reflects our performance to date, our expectation of improved growth in the second half and that discretionary operating expenses remained consistent with Q2 through the balance of the year. While operating margins are expected to decline sequentially in the third quarter, in line with lower sales revenue and steady investment levels versus the second quarter, we expect overall second half operating margins to be stronger than first half operating margins. 
Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5% for the full year. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. 
We will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the remainder of the year. 
To summarize,  our performance in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations that we have communicated to you through the second quarter. While we anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we have more confidence in the momentum of the recovery and our ability to execute against that backdrop. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

And I'm going to now just hit 3 topics before we move to Q&A. First, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress ag",1505,"All right. Thanks, Suky. And I'm going to now just hit 3 topics before we move to Q&A. 
First, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress against active portfolio management, which is a big effort for us, obviously; and then third is innovation. And inside of that innovation, how we believe we're going to be able to drive attractive long-term growth that ultimately will deliver value to you, our shareholders. So let's start with our team's execution. And I've said this before, and I'll continue to say it, that the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, 1.5 years, the team -- they've executed against it, they delivered against it. And I'm very proud of the team for doing that during a time of significant turbulence around them. And in Q2, in the recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our solutions. ROSA for Partial Knee was approved back in April, as we've talked about before. and our first patient surgery was actually performed early in the quarter, and we've continued to see good traction with that technology so far and great feedback so far.  And it's important for us because partial knees, I think most of you know, is a market where ZB has a sizable market share position. So we're very excited about the possibilities here, not just from a revenue standpoint, but also the potential impact for patients in the surgery area. 
And then if I just look at ROSA overall, we did see another strong quarter in Q2 of market demand and traction with ROSA total knee as well with placement momentum broadly continuing across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well. And that's important. We want to see strength in the U.S., but we want to see that oUS, and we did get to see that kind of mix again in Q2.  
We also saw capital expenses for our customers being much stronger in Q2 and -- And as a result of that, we saw a shift back to upfront sales of ROSA. So more of those happened in Q2 than what we would typically see. And again, that just speaks to the strength of capital budgets and people's desire to acquire in that way. But what is clear is that there's a real focus for hospitals to be bringing in robotic systems for their ORs whether they buy them outright or they get them through other arrangements. Either way, that momentum, that demand is very real. And ROSA continues to be a cornerstone, one of the key ones, of our ZBEdge suite of connected solutions. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is going to be robust as a result of that because that's a big part of our strategy. So again, a lot of enthusiasm on what that will mean in coming years in terms of expansion of indications. and overall robotics penetration for ZB. 
Also in the quarter, we saw a revision continue its very strong momentum. Again, this is a great tip of the spear product for us, where we can go in and get competitive conversions and revision but also use those competitive conversions for access to the typical total knee as well for that surgeon. So very exciting, not just on the revision side but also opening the door to a much larger opportunity to get their typical knee conversion as well. 
We're also excited about adding another key variable to our ZBEdge portfolio of connected technologies, and that is our Persona iQ, which will be the first and only smart implant on the market. And we certainly still have to get FDA approval on that. We're working diligently with them to help with any information they need to move that forward, and we're certainly hoping to receive approval in the relatively short term. But ultimately, again, that time line is up to the FDA. And it's important for us because it takes the Persona implant, which is that known and trusted design in an implant and it combines it with Canary Medical's tibial extension, which has the sensor technology in it. And the combination of those 2 things will now inside the body, give us an opportunity to measure the range of motion of that patient, step count, walking speed and other mobility metrics that we believe are going to be indicators of post-surgery progress. So again, helping us close the loop in those connected technologies that we have in ZBEdge  -- So more to come when we hear back from the FDA. But once we do get that approval, we would look to limited launch the technology for a quarter or 2 and then post that time frame, move into full launch. 
Okay. So let's move to my second topic that is on active portfolio management. and our efforts around active portfolio management. We have the ZB portfolio management strategy in place. We have the right process in place, and we have definitely built our capabilities to move this forward over the last 1.5 years to 2 years. So we're excited about this phase of the organization. And we're focused, as we said before, on mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR-accretive. So in other words, weighted average market growth accretive to the organization. And you've seen us move this forward already with the selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did late last year that really illustrate our strategy at work. These are smaller deals, again, tuck-in size deals that were designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us as an organization in high-growth, high-priority markets like sports medicine, ASC and sternal closure where we truly do believe we have a right to win in attractive markets with strong profitability. 
And of course, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental businesses that is fully underway and on track. We continue to be encouraged by the energy and the momentum around NewCo. As CEO of Apa Jamali, builds out his team and refines his corporate strategy, and we believe creates 2 independent and even stronger companies that is going to maximize value for not just our customers, but also for you, our shareholders. 
All right. And that brings me to the last topic that we have before we move to the Q&A, and that's going to be around innovation. And really inside of innovation, how we see our ability to drive attractive long-term growth that will ultimately deliver value to all of our stakeholders, including you, obviously, our shareholders. 
We are focused on evolving ZB from what I would define as a metal and plastic provider of implants into a leading med tech innovator. And we have a lot of shots on goal across a number of programs to do this, including a number of robotics launches over the near term, smart implants that we have today, but also the technology road map that we have in smart implants.  New functionality with mymobility and really just the broader ZBEdge ecosystem of those connected technologies that are going to help us drive mix benefit and share of wallet benefit, but also competitive conversions. 
And I've mentioned before,  more than 70% of our new product development investment is directed towards ZBEdge and those connected technologies inside of ZBEdge.  And our exclusive partnership with Apple continues to be productive and collaborative. And we forged several other tech alliances that we know are going to drive future innovation that will benefit patients. And I believe this fundamental shift is coming for ZB and for our core markets with technology advancements, potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future, and that's really what our focus is. 
So the momentum is real on the innovation front. And we think it will ultimately allow us to drive long-term growth that is very attractive to us and to you. And most importantly, it also gives ZB the chance to really change the lives of patients around the world. 
All right. And let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the ZB team and our business momentum. While there continues to be uncertainty due to the global pandemic that we cannot control, I truly believe that we are ready and well positioned for success. And our strategy is absolutely working. The transformation of our business is well underway, and I'm excited about the value we can drive for our shareholders on a go-forward basis. 
Now I also want to make sure that I take the time to thank the entire ZB team. Your dedication to safety is critical and your focus on delivering on our mission is unmatched and you do it daily. I remain incredibly proud of what we're accomplishing and what we're accomplishing together. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Keri for our Q&A session. Keri?"

264048,1673156913,2360419,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Yes. No problem, Josh. Let me start maybe with the second part of your question because I would say beyond sensors, just what we define as ZBEdge, which is these interconnected technologies that actually do full data for the patient journey. We really do",502,"Yes. No problem, Josh. Let me start maybe with the second part of your question because I would say beyond sensors, just what we define as ZBEdge, which is these interconnected technologies that actually do full data for the patient journey. We really do believe that those technologies, including robotics, sensors in the body, My Mobility, Ortho Intel, so on and so forth, will absolutely bend the curve when it comes to growth rate in knees and hips in other areas as well because we would proliferate those beyond just knees and hips. So just I do believe that, that technology, which is being absorbed by the folks in Orthopedics right now does provide us an opportunity to enhance our growth rate as an organization for 2 reasons: one, because I do believe that we can get that share of wallet benefit or mix benefit for procedure; and two, I really do believe it sets us up to take share from the competition because it's unique to us. So yes, on the second question, I see that as being able to enhance our growth rate. 
When I think about the share, I'm pretty focused on this, as you would imagine.  This is something that in a turbulent market, we got to pay attention to it. And when I think about the last 5 quarters that we've seen we just had abnormally large spreads between the top and the bottom player in large joints. This speaks to just a very turbulent market that we're experiencing because of COVID. And inside of this, I'm ultra focused on share gains or losses because it's the very thing that would tell us whether we're performing well versus our competition because the market itself is difficult to understand. And I'm focused on this in regular times, but I'm ultra focused on it during turbulent times. 
And that said, in a normal market, I try not to get too excited or depleted based on any individual quarter performance. There's just too many variables inside of an individual quarter, particularly now. But what I do is to take a look at a rolling 4 quarters, and that's the way we do it every time we see results out. When I think about the rolling 4 quarters, particularly prior to Q2, we definitely took share in our large joint market. We didn't beat every competitor every quarter, but every quarter over the 4 quarters preceding Q2, we were ahead of market in both knees and hips. And that obviously gives us confidence as we move forward. So I really try to look at it with the data that's provided from the major companies that is public to all of us, and I just track that over a 4-quarter rolling period to determine whether we are we're not taking share. And I do believe that even though it's been positive for us over those 5 quarters, I do believe the technology that we're launching is going to enhance that going forward."

But I guess, discrete is focused more on near-term sequential trends here. Why would Simar perhaps be seeing different trends versus your peers? I think you made some comments about the backlog burn being a little bit slower, et cetera. Maybe put that in perspective for us? And my second question is, your ROSA, I think one of the key advantages of the system is ease of use, the higher throughput. Given there is a backlog, are you seeing increased traction here or customers appreciating this speed advantage of ROSA? And what does that translate to a total installed base or share gains perhaps for Zimmer?"

So maybe I'll start with the ROSA throughput. And as you probably remember, we spent a lot of time thinking about the design characteristics of ROSA is one of the primary things we want to focus on is to make sure that we did not disrupt the surgical flow and certainly did not want to add time to the surgical procedure. And that has benefited us. There's no question. I mean, to me, it wouldn't matter whether we're in a COVID environment or a non-COVID environment. That is something that our surgeons are pursuing. And they very much appreciate the fact that it's not disrupting their flow, and it's not dramatically increasing any the times to do procedures. So that is a benefit for us for sure. 
And again, I don't think it really matters whether you're in a COVID environment or not, that's just a benefit. One of the things relative to share gains that you talked about and our view on backlog, I don't know that our outlook and what we've described is really any different than anyone else who plays in large joints like us with such a significant share position. It seems pretty consistent with -- to me anyway. 
If I think about the deferred patients, I'd just say that like most people at this point, that just becomes more challenging now as time continues to be added to the equation.  It's just unprecedented right now that what we're dealing with, just given how long this has gone on. And there are just too many variables in my view, just to really size this appropriately, and I think anyone would probably say this now. But that said, we still believe that there's been no structural shift in the disease state. That's what we've been saying all along. And as a result of that, there's got to be a sizable deferred patient population out there. 
And when we originally analyzed what we thought would happen with that deferred population, we looked at Q3 of last year. And we assume that when -- based on what we saw in Q3, that when the vaccine was available, you would have a pretty significant return of deferred patients relatively quickly. And again, that's what we saw in parts of Q3 last year when the virus was subsiding. So we just assumed that would happen this year. 
Now fast forward today, the vaccine is here, and we've got more current data and more data points that are playing out right now. And this doesn't seem to be materializing for anybody. And as such, our current thinking is that deferred patient demand will like become at a more gradual pace and probably be more consistent over a longer-term period of time as a result. I think that's really what we're contemplating by the way. When you think about the midpoint of the revenue range that we just provided, the implied range for the back half of the year, but actually at the top of that range, as I think most people would say, we would need to see a change in the current pacing of that recovery. 
So in other words, you'd have to see it reflect an increase in deferred patient demand that would also be matched by capacity increases to get to that top end of the range."

And yes, my current thinking is based on the data points that are available to us, is that it's likely going to be a slower role with that deferred patient group coming in. And that would indicate that this should take a while for us to work through it. That could change at any time, but that's the data points that we have right now. relative to iQ, I'm glad that you're hearing there's pent-up demand because certainly, we're feeling that as well, and we're getting excited about the launch, the pending launch. And we still obviously cannot market the technology because we don't have FDA approval, but we do believe that, that should be coming soon. And yes, we're excited about it, but you do not actually need to have the full ZBEdge infrastructure to take advantage of it. What we would like to see people do is to have my mobility and the Persona iQ combined because we believe the combination of the data collection between those 2 is extremely beneficial, but you don't really even need that. But that would be the goal for us to have that move in concert and be able to have the mymobility in concert with the iQ implant. 
And we do feel that all the components are there for remote patient monitoring. That's the whole idea behind this. Through mymobility, through iQ is to be able to remote patient monitor. And as a result of that input provided, be able to make decisions on what you do or don't want to do with the patient. And so we believe that we have what would be required for a surgeon to get a reimbursement for RPM. That's the way we're looking at it today. At the end of the day, that's not our decision on whether it happens or not, but we do believe we have the components to make that available to surgeons."

I would just say that, yes, again, we're excited about the traction we're seeing. And as the way I look at this, it's not just the traction that we're seeing with ROSA, I'm excited because there seems to be a significant openness in orthopedics for technology. And that's really important, I think, for 2 major reasons. One, because I truly do believe the technology is going to change the care paradigm for patients. You're going to get better outcomes as a result of it. And when you have that happening, I believe more patients will enter the funnel because they're going to have higher confidence in the procedure. 
Remember, there's still 20% of me patients that are not happy with the outcome. And if we can reduce that through technology, I believe you've got patients sitting on the side that would enter the funnel, which is good for everybody, patient included. So I'm very happy to see momentum in ROSA, but I'm even happier to see technology adoption in orthopaedics overall. 
And when we think about our placements, it's interesting because we focus in 2 major areas. We spend most of our time in platinum accounts and gold accounts. And both of those would just be very large accounts. The difference between the 2 would be platinum. We have a higher share position. And in gold, we have a lower share position. But those are the 2 areas that we concentrate mostly with ZBEdge and ROSA. Now what's interesting about that though is even when we go into that platinum account, it's very rare that we would have a homogeneous knee usage in the account. So even when we get a platinum customer that is using us in knee, to move into ROSA, we typically get competitive conversions to ROSA because you have competitive surgeons in those accounts. And of course, in gold accounts, you get the same thing. 
So it's almost every placement that we have very rarely otherwise, provides an opportunity for us to get a competitive conversion. And hopefully, that helps with the way we're thinking about ROSA."

First half fortunately was a little bit better than the back half of last year, and so we're encouraged by that. We expect the second half of this year to be pretty much in line with the second half of last year, so very consistent with how we've previously guided.

I just -- when I think about what Suky just referenced that we've got a pretty significant assumption in our guidance range that says COVID pressure doesn't get worse and the recovery builds through the second half. But we didn't just assume that. There are some proof points that we're seeing, and that might speak to your question, Larry, maybe a little more. There's really kind of 2 things that we're seeing that would give us confidence in that assumption. And the first one is that even with the recent virus surges that are all over the news, I mean, you can't look at the news any time during the day and not see something about the virus surge, but it doesn't seem to be translating into the same significant revenue disruption that we've seen in the past and certainly not helping us, but it's not translating into that same kind of revenue disruption we've seen in the past. So -- and I believe that's likely because we've got more vaccines out there, obviously, which is impacting the way people feel when they get sick. But also, I just think that hospitals seem to be managing this patient population better. 
And the second kind of proof point for us when we thought about this as an assumption inside the guidance range, is that the vaccine is available. I mean let's face it. It's available globally anywhere. Anybody who wants it can get it. And I truly do believe even though it stalled a bit in certain parts of the world, I do believe as people get more educated on the Delta variant and the risk associated with that. That may be a good motivator for people to come in that have been waiting to actually get the vaccine. And so those are kind of the proof points that we have that give us confidence that we should see the continued recovery in the back half."

And in this quarter, we just saw that flip. The higher than 50% move to upfront purchases which is different than what we've seen in the past. What I don't know for sure is that that's going to continue. I mean clearly, there were budgets that were available to people, they flexed those budgets that could continue. Hey, I'm happy either way we place ROSA. We're going to be very flexible with our customers as we go forward and make sure that we're there to support them.

Yes, as we noted, Asia Pacific sales were impacted in the quarter really by 2 things. One is the VBP impact that we talked about, which was essentially some distributors taking some inventory contraction ahead of VBP. And the second was we did see surges late in the second quarter in some of our larger markets like Japan and Australia and New Zealand that also slowed some of our growth down. And that hit pretty much across both of those VBP as well as slowdowns in our recon business. But it was encouraging that despite those headwinds that we were able to manage through that and actually grow the region a little bit ahead of expectation. And we would expect that growth to continue in the back half of this year. 
Regarding China VBP, for competitive reasons, we're not going to size that. It was a contributor. We're not the only contributor in that performance in Asia Pacific, as I mentioned. I think the important thing is how do we think about this going forward? We've looked at VBP and done a number of scenarios based on what we know at this time. Again, the final rules, pricing and volumes aren't expected to be issued for let's call it another few months, but that timing has been shifting around, so it could continue to shift. 
But based on what we know today, we don't expect there to be a material impact from inventory change going forward. And that's what's represented in our guidance moving forward. But again, we're going to learn a lot more about VBP over the coming months, and we'll update you as we learn more. But again, it was great to see that Asia Pacific did grow through that. And I would say also, fundamentally within China, we're seeing very strong demand. And so obviously, that was the first market to be impacted by COVID-19, and it was the first market to recover, and we continue to see good strength and progression in that market. And as you know, we're a leader within China and expect to maintain that leadership position as we move forward."

For us, again, we did see that shift. We believe that it's mainly because people have more budget right now on the capital side. I don't see a shift in our customer base that drove it. 
So nothing that just stands out for me. It's just more that there was capital available. People like to flex the capital when they have it. And some customers just don't want the long-term contractual obligation, bringing a piece of capital in, they'd just rather buy it. And so I think that's really the corporate, there's nothing beyond that, that I've seen. Now we'll certainly pay attention to it as we go forward, but nothing that was disruptive in any way relative to mix that would have changed that change in placements."

So we continue to build out, I think, an attractive pipeline of potential tuck-in targets. Very consistent with what Bryan said earlier about things that are mission-centric where we have the right to win, strategically makes sense, financially are strong and have a low level of synergy disruption and very consistent with sort of the deals we did at the back end of 2020, which so far through the integration process, we're very pleased with how those are progressing. So we're going to continue to look at opportunities very similar to those. And the good thing is our firepower continues to build. And with the recovery of the pandemic, we're seeing our EBITDA improved significantly. We've turned the corner on the second quarter of 2020, which was a cliff for us, as you know, a trough, if you will, on EBITDA. And with a rolling 12-month EBITDA number as we sunset the second quarter of 2020, we're seeing a pretty big step up in our EBITDA number and a nice improvement in our overall leverage ratio. When you combine that with the debt paydown we've done so far, the debt paydown we're committing to in the back half of this year, and the over $1 billion on the balance sheet, we feel we're in a stronger position than we have been for the last 15 months to execute on that tuck-in M&A strategy. 
And so I feel really good about where we are and how we're moving forward on that. I would also say, another big component of that is our spin transaction. We're really pleased with how the team has been progressing on that. We've made significant progress with our tax private letter ruling, great progress with our carve-out financials and our 10x, which we hope to file in the not-too-distant future. with the SEC on a private basis. Good progress from BofA in formulating this go-forward strategy and building out his team. So just overall, really, really impressed with how the team has handled this in the backdrop of also integrating those transactions we did at the back end of last year. So that muscle, that capability that we've been building over the last couple of years is really playing out to our benefit right now."

What I would tell you is that the -- that's kind of the beauty of the situation why my confidence is high. that we're going to continue to see share gains as we have over the last 4 quarters spot. That's because we just have so many shots on goal. If you think about knee in particular, we already have ROSA out, and that's getting great traction. ROSA Partial was just launched.  Persona Revision has been out for a while, but the momentum is still very strong. And there is that spin-off opportunity to get the typical total knee. -- you still have my mobility driving conversions. You haven't even launched Persona iQ yet. So all of these give us an opportunity to create a differentiated environment for our customer and provide the opportunity for not only that share gain or mix game, but also competitive conversions. And specifically on revision, the reason why I bring it up is typically in somebody's practice, you get about 10% of the overall revenue associated with provision, and it's more like 90% comes from your typical total knee. 
And many times, we use that revision as a tip of the spear to convert a surgeon that is a competitive surgeon because they love the revision system.  And that gets us in the house then to try to pursue that much larger portion of the business, which is your standard knee. So that's why I keep going back to that, we have significant dollars now that we're paying attention to, where we have a revision customer that is using a competitive total knee system, and that gives us a great opportunity and kind of a hunting ground to go to, to get those conversions, but it's certainly not the only area that would give us the opportunity to take share. It's pretty much all of these."

And that's why I was referencing before when I look at share gain or loss, I never look at and spend too much time on a specific quarter, even when things are typical. But in these crazy times, so many things can impact your performance versus the market. So again, I try not to get too worked up about any given quarter. It could be. I mean the fact is share right now in a specific part of the country for instance, can be meaningful to whether you do better or worse than the competition because that particular state or county could be challenged by COVID more than others. So there's always those things that could impact a specific quarter. That's why when I look at over a 4-quarter period of time, that usually eliminates those hotspots. And that's why I feel more confident and more comfortable with more of that trend, which -- through that trend basically eliminates the noise, I'm going to put air quotes around the ""noise"" of a specific quarter. That's why I still feel confident that we're in good shape that we have all these shots on goal that we should continue to take share. But hey, I'm disappointed. I look at the quarter, I don't really care what the reason is. I want to win every single quarter and this one we didn't. But again, I'll look more at the trend and take more from that on the prediction of share taking in the future.

I just want to say, and I think this is probably obvious to everybody. We certainly have an outsized dependence on elective procedures versus really any of our med tech peers or competitors, particularly large cap companies. We're just an outsized impact there. And as a result, we're very sensitive to COVID ebbs and flows. And we spend a lot of time as you would imagine, analyzing this. And we try to remain prudent in our expectation setting as a result. And because we've seen it. We've seen it first hand that COVID can move our business pretty rapidly given that dependence on elective procedures. And this has been what was reflected in the updated guidance and why our implied range for the back half is still pretty wide because again, there are things that can happen here to move us up or down pretty rapidly because of that dependence on elective procedures. 
Now relative to Q2 specifically, and Suky said this before, even with some of the unexpected challenges that we had in the quarter, hey, we delivered better-than-expected results, which I think speaks to 2 very important things. Number one,  and this is more short term, but it's important, the recovery from COVID is moving in the right direction. Now it's definitely not happening the way we anticipated. I don't think it is for anybody.  But it's moving in the right direction, nonetheless. And the 2, and I think this is important, not just for now, but the long term, our team continues to execute and deliver against the things we can control and both of these things were deeply considered in our updated guidance. And this gives us confidence that continued recovery through the back half of the year is going to happen. And we see a path to end 2020 at 4% to 5% organic growth, at 4% to 5% we've been talking about without the need for any material benefit from clearing the deferred patient queue. And I got to say, given where we started just a few years ago,  and with COVID in between, with very flat to negative growth with consistent share losses as a company. I for one, is super proud of the team for putting ZB in this position. And I look forward to not just talking about it, but delivering it for you. our customers and our patients. Okay.

But given that even, we've seen some real progress since our last call, and I think that's obvious to everybody. The world has not returned to normalcy yet, but travel is returning. We have more team members in our offices, and I am personally looking forward to attending the AAOS meeting in about a month in San Diego.
So really looking forward to that meeting. We have a lot of great technology that we're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it's going to be in person again, finally. 
I want to thank, in that same vein, thank our team again for their dedication to safety, and really just across the board, their commitment to making all of our ZB manufacturing facilities and offices as safe as we possibly can. You, our team members are the driving force for this progress that we've seen in our own facilities and certainly in our communities as well. 
Also, I want to say that I hope in our investor community that you're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends. This is an opportunity for us to take advantage of some travel as we begin to turn to more of a normal environment, of course, not there yet, and we know this isn't happening consistently anyway in all regions. But overall, we are encouraged and we're doing our part to keep this moving forward. And every single day, we are supporting our customers and patients that they serve. We're doing this safely, obviously, but this is a big focus for us as a mission-driven organization to be there for our customers so they can complete the procedures that they have and we can make sure that the patients receive the care that they deserve. 
And with that, I think it's a good lead into our Q2 call. Today, I'm just going to spend here in the beginning, just a few minutes on a couple of quick remarks, and then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to get right into a deeper view of our Q2 results. And I think most importantly, our 2021 guidance view on a go-forward basis. And then I'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product in pipeline highlights. I'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information. 
So just to set him up a little bit, overall, let me just say that our performance in the quarter improved meaningfully from the first quarter of this year, and that was pretty much across all regions and product categories. And as recovery from the global pandemic continued to take hold, we saw that recovery in our procedures also move in the right direction. While we certainly anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we currently think it's going to be manageable by hospitals, and we expect that the recovery will continue to build sequentially throughout the second half of 2021. 
Again, not out of the wood yet, but we do believe, thanks to the hospital's ability to better manage these COVID patients and the vaccine rollout continuing, we believe it will be manageable through the back half of the year. Again, moving in the right direction. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky for our financial update, and then I'll be back with you in a few minutes to close out the call before the Q&A."

Overall, consolidated and regional results were slightly better than the expectations we provided on our last quarterly call, with growth versus 2019 in the Americas and Asia Pacific and sequential improvement in EMEA. 
For the quarter, the Americas increased 68.3% or up 1.9% versus 2019. We continue to see variability by country within the region with the U.S. growing 66.2% or 3.3% versus 2019. EMEA grew 80.5% or down 7.3% versus 2019 with continued COVID pressure being a factor. We did see improvement in EMEA as we moved through the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year. Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 24.4% or 2.8% versus 2019 in spite of some unexpected headwinds. While the region has been largely stable in recent quarters, it was impacted late in the second quarter by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China, and advance of the rollout of volume-based procurement or VBP. 
In addition, we saw a resurgence and increase of COVID19 in a number of markets, including Japan.  Despite these headwinds, the region continued to pose growth. 
Turning to our business categories. The global knee business increased 72.2% or down 6.3% versus 2019. In the U.S., knees increased 77% or was flat versus 2019. While we are seeing sequential improvement in the recovery of procedural volumes in large joints, the path back to normalized market growth is taking a bit longer than most expected. Still, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. 
Our global hip business increased 39.9% or down 2.8% versus 2019. In the U.S., hip grew 46.6% or up 3.1% versus 2019. Strong demand and favorable feedback continues for the Avenir Complete hip, which continued adoption for both gold and platinum accounts. The sports, extremities and trauma category increased 53% or up 10.8% versus 2019 driven by solid growth in sports medicine, CMFT and upper extremities. We continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the Signature ONE surgical planning system for shoulder procedures. 
Our dental and spine category grew 69.4% or up 0.8% versus '19, fueled by recovery in dental. New products and better commercial execution drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business.
Finally, our other category grew 105.9% or up 7.5% versus '19. This reflects the ongoing demand for ROSA Robotics and strong capital purchases in the quarter. We saw improvements both sequentially versus Q2 2020 in units sold as well as increased revenues from software due to the launch of our Partial Knee application.
Moving on to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.67. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, offset by normalized spending levels and [indiscernible] investments within the quarter. In addition, the second quarter of 2020 had some onetime GAAP charges that did not repeat.
On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.90 was significantly higher than the prior year, driven as expected by the recovery of elective procedures since the pandemic [ drop ] in the second quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted gross margin was 71.7% and in line with expectations. Our adjusted operating expenses of $923 million stepped up sequentially versus the first quarter due to higher variable selling expenses related to higher sales and increased discretionary spending to support investments in commercial infrastructure and innovation through R&D. Improved revenue performance and stable gross margins more than offset higher spending to drive 26.2% operating margins, a slight improvement over the first quarter of this year. The adjusted tax rate of 16.5% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to cash and liquidity. For the quarter, operating cash flows were $453.9 million, and free cash flow was robust at $358.7 million, and we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of just over $1 billion. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to make another $300 million in debt repayments in the third quarter. 
Moving to our financial guidance. As noted in this morning's press release, we have updated our full year 2021 outlook. We are tightening our guidance range to better reflect our year-to-date performance and a more informed view of the potential impact of COVID. There are some key assumptions that underpin our 2021 financial guidance. We assume no worsening of elective procedure trends due to COVID and that procedure volume recovery continues in the second half of the year. But recovery may not be linear by region and/or by product category. We also expect to see seasonality impact in the third and fourth quarter as we have observed in prior years. 
With the narrowing of our guidance range, we are now expecting reported revenue growth to be 14.5% to 16.5% versus 2020, with the impact of foreign currency unchanged at about 150 basis points of a tailwind for the full year.
On a constant currency basis, compared to 2019, we expect Q3 to grow sequentially over Q2 and for that improvement to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the P&L. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share is now in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, and we have narrowed our adjusted operating margin projection to be 26.5% to 27% for the full year. Our updated EPS guidance reflects our performance to date, our expectation of improved growth in the second half and that discretionary operating expenses remained consistent with Q2 through the balance of the year. 
While operating margins are expected to decline sequentially in the third quarter, in line with lower sales revenue and steady investment levels versus the second quarter, we expect overall second half operating margins to be stronger than first half operating margins. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5% for the full year. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the remainder of the year. 
To summarize, our performance in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations that we have communicated to you through the second quarter. While we anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we have more confidence in the momentum of the recovery and our ability to execute against that backdrop.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

And I'm going to now just hit 3 topics before we move to Q&A. First, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress agai",1502,"All right. Thanks, Suky. And I'm going to now just hit 3 topics before we move to Q&A. First, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress against active portfolio management, which is a big effort for us, obviously; and then third is innovation. And inside of that innovation, how we believe we're going to be able to drive attractive long-term growth that ultimately will deliver value to you, our shareholders. 
So let's start with our team's execution. And I've said this before, and I'll continue to say it, that the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, 1.5 years, the team -- they've executed against it, they delivered against it. And I'm very proud of the team for doing that during a time of significant turbulence around them. And in Q2, in the recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our solutions. ROSA for Partial Knee was approved back in April, as we've talked about before. And our first patient surgery was actually performed early in the quarter, and we've continued to see good traction with that technology so far and great feedback so far. And it's important for us because partial knees, I think most of you know, is a market where ZB has a sizable market share position. So we're very excited about the possibilities here, not just from a revenue standpoint, but also the potential impact for patients in the surgery area. 
And then if I just look at ROSA overall, we did see another strong quarter in Q2 of market demand and traction with ROSA total knee as well with placement momentum broadly continuing across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well. And that's important. We want to see strength in the U.S., but we want to see that OUS, and we did get to see that kind of mix again in Q2.  
We also saw capital expenses for our customers being much stronger in Q2 and -- And as a result of that, we saw a shift back to upfront sales of ROSA. So more of those happened in Q2 than what we would typically see. And again, that just speaks to the strength of capital budgets and people's desire to acquire in that way. But what is clear is that there's a real focus for hospitals to be bringing in robotic systems for their ORs whether they buy them outright or they get them through other arrangements. Either way, that momentum, that demand is very real. 
And ROSA continues to be a cornerstone, one of the key ones, of our ZBEdge suite of connected solutions. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is going to be robust as a result of that because that's a big part of our strategy. So again, a lot of enthusiasm on what that will mean in coming years in terms of expansion of indications, and overall robotics penetration for ZB. 
Also in the quarter, we saw Revision continue its very strong momentum. Again, this is a great tip of the spear product for us, where we can go in and get competitive conversions and revision but also use those competitive conversions for access to the typical total knee as well for that surgeon. So very exciting, not just on the revision side but also opening the door to a much larger opportunity to get their typical knee conversion as well. 
We're also excited about adding another key variable to our ZBEdge portfolio of connected technologies, and that is our Persona iQ, which will be the first and only smart implant on the market. And we certainly still have to get FDA approval on that. We're working diligently with them to help with any information they need to move that forward, and we're certainly hoping to receive approval in the relatively short term. But ultimately, again, that time line is up to the FDA. 
And it's important for us because it takes the Persona implant, which is that known and trusted design in an implant and it combines it with Canary Medical's tibial extension, which has the sensor technology in it. And the combination of those 2 things will now inside the body, give us an opportunity to measure the range of motion of that patient, step count, walking speed and other mobility metrics that we believe are going to be indicators of post-surgery progress. So again, helping us close the loop in those connected technologies that we have in ZBEdge. So more to come when we hear back from the FDA. But once we do get that approval, we would look to limited launch the technology for a quarter or 2 and then post that time frame, move into full launch.
Okay. So let's move to my second topic that is on active portfolio management, and our efforts around active portfolio management. We have the ZB portfolio management strategy in place. We have the right process in place, and we have definitely built our capabilities to move this forward over the last 1.5 years to 2 years. So we're excited about this phase of the organization. And we're focused, as we said before, on mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR-accretive. So in other words, weighted average market growth accretive to the organization. And you've seen us move this forward already with the selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did late last year that really illustrate our strategy at work. These are smaller deals, again, tuck-in size deals that were designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us as an organization in high-growth, high-priority markets like sports medicine, ASC and sternal closure where we truly do believe we have a right to win in attractive markets with strong profitability. 
And of course, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental businesses that is fully underway and on track. We continue to be encouraged by the energy and the momentum around NewCo. As CEO Vafa Jamali, builds out his team and refines his corporate strategy, and we believe creates 2 independent and even stronger companies that is going to maximize value for not just our customers, but also for you, our shareholders. 
All right. And that brings me to the last topic that we have before we move to the Q&A, and that's going to be around innovation. And really inside of innovation, how we see our ability to drive attractive long-term growth that will ultimately deliver value to all of our stakeholders, including you, obviously, our shareholders. 
We are focused on evolving ZB from what I would define as a metal and plastic provider of implants into a leading med tech innovator. And we have a lot of shots on goal across a number of programs to do this, including a number of robotics launches over the near term, smart implants that we have today, but also the technology road map that we have in smart implants.  New functionality with mymobility and really just the broader ZBEdge ecosystem of those connected technologies that are going to help us drive mix benefit and share of wallet benefit, but also competitive conversions.
And I've mentioned before, more than 70% of our new product development investment is directed towards ZBEdge and those connected technologies inside of ZBEdge. And our exclusive partnership with Apple continues to be productive and collaborative. And we forged several other tech alliances that we know are going to drive future innovation that will benefit patients. And I believe this fundamental shift is coming for ZB and for our core markets with technology advancements, potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future, and that's really what our focus is.
So the momentum is real on the innovation front. And we think it will ultimately allow us to drive long-term growth that is very attractive to us and to you. And most importantly, it also gives ZB the chance to really change the lives of patients around the world.
All right. And let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the ZB team and our business momentum. While there continues to be uncertainty due to the global pandemic that we cannot control, I truly believe that we are ready and well positioned for success. And our strategy is absolutely working. The transformation of our business is well underway, and I'm excited about the value we can drive for our shareholders on a go-forward basis.
Now I also want to make sure that I take the time to thank the entire ZB team. Your dedication to safety is critical and your focus on delivering on our mission is unmatched and you do it daily. I remain incredibly proud of what we're accomplishing and what we're accomplishing together. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Keri for our Q&A session. Keri?"

We really do believe that those technologies, including robotics, sensors in the body, mymobility, OrthoIntel, so on and so forth, will absolutely bend the curve when it comes to growth rate in knees and hips and other areas as well because we would proliferate those beyond just knees and hips. 
So I just -- I do believe that, that technology, which is being absorbed by the folks in orthopedics right now does provide us an opportunity to enhance our growth rate as an organization for 2 reasons: one, because I do believe that we can get that share of wallet benefit or mix benefit for procedure; and two, I really do believe it sets us up to take share from the competition because it's unique to us. So yes, on the second question, I see that as being able to enhance our growth rate. 
When I think about the share, I'm pretty focused on this, as you would imagine. This is something that in a turbulent market, we got to pay attention to it. And when I think about the last 5 quarters that we've seen, we just had abnormally large spreads between the top and the bottom player in large joints. This speaks to just a very turbulent market that we're experiencing because of COVID. And inside of this, I'm ultra focused on share gains or losses because it's the very thing that would tell us whether we're performing well versus our competition because the market itself is difficult to understand. And I'm focused on this in regular times, but I'm ultra focused on it during turbulent times.
And that said, in a normal market, I try not to get too excited or depleted based on any individual quarter performance. There's just too many variables inside of an individual quarter, particularly now. But what I do is to take a look at a rolling 4 quarters, and that's the way we do it every time we see results out. When I think about the rolling 4 quarters, particularly prior to Q2, we definitely took share in our large joint market. We didn't beat every competitor every quarter, but every quarter over the 4 quarters preceding Q2, we were ahead of market in both knees and hips. And that obviously gives us confidence as we move forward. 
So I really try to look at it with the data that's provided from the major companies that is public to all of us, and I just track that over a 4-quarter rolling period to determine whether we are we're not taking share. And I do believe that even though it's been positive for us over those 5 quarters, I do believe the technology that we're launching is going to enhance that going forward."

But I guess, discrete is focused more on near-term sequential trends here. Why would Zimmer perhaps be seeing different trends versus your peers? I think you made some comments about the backlog burn being a little bit slower, et cetera. Maybe put that in perspective for us? And my second question is, your ROSA, I think one of the key advantages of the system is ease of use, the higher throughput. Given there is a backlog, are you seeing increased traction there or customers appreciating this speed advantage of ROSA? And what does that translate to a total installed base or share gains perhaps for Zimmer?"
264048,1673156913,2360841,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

And as you probably remember, we spent a lot of time thinking about the design characteristics of ROSA. It's one of the primary things we want to focus on is to make sure that we did not disrupt the surgical flow and certainly did not want to add time to the surgical procedure. And that has benefited us. There's no question. I mean, to me, it wouldn't matter whether we're in a COVID environment or a non-COVID environment. That is something that our surgeons are pursuing. And they very much appreciate the fact that it's not disrupting their flow, and it's not dramatically increasing any the times to do procedures. So that is a benefit for us for sure. 
And again, I don't think it really matters whether you're in a COVID environment or not, that's just a benefit. One of the things relative to share gains that you talked about and our view on backlog, I don't know that our outlook and what we've described is really any different than anyone else who plays in large joints like us with such a significant share position. It seems pretty consistent with -- to me anyway.
If I think about the deferred patients, I'd just say that like most people at this point, that just becomes more challenging now as time continues to be added to the equation. It's just unprecedented right now that what we're dealing with, just given how long this has gone on. And there are just too many variables in my view, just to really size this appropriately, and I think anyone would probably say this now. But that said, we still believe that there's been no structural shift in the disease state. That's what we've been saying all along. And as a result of that, there's got to be a sizable deferred patient population out there.
And when we originally analyzed what we thought would happen with that deferred population, we looked at Q3 of last year. And we assume that when -- based on what we saw in Q3, that when the vaccine was available, you would have a pretty significant return of deferred patients relatively quickly. And again, that's what we saw in parts of Q3 last year when the virus was subsiding. So we just assumed that would happen this year.
Now fast forward today, the vaccine is here, and we've got more current data and more data points that are playing out right now. And this doesn't seem to be materializing for anybody. And as such, our current thinking is that deferred patient demand will likely come at a more gradual pace and probably be more consistent over a longer-term period of time as a result. I think that's really what we're contemplating by the way, when you think about the midpoint of the revenue range that we just provided, the implied range for the back half of the year. But actually at the top of that range, as I think most people would say, we would need to see a change in the current pacing of that recovery.
So in other words, you'd have to see it reflect an increase in deferred patient demand that would also be matched by capacity increases to get to that top end of the range."

All I would say is that based on our assumption of no structural change in the disease data, it's got to be big. I'll just -- I'll leave it at that, but I don't want to try to size it.
And yes, my current thinking is based on the data points that are available to us, is that it's likely going to be a slower role with that deferred patient group coming in. And that would indicate that this should take a while for us to work through it. That could change at any time, but that's the data points that we have right now. 
Relative to iQ, I'm glad that you're hearing there's pent-up demand because certainly, we're feeling that as well, and we're getting excited about the launch, the pending launch. And we still obviously cannot market the technology because we don't have FDA approval, but we do believe that, that should be coming soon. 
And yes, we're excited about it, but you do not actually need to have the full ZBEdge infrastructure to take advantage of it. What we would like to see people do is to have my mobility and the Persona iQ combined because we believe the combination of the data collection between those 2 is extremely beneficial, but you don't really even need that. But that would be the goal for us to have that move in concert and be able to have the mymobility in concert with the iQ implant. 
And we do feel that all the components are there for remote patient monitoring. That's the whole idea behind this. Through mymobility, through iQ is to be able to remote patient monitor. And as a result of that input provided, be able to make decisions on what you do or don't want to do with the patient. And so we believe that we have what would be required for a surgeon to get a reimbursement for RPM. That's the way we're looking at it today. At the end of the day, that's not our decision on whether it happens or not, but we do believe we have the components to make that available to surgeons."

You're going to get better outcomes as a result of it. And when you have that happen, I believe more patients will enter the funnel because they're going to have higher confidence in the procedure.
Remember, there's still 20% of knee patients that are not happy with the outcome. And if we can reduce that through technology, I believe you've got patients sitting on the side that would enter the funnel, which is good for everybody, patient included. So I'm very happy to see momentum in ROSA, but I'm even happier to see technology adoption in orthopaedics overall.
And when we think about our placements, it's interesting because we focus in 2 major areas where we spend most of our time, in platinum accounts and gold accounts. And both of those would just be very large accounts. The difference between the 2 would be platinum. We have a higher share position. And in gold, we have a lower share position. But those are the 2 areas that we concentrate mostly with ZBEdge and ROSA. 
Now what's interesting about that though is even when we go into that platinum account, it's very rare that we would have a homogeneous knee usage in the account. So even when we get a platinum customer that is using us in knee, to move into ROSA, we typically get competitive conversions to ROSA because you have competitive surgeons in those accounts. And of course, in gold accounts, you get the same thing. 
So it's almost every placement that we have very rarely otherwise, provides an opportunity for us to get a competitive conversion. And hopefully, that helps with the way we're thinking about ROSA."

When we talked about gross margin for 2021, we talked about it being stable to back half of 2020, right? We said it may not be the same for each quarter because there are a lot of variables that impact gross margin. But we said broadly that it would be in line or stable. And that comes off with many years of declining gross margins. So it's a good first step in actually seeing that stability.
First half fortunately was a little bit better than the back half of last year, and so we're encouraged by that. We expect the second half of this year to be pretty much in line with the second half of last year, so very consistent with how we've previously guided. When you average those 2 together, the first half of this year being a little stronger in the second half being in line, that would suggest that the full year should be slightly better than what we saw in the back half of last year. 
So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. I do want to just thank and recognize the supply chain team as well as the commercial team for a lot of great efforts on our cost down initiatives, looking more strategically at E&O and really looking for opportunities to become more efficient in our cost of goods just overall. So seeing some good progress so far. So we're encouraged, and that's how we thought about it, and that's what's baked into our guidance moving forward."

And then again, for that to step up again sequentially in Q4, again, all versus 2019. So that's how we currently see it. And again, it's pretty much based on that continued recovery that we've already seen in Q2.

I just -- when I think about what Suky just referenced that we've got a pretty significant assumption in our guidance range that says COVID pressure doesn't get worse and the recovery builds through the second half. But we didn't just assume that. There are some proof points that we're seeing, and that might speak to your question, Larry, maybe a little more. There's really kind of 2 things that we're seeing that would give us confidence in that assumption. 
And the first one is that even with the recent virus surges that are all over the news, I mean, you can't look at the news any time during the day and not see something about the virus surge, but it doesn't seem to be translating into the same significant revenue disruption that we've seen in the past and certainly not helping us, but it's not translating into that same kind of revenue disruption we've seen in the past. So -- and I believe that's likely because we've got more vaccines out there, obviously, which is impacting the way people feel when they get sick. But also, I just think that hospitals seem to be managing this patient population better.
And the second kind of proof point for us when we thought about this as an assumption inside the guidance range, is that the vaccine is available. I mean let's face it. It's available globally anywhere. Anybody who wants it can get it. And I truly do believe even though it stalled a bit in certain parts of the world, I do believe as people get more educated on the Delta variant and the risk associated with that. That may be a good motivator for people to come in that have been waiting to actually get the vaccine. And so those are kind of the proof points that we have that give us confidence that we should see the continued recovery in the back half."

So that might help you kind of size it in your mind. But what I would tell you is that the way I think about it is, in a normal quarter, what we would typically see is better than 50% of our placements being done through a long-term contract, which is -- we actually like that because it does link us to the customer, and it usually has a competitive pull-through commitment as a result of that arrangement.
And in this quarter, we just saw that flip. The higher than 50% move to upfront purchases which is different than what we've seen in the past. What I don't know for sure is if that that's going to continue. I mean clearly, there were budgets that were available to people, they flexed those budgets that could continue. Hey, I'm happy either way we place ROSA. We're going to be very flexible with our customers as we go forward and make sure that we're there to support them. Our preference, as I've said in the past, is those long-term contracts, but I'll take an upfront sale as well.

Yes, as we noted, Asia Pacific sales were impacted in the quarter really by 2 things. One is the VBP impact that we talked about, which was essentially some distributors taking some inventory contraction ahead of VBP. And the second was we did see some surges late in the second quarter in some of our larger markets like Japan and Australia and New Zealand that also slowed some of our growth down. And that hit pretty much across both of those VBP as well as slowdowns in our recon business. But it was encouraging that despite those headwinds that we were able to manage through that and actually grow the region a little bit ahead of expectation. And we would expect that growth to continue in the back half of this year. 
Regarding China VBP, for competitive reasons, we're not going to size that. It was a contributor, but not the only contributor in that performance in Asia Pacific, as I mentioned. I think the important thing is how do we think about this going forward? We've looked at VBP and done a number of scenarios based on what we know at this time. Again, the final rules, pricing and volumes aren't expected to be issued for, let's call it, another few months, but that timing has been shifting around, so it could continue to shift.
But based on what we know today, we don't expect there to be a material impact from inventory change going forward. And that's what's represented in our guidance moving forward. But again, we're going to learn a lot more about VBP over the coming months, and we'll update you as we learn more. But again, it was great to see that Asia Pacific did grow through that. And I would say also, fundamentally within China, we're seeing very strong demand. And so obviously, that was the first market to be impacted by COVID-19, and it was the first market to recover, and we continue to see good strength and progression in that market. And as you know, we're a leader within China and expect to maintain that leadership position as we move forward."

For us, again, we did see that shift. We believe that it's mainly because people have more budget right now on the capital side. I don't see a shift in our customer base that drove it.

So we're going to continue to look at opportunities very similar to those. And the good thing is our firepower continues to build. And with the recovery of the pandemic, we're seeing our EBITDA improved significantly. We've turned the corner on the second quarter of 2020, which was a cliff for us, as you know, a trough, if you will, on EBITDA. And with a rolling 12-month EBITDA number as we sunset the second quarter of 2020, we're seeing a pretty big step up in our EBITDA number and a nice improvement in our overall leverage ratio. When you combine that with the debt paydown we've done so far, the debt paydown we're committing to in the back half of this year, and the over $1 billion on the balance sheet, we feel we're in a stronger position than we have been for the last 15 months to execute on that tuck-in M&A strategy.
And so I feel really good about where we are and how we're moving forward on that. I would also say, another big component of that is our spin transaction. We're really pleased with how the team has been progressing on that. We've made significant progress with our tax private letter ruling, great progress with our carve-out financials and our 10F, which we hope to file in the not-too-distant future. with the SEC on a private basis. Good progress from Vafa in formulating this go-forward strategy and building out his team.

What I would tell you is that that's kind of the beauty of the situation why my confidence is high that we're going to continue to see share gains as we have over the last 4 quarters spot. That's because we just have so many shots on goal. If you think about knee in particular, we already have ROSA out, and that's getting great traction. ROSA Partial was just launched.  Persona Revision has been out for a while, but the momentum is still very strong. And there is that spin-off opportunity to get the typical total knee. -- you still have mymobility driving conversions. You haven't even launched Persona iQ yet. 
So all of these give us an opportunity to create a differentiated environment for our customer and provide the opportunity for not only that share gain or mix gain, but also competitive conversions. And specifically on revision, the reason why I bring it up is typically in somebody's practice, you get about 10% of the overall revenue associated with revision, and it's more like 90% comes from your typical total knee.
And many times, we use that revision as a tip of the spear to convert a surgeon that is a competitive surgeon because they love the Revision system.  And that gets us in the house then to try to pursue that much larger portion of the business, which is your standard knee. So that's why I keep going back to that, we have significant dollars now that we're paying attention to, where we have a Revision customer that is using a competitive total knee system, and that gives us a great opportunity and kind of a hunting ground to go to, to get those conversions, but it's certainly not the only area that would give us the opportunity to take share. It's pretty much all of these."

Are there some higher volume accounts that are on vacation? Are you in bigger COVID hot spots?

And that's why I was referencing before when I look at share gain or loss, I never look at and spend too much time on a specific quarter, even when things are typical. But in these crazy times, so many things can impact your performance versus the market. So again, I try not to get too worked up about any given quarter. It could be. I mean the fact is share right now in a specific part of the country for instance, can be meaningful to whether you do better or worse than the competition because that particular state or county could be challenged by COVID more than others. 
So there's always those things that could impact a specific quarter. That's why when I look at over a 4-quarter period of time, that usually eliminates those hotspots. And that's why I feel more confident and more comfortable with more of that trend, which -- through that trend basically eliminates the noise, I'm going to put air quotes around the ""noise"" of a specific quarter. That's why I still feel confident that we're in good shape that we have all these shots on goal that we should continue to take share. But hey, I'm disappointed. I look at the quarter, I don't really care what the reason is. I want to win every single quarter and this one we didn't. But again, I'll look more at the trend and take more from that on the prediction of share taking in the future. And I would just say in a nutshell, I believe that we're going to be net share takers."

I just want to say, and I think this is probably obvious to everybody. We certainly have an outsized dependence on elective procedures versus really any of our med tech peers or competitors, particularly large cap companies. We're just an outsized impact there. And as a result, we're very sensitive to COVID ebbs and flows. And we spend a lot of time as you would imagine, analyzing this. And we try to remain prudent in our expectation setting as a result. And because we've seen it. We've seen it first hand that COVID can move our business pretty rapidly given that dependence on elective procedures. And this has been what was reflected in the updated guidance and why our implied range for the back half is still pretty wide because again, there are things that can happen here to move us up or down pretty rapidly because of that dependence on elective procedures. 
Now relative to Q2 specifically, and Suky said this before, even with some of the unexpected challenges that we had in the quarter, hey, we delivered better-than-expected results, which I think speaks to 2 very important things. Number one, and this is more short term, but it's important, the recovery from COVID is moving in the right direction. Now it's definitely not happening the way we anticipated. I don't think it is for anybody. But it's moving in the right direction, nonetheless. And the 2, and I think this is important, not just for now, but the long term, our team continues to execute and deliver against the things we can control and both of these things were deeply considered in our updated guidance. 
And this gives us confidence that continued recovery through the back half of the year is going to happen. And we see a path to end 2020 at 4% to 5% organic growth, at 4% to 5% we've been talking about without the need for any material benefit from clearing the deferred patient queue. And I got to say, given where we started just a few years ago,  and with COVID in between, with very flat to negative growth with consistent share losses as a company. I, for one, am super proud of the team for putting ZB in this position. And I look forward to not just talking about it, but delivering it for you, our customers and our patients. 
Okay. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call, and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks so much."

Let me just start with the things that I'm happy about when it comes to Q3. First of all, I'm happy on our progress with our new product introductions, they're going quite well. Our execution on recent M&A is going as planned, if not better. Our commercial focus and our discipline is as good as I've seen it. And I'm very happy with our growth versus our key competitors in both large joints and set, particularly when it comes to the U.S. 
And the team, in my view, continues to drive results in the areas under our control. And as a result, I continue to be proud of them for doing so. Alternatively, Q3 was also a quarter with unexpected negative environmental impacts that are, for the most part, out of our control. Q3 brought greater COVID pressure than I think anybody expected. 
More customer staffing shortages certainly than we expected and an earlier China VBP impact than we anticipated. And this resulted in Q3 revenues that were lower than we had projected. And unfortunately, we expect these pressure points to continue into Q4. And as a result, we need to update our 2021 financial guidance and really the view we have of the fourth quarter. 
As we look forward, until we see a fundamental shift in these trends, we're just going to assume that these pressure points aren't going away, but will be with us into Q4 and possibly into early 2022. Let's just start by taking a look at COVID and staffing concerns kind of together because I believe they're somewhat related. 
As I think most of us know by now that there was a significant delta variance surge in Q3 that drove more COVID pressure than, again, I think anybody expected. We previously thought COVID pressure would lessen through the back half of the year. But instead, while procedures did seasonally step up in September, it wasn't by as much as we expected, again, due to the enhanced COVID and staffing pressures. 
And as a result, September was our least attractive month relative to growth. And until we see a real shift in COVID and staffing-related recovery, we're projecting that the pressure we saw in September will continue through the end of the year, that's a view of COVID. If we think about China VPP, the process in China is moving forward. And although it's still fluid, we are getting more clarity on what it will mean this year and in 2022.
And our assumption going into the process was that BBP would pose no more than a 1% risk in terms of impact to ZB's overall revenue. And although for a number of reasons, the overall impact will likely be greater than what we originally anticipated. We do believe that sizing this at around 1% of revenue impact is still accurate. That is the right way to size it. 
That said, the timing of the revenue impact has definitely shifted forward, and we now expect that much of this impact will be felt in 2021. And there are a few factors that are driving this shift into 2021. First one is around current year inventory reductions by distributors. The second is around just ongoing negotiations we have with our distributor partners that are beginning to include price concessions on existing inventory. 
And then unfortunately, we're now seeing patients defer their surgeries until after the lower VBP pricing is in effect. Apparently, even though China achieves near universal public medical coverage, there are out-of-pocket expenses that increase or decrease based on implant pricing, and this is substantial enough for patients to defer their procedures. 
So clearly, in summary, although we feel very good about our execution in the areas we can control, these macro environmental issues continue to mute our overall performance, and these are fluid. These issues for sure, they're fluid, but we've done our best to incorporate our current view of their impact in our revised guidance. And I think that's a pretty good segue to move to Suky's section, where he's going to focus on Q3 financial performance, and I think very importantly, our forward-looking guidance. Okay, Suky?"

I'm going to briefly discuss our Q3 results and updates that we made to our full year 2021 financial guidance. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q3 '21 and how it compares to the same period in 2020, and my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis.
We've also provided comparisons to the third quarter of 2019 as we feel that performance to pre-pandemic results is an important comparator. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.924 billion, a reported decrease of 0.3% and a decrease of 0.8% on a constant currency basis. 
When compared to 2019, net sales increased 0.4%. On a consolidated basis, as Brian mentioned, we were growing through August, but then declined in September as we saw delta varying cases and staffing shortage increases. In short, there was a seasonal step-up in procedure volumes for the quarter, but the recovery has not taken hold as fast as we thought it would, especially in our hip and knee businesses.
The Americas declined 3.2% or flat versus 2019. The U.S. declined 4.4% or up 0.1% versus 2019. Lower U.S. performance in September was the key driver to lower consolidated results. EMEA grew 5.9% or up 0.3% versus 2019. This is the first time the region posted positive growth since the start of the pandemic. 
In the quarter, we saw an improving trend across a number of markets. However, the U.K., France, Spain and most emerging markets continue to be challenged despite higher vaccination rates. Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 0.5% or up 1.5% versus 2019. While we did see growth versus 2019, it decelerated versus what we observed in the first half of the year. This was driven in part by pricing adjustments on channel inventory as we continue to negotiate with our distributor partners ahead of VBP implementation in tandem with continuing COVID pressure throughout the region, especially in Japan and Australia and New Zealand. 
Turning to business performance in the third quarter. The global knee business declined 0.7% or down 1% versus 2019. In the U.S., needs declined 5.3% or down 0.7% versus '19. Our global hip business declined 6.6% or down 2.4% versus 2019. 
In the U.S., hips declined 11.3% or down 2.4% versus '19. The sports extremity and trauma category increased 4.2% or 7.7% versus '19, driven by continuing commercial specialization, new product introductions and the contribution from strategic acquisitions we added to this portfolio in 2020. 
Our dental and spine category declined 6.1% or down 2% versus 2019. The Dental business posted good growth in the quarter and continued to benefit from strong execution and market recovery, while the Spine business declined when compared to 2020 and 2019 due to increasing COVID pressure throughout the quarter. 
Finally, our other category grew 15.4% or down 1.1% versus 2019. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA partial knee and hip applications. 
Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69, lower than our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16 in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by cost of goods and higher spending related to litigation, our spin-off and R&D. 
In addition, our share count was up versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.81 was flat compared to the prior year, even though sales were down. 
We implemented targeted reductions in SG&A, which in tandem with a slightly lower tax rate helped offset higher investments in R&D and a higher share count. Adjusted gross margin of 70.3% was just below the prior year, and the results were slightly below our expectations due to lower volumes in tandem with less favorable product and geographic mix. 
Our adjusted operating expenses of $852 million were in line with the prior year and stepped down sequentially versus the second quarter. Inside of that, we continue to ramp up investment in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority growth areas like SET, robotics and data and informatics. And we are offsetting those increases with improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A. 
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, largely in line with the prior year and prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate of 15.8% in the quarter was in line with our expectations.
Turning to cash and liquidity. We had operating cash flows of $433 million and free cash flow totaled $307 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just over $900 million. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and pay down another $300 million of debt totaling $500 million of debt paydown for 2021 to date. 
Moving to our financial guidance. We've updated our full year 2021 outlook based on 2 factors: first, COVID and customer staffing pressures continuing at levels higher than previously expected. And while we expect procedure volumes to seasonally improve in the fourth quarter, we are taking a cautious approach and currently assuming that the more acute pressure we saw in September will continue through the fourth quarter.
And second, as Bryan mentioned, we now know more about the dynamics leading up to the implementation of the China VBP and project that it will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter than originally assumed. The impact across inventory reductions price write-downs on existing inventory and a new factor, which is patients deferring their procedures have increased the impact of VBP and the timing of that impact.
As a result, our current projection for Q4 VBP impact is about 300 basis points of hedging to our consolidated results but the situation remains fluid, and we will continue to update you as the implementation of EVP unfolds. 
For the full year, we now expect reported revenue growth to be 11.3% to 12.5% versus 2020 with an FX impact of about 140 basis points of tailwind for the year. While we are taking steps to further reduce spending in the fourth quarter as a response to our lower revenue outlook, we are reducing our adjusted operating margin projections to be 26% to 26.5% for the full year.
Our updated full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $7.32 to $7.47. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5%. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This updated full year 2021 guidance range implies that Q4 constant currency revenue growth will be between negative 2.3% and positive 1.8% versus Q4 2020.
And we project Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.90 to $2.05. We took a wider range of potential Q4 outcomes in our guidance to account for the uncertainty around COVID surges, customer staff and pressure and VBP implementation. As a note, we do believe that COVID pressure, including the related stacking shortages will continue to mute pandemic recovery as we move into 2022. 
Additionally, as we mentioned earlier, VBP is expected to reduce 2022 consolidated revenues by about 100 basis points. That impact will be felt in our large joint segment and will negatively impact gross margins as we move forward. To respond to this, we are accelerating transformation and efficiency efforts to help offset these headwinds. 
In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

And that's why I have such confidence in our long-term growth projections. The ZB team remains intensely focused on creating value and most importantly, delivering on our mission. 
Our underlying business is strong. And overall, we're pleased with our performance in large joints and set versus market. This is a significant shift for ZB versus where we were just a few years ago and an important driver of our ongoing growth. 
Our innovation is in full stride, and that's a big part of this. We're going to enter 2022 with a new product pipeline of more than 20 anticipated product launches across the next 2 years. And of course, this is incremental to a number of new products we recently launched, including, but certainly not limited to, ROSA partial knee, ROSA Hip and Persona iQ, which is the first smart knee implant in the world. We're very excited about this launch. And we continue to see strong rows of placements, increased robotic penetration into our accounts. I think most importantly, just more robotic procedures as a percentage of our overall procedure base. 
And ROSA is even more attractive because it's a key component of our ZB Edge suite of truly integrated solutions. And that really does help to tie pre, intra and post-op data together with the goal of changing patient care. And finally, we are accelerating our corporate transformation. And we're making great progress on the planned spin-off of our spine and dental business. We just recently appointed a new CFO and other key leadership team members for ZB. 
We continue to be strategic and selective in our active portfolio management process and have added key assets over the past year that have helped us to better compete and more importantly to win across robotics and data, dental, set, CMFT and the broader ASC market. We're reinvesting in our business for sure, but we're also advancing efficiency programs designed to streamline and improve how we operate and very importantly, drive savings. All of this forward momentum plus ZB's differentiated portfolio, the expected value creation of our planned spin transaction and our ability to execute really does give us continued confidence in our path to grow revenue in the mid-single digits and to deliver a 30% operating margin by the end of 2023. 
And I can tell you that this is clearly a time of significant challenge in market pressures, particularly given the fact that we have such a dependence on elective procedures. So there's no doubt about that. But this is also a time of significant opportunity for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to delivering for our team members, delivering for our shareholders and most importantly, the customers and patients that we serve. Okay.

And as we came into the third quarter, the early part of the third quarter, we actually saw some positive momentum with some modest growth in the first 2 months, but then as we came into September, we saw -- while we saw elective procedures increase in September as they generally do seasonally, that pressure from COVID and from staffing shortages was greater than expected, such that the growth wasn't there, and we just didn't get to 2019 level. 
So you really have to think about recalibrating the third quarter as then you move into the rest of the year because it was much lower than we thought. And then our original guidance suggested that Q4 would be at about market growth or were slightly better. That clearly is not what we saw in September. 
And so what we're doing is we're taking that September trend, which was down, and we're carrying that forward into the fourth quarter. So that, I would say, is the largest component of our takedown for our rest of year guidance and for Q4 specifically. In addition to that, there's been some incremental additional pressure due to VBP. 
We had always assumed that there would be some inventory dynamics that we accounted for within our forward-looking guidance range. But what we're seeing now is a slightly bigger impact primarily driven by this notion of we're seeing in market and from our local teams are telling us that patients are beginning to defer their procedures until the implementation so they can secure a lower out of pocket. 
So I won't really pull back and say that the biggest component is due to that headwind due to COVID . And instead of the fourth quarter growing as we originally thought, that pressure that we're seeing in September, we're assuming that continues for the rest of the year, and that really is our biggest deviation."

So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one by on",560,"Yes. Great question. So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one by one and help give you some additional color. First of all, like I said, about 3Q going into 4Q, as you think about '21 going to '22, you've got to recalibrate the starting point, right? 
We're going to be on a lower revenue base because of the pressure that we're projecting to see in the fourth quarter. And then from that, we would expect this COVID pressure to continue at least into the early part of '22, right? 
So revenue will be pressured, we believe in at least the early part of '22. That's one overarching assumption. And then margin largely follows revenue, especially for our company from a leverage standpoint and the ability to get profit off of our fixed cost base. 
But from there, as you move into operating margin, there's a number of moving parts. I would say, first, inside of operating margin, you have gross margin. The way I've always talked about gross margin sort of in the midterm is to take the second half of 2020 and kind of think about gross margins being stable from there. 
It could be slightly up or down in any given quarter, but largely stable to the back half of '20. We still think that, that's the right starting point. But what we have to watch out for now is the impact of VBP and what that does as a headwind. And also, what we're seeing like many of our peers in our sector, is some inflationary pressure on cost of goods and input costs and labor costs. 
So we're just going to have to watch those headwinds. Look, our teams are working really hard to help offset those. But that's still a moving target for us and something that we've got to continue to put a little bit more rigor on and obviously, we'll give more detail when we give guidance at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Then within operating margin as well, the second key component is SG&A. I'm really proud of what the team has done already this year to respond to lower revenues and lower margins because all the factors I talked about. And quite frankly, we're accelerating our transformation journey, and we're doing that in a number of ways. One, we're looking at regional profitability, and we're looking at restructuring a number of markets that are just below where our expectations would be. 
We're looking at other areas of our cost base and accelerating our global business services strategy. And there are other structural type initiatives that we're taking inside of SG&A to help some of those revenue and gross margin headwinds that I talked about. So those are some of the moving parts. 
I'm not going to get into exactly what '22 looks like yet. I think we got to let a lot more play out in the rest of this year, especially around COVID before we can give you a more detailed view of '22. But hopefully, you've gotten some good color there to help you start on 2020."

First of all, when we think about this 4% to 5% growth that we're trying to accomplish, we've been pretty clear on what we need to see to make that happen. 
First and foremost, we need to see above-market growth in our biggest franchise, which is knee. And we've been able to prove that over the past 6 quarters or so that we were able to get a trend in that direction. Second is we need to be at market growth in hip trending to above-market growth as we get ROSAtraction, which is now in the market -- new to the market, but now in the market. 
And then we needed to be in that mid-single-digit growth rate for S.E.T. if not to the upper end of that. And so those are the areas that we're really focusing on. We believe are the building blocks as we get into 2023 to give that 4% to 5% revenue growth. 
We still believe that, that is absolutely possible for this organization. So that's kind of the top line view, which would be a big component, obviously, of driving that operating margin that we're projecting in 2023 as well. So Suky, I'll pass it to you for that."

In addition, through active portfolio management, we now also have the spin, which is going to create a tailwind for us from an operating margin standpoint as well. So we feel good about that. So we still think we have all the right building blocks in place to get to that 30% operating margin run rate as we exit 2023."

What I would tell you, though, all Tunica aside, we're very excited about IQ. This is the first of its kind. It's good to bring technology to the market that literally is new to market, and that's exactly what we have. And although we're excited about IQ by itself, it's a really important variable in a much broader equation, which we call ZB Edge. Because now what we're focused on in ZB is to be able to collect data before, during and after the procedure and it's a really important reason for that because as that data lake increases, what we're going to be able to do is to predict what kind of care we should provide for the patient. Here's what I know. Every time I'm out talking to a surgeon, I don't care how good they are, what their capability is. They always have a patient or patients that look perfect, they did all the right cuts. They have -- the image looks fantastic. The tissue balancing was perfect, but that patient is not happy. And they don't know why. I don't know why. 
But as we collect this data, and again, the data lake gets larger, we're going to be able to predict why and be able to change that outcome. That's the intent here. And why that's really important is because when we can do that, you've got patients sitting on the sideline right now that would enter the funnel, but are afraid to because they don't believe they're going to get the satisfaction they're looking for. If we can change that paradigm, we can get more patients into the funnel. That's good for everybody in this space. So IQ is very attractive to us, but it's a part of a bigger equation. 
And I could tell you from IQ perspective, we're in a very limited launch. We want to learn as much as we can as fast as we can. We do have some supply constraints here, and that will put a little bit of a damper on how we're going to roll this out. Microchips are tough to come by. It's not impacting us in ROSA because you're talking hundreds. But when you move to IQ, you're talking thousands . 
And so it is going to get in the way in the short term that we -- again, we're trying to work through it, but that is going to put a damper on our launch. The demand is great. There's a lot of noise around this, and people are very interested. So that's a good sign. We've got to work through the supply constraints and move this forward. But overall, we're very happy."

So maybe I'll start with the impact. No matter what happens in this base year, we're still predicting a 1% shift to whatever revenue assumptions you had in '22, right?

So if you look at growth rate from '21 to '22, that's going to change because you're going to have more of your base. 
But the actual impact to consolidated revenues is still 1% in '22. So that's why we're looking at it. I'm going to say 1% sounds like I know exactly, just know there's still some variability here. It could be a little more could be a little less. But I think the right way to model it is 1%. Remembering, again, that even though it's 1% of consolidated revenue, it's all in large joints, okay? If I think about our share position in China, we look great. I'll just give you a fact to it. 
Just as an example. If you look at our Asia Pacific, not specifically China, but gives you some context here. If you look at our Asia Pacific knee business, revenue that we do on an annual basis, it's bigger than all 3 of our major competitors, OUS knee business. 
So that gives you some sense for our market share inside of Asia Pacific and inside of China. So this is a pretty important market for us. Here's what's great, though. When we think about share position going forward, even though it's not as an attractive market now because of the margin profile of the business in large joints, we want every one of the categories. 
There are 8 categories. Number one, it may be in an attractive space, but you still got to win. And the first step in winning is you got to be in play. And we're in play in every one of the categories. We're the only multinational company to do that. Number two now is going to be negotiating with distributors so we get the best distributors to be able to get the most share at the best margin. And that's exactly what we're focused on right now. So that gives you a sense for how we're feeling about it. 
And when I think about trauma spine, it's too early. What I'd say on trauma, there's a provincial tender that just went through its 12 provinces tender that we think we're at least hearing rumors could end up being a national tender, kind of transition to a national tender, but we don't have any sense for when that would occur. But anyway, that's our sense for China, our share position and VBP."

And our innovation pipeline is one that I'm very excited about. And at the center of that is ROSA. 
There's no question that we continue to deliver on our expectations there, if not above. And I'll just go back to the design characteristics that we put into place. We really took our time to make sure that we learned from who went first, and we designed a robotic system that surgeons really want it. 
And that's translating into demand, and that continues. The fact is surgeons don't want to change the flow of their procedure. And we have created a robotic system that keeps it as close as possible. It's a nonrobotic procedure. 
We make a time-neutral to be able to use robotics at the same amount of time it would take to do a nonrobotic procedure, including all the accuracy though, involved in it. And we made sure that we didn't change the standard of care relative to imaging. We don't have to use CT scan. People don't use it otherwise, and they can use the typical imaging that they would use for a procedure. 
All those things combined with the best implant that we have in Persona is what's driving traction right now. And we are absolutely seeing strong demand, which is continuing for us. We're seeing deeper penetration as a result of that into our accounts, in competitive accounts as well. And what's really important about that is with all these placements now in place, remember, the pull-through that you're asking about, the commitment of volume is being muted by COVID. 
So when the COVID cloud is gone, those units that we have in place will actually increase their overall input, not just in the disposable price point that you have with robotic procedures, but also the pull-through of competitive business. 
So we're very excited about where we are with ROSA. We know that we've got the right design in place and we're seeing great traction."

The second area is we looked across our organization. We looked at how we're structured relative to benchmark. And where we had outliers, where we had higher costs, we're looking to take actions to make ourselves more efficient, either through just restructuring and delayering and/or accelerating moving resources to our highly capable global business services that we have in lower-cost countries. So those are probably the key areas. I think the third structural area we're looking at is consolidate -- continued consolidation of our ERP systems, which is going to give us a better global process orientation, which could yield savings over time.

And the nice thing is we're just in the forefront of that innovation pipeline. Here's what's interesting. I think one of the most important things about that 5 quarters out of the last 6 where we've been above market in need, isn't necessarily the amount that we've been above market or just even those 6 quarters? Just looking at the trend break that you're seeing from ZB. And what do I mean by that? 
If you go beyond those 6 quarters, and you look at the 20-plus quarters that ZB has been a company, we did not have one quarter as a company above market in knees, not one quarter in more than 20 quarters. And so that is a significant reflection of the transformation taking hold. And it's a reflection of the transformation taking hold when we're at the -- just the beginning of the innovation cycle. 
We're only about a mid-single-digit vitality index right now. Our strat plan would indicate that's going to triple over this trap plan period. That's a dramatic tailwind that we expect to see in our innovation pipeline, which is a big part of why we believe this is sustainable. If you look at specifically in knees, the execution is definitely better than we've seen before. 
Our compensation structure is now focused on growth rather than just maintaining business. And our operating mechanisms are as good as I've ever seen. There's clearly no more supply issues anymore. It's all around innovation now. And innovation still drives personal revision. That is still getting conversions on the revision side. But most importantly now, it gives you a beachhead with customers that are using our revision system and somebody else's total knee, guaranteed we're going to be pursuing that total knee business, and that's bigger than the Revision business. 
You still have ROSA knee that's just getting started. We've got a lot of headroom in ROSA Knee, and that continues to pace very well. ROSA partial just launched. Remember, with partial, we have a very large share position. So even if we didn't get competitive business, which we certainly are going to try, we have a mix benefit associated with that in those partial procedures. Persona iQ, just starting, as we talked about before, and ZB is exciting. 
And then in 2022, we've got a new form factor for our Persona cementless, which is going to remove all stops for us to be able to pursue a conversion to sameness knee. So all those things just give you a lot of shots on goal to continue to drive strong performance in."

But what I'll tell you is that it's probably a bit of a conservative approach to look at September and then assume that, that's going to continue through.

Every time I try to use an external view of when COVID is going to get better, we seem to be wrong. And so I'm not going to go with that. I'm going to go with what we're actually seeing in the marketplace. And what we're seeing in the marketplace is consistency, not always the same mix of pressures between COVID and staffing but consistency in the overall pressure in October that we saw in September. 
And so I learned my lesson. I'm not going to try to predict this anymore until I actually see proof in the marketplace that we're seeing firsthand that we're bending that curve. We would expect this to continue into 2020. Your guess is as good as others have tried to predict when this is going to stop, your guess is as good as ours. We truly do believe this will float into 2020. We don't know how far, but we do believe it's going to float into 2022."

Just to build on what Brian said, I think the labor shortages is the toughest component to really try and meet, right, because it's unprecedented. And it's not just at the nurse level, it's really throughout the hospital setting. What we do know through survey data, this is not statistically relevant so please don't run too far with it. But over half of the physicians that have reported in the third quarter have stated that they've suffered from labor staff shortages. And when those particular physicians have that challenge, they're doing about 10% fewer procedures than they normally would do. So that's very real. 
And we're also seeing that, that impact is greater in the hospital setting than it is in the ASC setting. And as you know, we've got a more prominent share in the hospital setting. So I think it more disproportionately impacts us. Because of those, we're taking the approach until we see substantial durable improvement, we're going to continue to take a view that this is lingering with us. But again, hopefully, it's a conservative view, as Bryan said. 
Hopefully, it lifts sooner than we all expect. and we're better off, but that's how we're thinking about it."

The fact that we've done as much as we have with the limited firepower we do have is pretty impressive. 
I'd actually give the team high complements to be able to select targets, get creative in the way that we pay for those targets even in an environment with high multiples and bringing technologies that are absolutely fundamental to success inside of set, for instance. Our A&E acquisition helps us in our thoracic space, which is a big growth area for us that we're focused on. 
The ReLine technology that we brought in filled out significant gaps we had in sports, and that gives us the ability then to leverage that full portfolio. And even Omni suite, which is not overly exciting, when you talk about booms and lights, but it gives us a bigger presence in the ASC market. All those things happened in concert with a relationship with Canary for smart implants, long-term smart implants beyond Disney during the time that we just didn't have a lot of firepower.

But I think what you're finding is that initial wave was where backlog was being consumed at a faster pace with hip and some of that has caught up is my view on it. 
And then the knee procedures now are -- patients are ride waiting. You've got patients that have been out there for a year that are finally coming in to get a procedure. And so I truly do believe these patients have waited as long as they could from a pain threshold standpoint, but now we're entering the market where a lot of those that had significant pain with hip or trauma, we're already in the funnel.

But when we put that 30% aspiration out, there were 2 big components that we had not contemplated. One was VBP, as you just mentioned. But the other was the active portfolio management in the spin of the spine and dental business, which will be margin accretive. 
We think that those 2 largely offset one another. So again, that's another reason why we're even in the backdrop of this headwind, still confident on our ability to deliver that exit run rate at the end of 2023. 
Relative to day rate, there's no meaningful headwind tailwind relative to day rate, and that's going to be true for the full year as well. And then on the M&A contribution, I would put it in the low single digits. 
So if you think about M&A, if you looked at set by itself, which is about 20% of our overall revenue, it's in the neighborhood of about 300 bps of benefit. So probably less than 1% for the overall consolidated results. But in set, it helped by about 300 basis points."

But what I would tell you is I do believe it has been so far, anyway, more recently, a pretty good combination of those 2. 
The Delta surges are absolutely real, and that is impacting capacity in the hospitals, less so in the ASC, but definitely in the hospital. And staffing surgeons are very real. Again, as Suky referenced more in the hospital than the ASC. But both of those things are contributing. What we typically look at, though, and we still do, is to look at starts. 
When does the patient enter the funnel, and it usually takes from the time they do to the time to get a procedure 4 to 5 weeks, that seems to be extending now because you've got more people that are entering the funnel, I believe. But here's a thing. 
We're just not seeing those starts change north versus more than what seasonality would allow. And so seasonality is occurring, procedures are increasing. August or September was better procedurally speaking. We expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter, but that's being muted by these pressures associated with COVID and staffing. 
And so that's the reason why we're changing the guidance. It's not that procedures aren't increasing, they are. They're just not increasing nearly at the clip we would expect because of these pressures. I wish -- I don't have a better effort"

So that, by itself, could obviously help from an ASP standpoint despite doing better job on the pricing front, that's one area. Separate from that, a big focus for us is mix benefit. 
The fact is when we think about share of wallet in a procedure, a lot of the technologies we're launching actually do have an effect of taking up the amount of money you make per procedure. And so if I think about robotics, you've got a premium every time somebody uses a robotic procedure in that procedure. 
When you think about cementless, you get a premium, every time somebody uses it. When you think about my mobility, every time somebody uses it, you get a premium in that procedure. So we would actually expect as we get deeper penetration in these key areas of technology. Persona IQ is another one.

So again, I think it's really challenging to try to predict when staffing concerns are going to end. I think what's interesting about it is just the fact that there are staffing concerns, it's driving a whole new submarket for nurses and other folks because you can leave the hospital you're in, and you can become a traveling nurse. 
And you can get paid a lot more than you're getting paid inside of the hospital you're at. And so if you're willing to take that flexibility and you're willing to travel, you can get paid a lot more. 
So it's creating a whole new kind of submarket for nurses, which is exacerbating the problem. So I just can't predict it. I'd love to be able to for you, but I'm definitely assuming it's going to happen -- continue to happen in 2022, I just -- I can't say with any accuracy when it would stop.

That's a good question because if you think about it, as people are having to pay for traveling nurses, they're paying a lot more too, and they're trying to retain their talent in this market, which also costs more. But this is nothing new. I mean hospitals get pressured all the time in their margin, and they pressure us all the time from a pricing standpoint. 
So no matter what the pressure they're feeling, there's going to be no -- really no change associated with how much pressure they put on us for pricing. And so I don't predict any real change in our pricing dynamics as a result of this. As we said before, I actually would predict over the 5-year strat plan to reduce the pricing impact for a number of reasons. Number one, just better pricing discipline as an organization and number two, better contracting skills as we contract, particularly with the ROSA in place, and multi-category contracting, we can stabilize our pricing. 
So there's clearly going to be headwinds. And there's clearly going to be people looking for better pricing. There's no question about that. I don't believe this particular variable will change the dynamic there, though."

Thanks, Keri, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Let me just start with the things that I'm happy about when it comes to Q3. First of all, I'm happy on our progress with our new product introductions that they're going quit",711,"All right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Let me just start with the things that I'm happy about when it comes to Q3. First of all, I'm happy on our progress with our new product introductions that they're going quite well. Our execution on recent M&A is going as planned, if not better. Our commercial focus and our discipline is as good as I've seen it. And I'm very happy with our growth versus our key competitors in both large joints and set, particularly when it comes to the U.S.  
For the team, in my view, continues to drive results in the areas under our control. And as a result, I continue to be proud of them for doing so. Alternatively, Q3 was also a quarter with unexpected negative environmental impacts that are, for the most part, out of our control. Q3 brought greater COVID pressure than I think anybody expected.
More customer staffing shortages certainly than we expected and an earlier China VBP impact than we anticipated. And this resulted in Q3 revenues that were lower than we had projected. And unfortunately, we expect these pressure points to continue into Q4. And as a result, we need to update our 2021 financial guidance and really the view we have of the fourth quarter.  
As we look forward, until we see a fundamental shift in these trends, we're just going to assume that these pressure points aren't going away, but will be with us into Q4 and possibly into early 2022. Let's just start by taking a look at COVID and staffing concerns kind of together because I believe they're somewhat related.
As I think most of us know by now that there was a significant delta variance surge in Q3 that drove more COVID pressure than, again, I think anybody expected. We previously thought COVID pressure would lessen through the back half of the year, but instead, while procedures did seasonally step up in September, it wasn't by as much as we expected, again, due to the enhanced COVID and staffing pressures.
And as a result, September was our least attractive month relative to growth.   And until we see a real shift in COVID and staffing-related recovery, we're projecting that the pressure we saw in September will continue through the end of the year, that's in the view of COVID. If we think about the China VBP, the process in China is moving forward. And although it's still fluid, we are getting more clarity on what it will mean this year and in 2022.
And our assumption going into the process was that VBP would pose no more than a 1% risk in terms of impact to ZB's overall revenue. And although for a number of reasons, the overall impact will likely be greater than what we originally anticipated. We do believe that sizing this at around 1% of revenue impact is still accurate, that is the right way to size it.
With that said, the timing of the revenue impact as definitely shifted forward, and we now expect that much of this impact will be felt in 2021. And there are a few factors that are driving this shift into 2021. First one is around current year inventory reductions by distributors. The second is around just ongoing negotiations we have with our distributor partners that are beginning to include price concessions on existing inventory.
And then unfortunately, we're now seeing patients defer their surgeries until after the lower VBP pricing is in effect. Apparently, even though China achieves near universal public medical coverage, there are out-of-pocket expenses that increase or decrease based on implant pricing, and this is substantial enough for patients to defer their procedures.
So clearly, in summary, although we feel very good about our execution in the areas we can control, these macro environmental issues continue to mute our overall performance, and these are fluid. These issues for sure, they're fluid, but we've done our best to incorporate our current view of their impact in our revised guidance. And I think that's a pretty good segue to move to Suky's section, where he's going to focus on Q3 financial performance, and I think very importantly, our forward-looking guidance. Okay, Suky?"

I'm going to briefly discuss our Q3 results and updates that we made to our full year 2021 financial guidance.   Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q3 '21 and how it compares to the same period in 2020, and my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis.
We've also provided comparisons to the third quarter of 2019 as we feel that performance to pre-pandemic results is an important comparator. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.924 billion, a reported decrease of 0.3% and a decrease of 0.8% on a constant currency basis.
When compared to 2019, net sales increased 0.4%. On a consolidated basis, as Bryan mentioned, we were growing through August, but then declined in September as we saw delta variant cases and staffing shortage increases. In short, there was a seasonal step-up in procedure volumes for the quarter, but the recovery has not taken hold as fast as we thought it would, especially in our hip and knee businesses.
The Americas declined 3.2% or flat versus 2019. The U.S. declined 4.4% or up 0.1% versus 2019. Lower U.S. performance in September was the key driver to lower consolidated results. EMEA grew 5.9% or up 0.3% versus 2019. This is the first time the region posted positive growth since the start of the pandemic.
In the quarter, we saw an improving trend across a number of markets. However, the U.K., France, Spain and most emerging markets continue to be challenged despite higher vaccination rates. Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 0.5% or up 1.5% versus 2019. While we did see growth versus 2019, it decelerated versus what we observed in the first half of the year. This was driven in part by pricing adjustments on channel inventory as we continue to negotiate with our distributor partners ahead of VBP implementation. In tandem with continuing COVID pressure throughout the region, especially in Japan and Australia and New Zealand.  
Turning to business performance in the third quarter. The global knee business declined 0.7% or down 1% versus 2019. In the U.S., knee is declined 5.3% or down 0.7% versus '19. Our global hip business declined 6.6% or down 2.4% versus 2019.
In the U.S., hips declined 11.3% or down 2.4% versus '19. The sports extremity and trauma category increased 4.2% or 7.7% versus '19, driven by continuing commercial specialization, new product introductions and the contribution from strategic acquisitions we added to this portfolio in 2020.
Our dental and spine category declined 6.1% or down 2% versus 2019. The dental business posted good growth in the quarter and continued to benefit from strong execution and market recovery, while the spine business declined when compared to 2020 and 2019 due to increasing COVID pressure throughout the quarter.
Finally, our other category grew 15.4% or down 1.1% versus 2019. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA partial knee and hip applications.
Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69, lower than our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16 in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by cost of goods and higher spending related to litigation, our spin-off and R&D.
In addition, our share count was up versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.81 was flat compared to the prior year, even though sales were down.
We implemented targeted reductions in SG&A, which in tandem with a slightly lower tax rate helped offset higher investments in R&D and a higher share count. Adjusted gross margin of 70.3% was just below the prior year, and the results were slightly below our expectations due to lower volumes in tandem with less favorable product and geographic mix.
Our adjusted operating expenses of $852 million were in line with the prior year and stepped down sequentially versus the second quarter. Inside of that, we continue to ramp up investment in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority growth areas like S.E.T., robotics and data and informatics. And we are offsetting those increases with improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A.    
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, largely in line with the prior year and prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate of 15.8% in the quarter was in line with our expectations.
Turning to cash and liquidity. We had operating cash flows of $433 million and free cash flow totaled $307 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just over $900 million. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and pay down another $300 million of debt totaling $500 million of debt paydown for 2021 to date.
Moving to our financial guidance. We've updated our full year 2021 outlook based on 2 factors: first, COVID and customer staffing pressures continuing at levels higher than previously expected. And while we expect procedure volumes to seasonally improve in the fourth quarter, we are taking a cautious approach and currently assuming that the more acute pressure we saw in September will continue through the fourth quarter.
And second, as Bryan mentioned, we now know more about the dynamics leading up to the implementation of the China VBP and project that it will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter than originally assumed. The impact across inventory reductions, price write-downs on existing inventory and a new factor, which is patients deferring their procedures have increased the impact of VBP and the timing of that impact.
As a result, our current projection for Q4 VBP impact is about 300 basis points of headwind to our consolidated results, but the situation remains fluid, and we will continue to update you as the implementation of VBP unfolds.
For the full year, we now expect reported revenue growth to be 11.3% to 12.5% versus 2020 with an FX impact of about 140 basis points of tailwind for the year. While we are taking steps to further reduce spending in the fourth quarter as a response to our lower revenue outlook, we are reducing our adjusted operating margin projections to be 26% to 26.5% for the full year.
Our updated full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $7.32 to $7.47. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5%. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This updated full year 2021 guidance range implies that Q4 constant currency revenue growth will be between negative 2.3% and positive 1.8% versus Q4 2020.
And we project Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.90 to $2.05. We kept a wider range of potential Q4 outcomes in our guidance to account for the uncertainty around COVID surges, customer staffing pressure and VBP implementation. As a note, we do believe that COVID pressure, including the related staffing shortages will continue to mute pandemic recovery as we move into 2022.
Additionally, as we mentioned earlier, VBP is expected to reduce 2022 consolidated revenues by about 100 basis points. That impact will be felt in our large joint segment and will negatively impact gross margins as we move forward. To respond to this, we are accelerating transformation and efficiency efforts to help offset these headwinds.
In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan."

And that's why I have such confidence in our long-term growth projections. The ZB team remains intensely focused on creating value and most importantly, delivering on our mission.
Our underlying business is strong. And overall, we're pleased with our performance in large joints and set versus market. This is a significant shift for ZB versus where we were just a few years ago and an important driver of our ongoing growth. 
Our innovation is in full stride, and that's a big part of this. We're going to enter 2022 with a new product pipeline of more than 20 anticipated product launches across the next 2 years. And of course, this is incremental to a number of new products we recently launched, including, but certainly not limited to, ROSA partial knee, ROSA Hip and Persona IQ, which is the first smart knee implant in the world. We're very excited about this launch. And we continue to see strong ROSA placements, increased robotic penetration into our accounts. I think most importantly, just more robotic procedures as a percentage of our overall procedure base.
And ROSA is even more attractive because it's a key component of our ZBEdge suite of truly integrated solutions. And that really does help to tie pre-intra and post-op data together with the goal of changing patient care. And finally, we are accelerating our corporate transformation. We're making great progress on the planned spin-off of our spine and dental business. We just recently appointed a new CFO and other key leadership team members for [Zimby].
We continue to be strategic and selective in our active portfolio management process and have added key assets over the past year that have helped us to better compete and more importantly to win across robotics and data, dental, set, CMFT and the broader ASC market. We're reinvesting in our business for sure, but we're also advancing efficiency programs designed to streamline and improve how we operate and very importantly drive savings. All of this forward momentum plus ZB's differentiated portfolio, the expected value creation of our planned spin transaction and our ability to execute really does give us continued confidence in our path to grow revenue in the mid-single digits and to deliver a 30% operating margin by the end of 2023.
And I can tell you that this is clearly a time of significant challenge in market pressures, particularly given the fact that we have such a dependence on elective procedures. So there's no doubt about that. But this is also a time of significant opportunity for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to delivering for our team members, delivering for our shareholders and most importantly, the customers and patients that we serve.

And so just I'd love to understand specifically kind of where you see the greatest delta kind of between your previous expectations from a product segment and recovery standpoint. It sounds like VBP is maybe 3/4 of that $200 million. But outside of that, kind of where you see an impact that we should be thinking about from a guidance perspective?"

So thanks for the question, Ryan. Absolutely, our Q4 implied is lower than where we were when we last provided guidance in August and updated in September.

Absolutely, our Q4 implied is lower than where we were when we last provided guidance in August and updated in September. And if you remember, that guidance is predicated on COVID not worsening and actually starting to see things recover and improve.
And as we came into the third quarter, the early part of the third quarter, we actually saw some positive momentum with some modest growth in the first 2 months, but then as we came into September, we saw -- while we saw elective procedures increase in September as they generally do seasonally, that pressure from COVID and from staffing shortages was greater than expected, such that the growth wasn't there, and we just didn't get to 2019 level.
So you really have to think about recalibrating the third quarter as then you move into the rest of the year, because it was much lower than we thought. And then our original guidance suggested that Q4 would be at about market growth or slightly better. That clearly is not what we saw in September.
And so what we're doing is we're taking that September trend, which was down, and we're carrying that forward into the fourth quarter. So that, I would say, is the largest component of our takedown for our rest of year guidance and for Q4 specifically. In addition to that, there's been some incremental additional pressure due to VBP. 
We had always assumed that there would be some inventory dynamics that we accounted for within our forward-looking guidance range. But what we're seeing now is a slightly bigger impact primarily driven by this notion of we're seeing in market and from our local teams are telling us that patients are beginning to defer their procedures until the implementation, so they can secure a lower out of pocket.
So I won't really pull back and say that the biggest component is due to that headwind due to COVID. And instead of the fourth quarter growing as we originally thought, that pressure that we're seeing in September, we're assuming that continues for the rest of the year, and that really is our biggest deviation."

So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one by on",561,"Yes. Great question. So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one by one and help give you some additional color. First of all, like I said, about 3Q going into 4Q, as you think about '21 going to '22, you've got to recalibrate the starting point, right?
We're going to be on a lower revenue base because of the pressure that we're projecting to see in the fourth quarter. And then from that, we would expect this COVID pressure to continue at least until the early part of '22, right?
So revenue will be pressured, we believe in there at least the early part of '22. That's one overarching assumption. And then margin largely follows revenue, especially for our company from a leverage standpoint and the ability to get profit off of our fixed cost base.
But from there, as you move into operating margin, there's a number of moving parts. I would say, first, inside of operating margin, you have gross margin. The way I've always talked about gross margin sort of in the midterm is to take the second half of 2020 and kind of think about gross margins being stable from there.
It could be slightly up or down in any given quarter, but largely stable to the back half of '20. We still think that, that's the right starting point. But what we have to watch out for now is the impact of VBP and what that does as a headwind. And also, what we're seeing like many of our peers in our sector, is some inflationary pressure on cost of goods and input costs and labor costs.
So we're just going to have to watch those headwinds. Look, our teams are working really hard to help offset those. But that's still a moving target for us and something that we've got to continue to put a little bit more rigor on, and obviously, we'll give more detail when we give guidance at the end of the fourth quarter.
Then within operating margin as well, the second key component is SG&A. I'm really proud of what the team has done already this year to respond to lower revenues and lower margins, because all the factors I talked about. And quite frankly, we're accelerating our transformation journey and we're doing that in a number of ways. One, we're looking at regional profitability, and we're looking at restructuring a number of markets that are just below where our expectations would be.
We're looking at other areas of our cost base and accelerating our global business services strategy. And there are other structural type initiatives that we're taking inside of SG&A to help some of those revenue and gross margin headwinds that I talked about. So those are some of the moving parts.
I'm not going to get into exactly what '22 looks like yet. I think we got to let a lot more play out in the rest of this year, especially around COVID before we can give you a more detailed view of '22. But hopefully, you've gotten some good color there to help you start on '22."

So maybe what I'll do is I'll start off with the components that we've defined as what we need to see for growth rates, and then you can take it from there on the op margin piece. First of all, when we think about this 4% to 5% growth that we're trying to accomplish, we've been pretty clear on what we need to see to make that happen.
First and foremost, we need to see above-market growth in our biggest franchise, which is knee. And we've been able to prove that over the past 6 quarters or so that we were able to get a trend in that direction. Second is we need to be at market growth in hip trending to above-market growth as we get ROSA traction, which is now in the market -- new to the market, but now in the market.
And then we needed to be in that mid-single-digit growth rate for S.E.T. if not to the upper end of that. And so those are the areas that we're really focusing on. We believe are the building blocks as we get into 2023 to give that 4% to 5% revenue growth.
We still believe that, that is absolutely possible for this organization. So that's kind of the top line view, which should be a big component, obviously, of driving that operating margin that we're projecting in 2023 as well. So Suky, I'll pass it to you for that."

We talked about gross margins being stable. I've talked about some headwinds that we're going to look to offset over time and then SG&A becoming a lot more efficient and the ability to reinvest that back against that higher growth, which gives us that leverage to 30% operating margin.
In addition, through active portfolio management, we now also have the spin, which is going to create a tailwind for us from an operating margin standpoint as well. So we feel good about that. So we still think we have all the right building blocks in place to get to that 30% operating margin run rate as we exit 2023."

What I would tell you, though, all -- IQ side, we're very excited about IQ. This is the first of its kind. It's good to bring technology to the market that literally is new to market, and that's exactly what we have. And although we're excited about IQ by itself, it's a really important variable in a much broader equation, which we call ZBEdge. Because now what we're focused on ZBEdge is to be able to collect data before, during and after the procedure, and it's a really important reason for that because as that data lake increases, what we're going to be able to do is to predict what kind of care we should provide for the patient. Here's what I know. Every time I'm out talking to a surgeon, I don't care how good they are, what their capability is. They always have a patient or patients that look perfect, they did all the right cuts. They have -- the image looks fantastic. The tissue balancing was perfect, but that patient is not happy. And they don't know why. I don't know why. 
But as we collect this data, and again, the data lake gets larger, we're going to be able to predict why and be able to change that outcome. That's the intent here. And why that's really important is because when we can do that, you've got patients sitting on the sideline right now that would enter the funnel, but are afraid to because they don't believe they're going to get the satisfaction they're looking for. If we can change that paradigm, we can get more patients into the funnel. That's good for everybody in this space. So IQ is very attractive to us, but it's a part of a bigger equation.
And I could tell you from IQ perspective, we're in a very limited launch. We want to learn as much as we can as fast as we can. We do have some supply constraints here, and that will put a little bit of a damper on how we're going to roll this out. Microchips are tough to come by. It's not impacting us in ROSA because you're talking hundreds. But when you move to IQ, you're talking thousands.
And so it is going to get in the way in the short term that we -- again, we're trying to work through it, but that is going to put a damper on our launch. The demand is great. There's a lot of noise around this, and people are very interested. So that's a good sign. We've got to work through the supply constraints and move this forward. But overall, we're very happy."

So maybe I'll start with the impact. No matter what happens in this base year, but we're still predicting a 1% shift to whatever revenue assumptions you had in '22, right?

So if you look at growth rate from '21 to '22, that's going to change because you're going to have more of your base.
But the actual impact to consolidated revenues is still 1% in '22. So that's why we're looking at it. I'm going to say 1% sounds like I know exactly, just know there's still some variability here. It could be a little more could be a little less. But I think the right way to model it is 1%. Remembering, again, that even though it's 1% of consolidated revenue, it's all in large joints, okay? If I think about our share position in China, we look great. I'll just give you a fact to it. 
Just as an example. If you look at our Asia Pacific, not specifically China, but gives you some context here. If you look at our Asia Pacific knee business, revenue that we do on an annual basis, it's bigger than all 3 of our major competitors, OUS knee business.
So that gives you some sense for our market share inside of Asia Pacific and inside of China. So this is a pretty important market for us. Here's what's great, though. When we think about share position going forward, even though it's not as an attractive market now because of the margin profile of the business in large joints, we want every one of the categories.
There are 8 categories. Number one, it may be a non-attractive space, but you still got to win. And the first step in winning is you got to be in play. And we're in play in every one of the categories. We're the only multinational company to do that. Number two now is going to be negotiating with distributors so we get the best distributors to be able to get the most share at the best margin. And that's exactly what we're focused on right now. So that gives you a sense for how we're feeling about it.
And when I think about trauma spine, it's too early. What I'd say on trauma, there's a provincial tender that just went through its 12 provinces tender that we think, we're at least hearing rumors could end up being a national tender, kind of transition to a national tender, but we don't have any sense for when that would occur. But anyway, that's our sense for China, our share position and VBP."

It's because the market dynamics are very different.
That's why I continuously look at trends. Even in these turbulent times, the trend typically tells the story because it neutralizes some of that variation.

And our innovation pipeline is one that I'm very excited about. And at the center of that is ROSA.
There's no question that we continue to deliver on our expectations there, if not above. And I'll just go back to the design characteristics that we put into place. We really took our time to make sure that we learned from who went first, and we designed a robotic system that surgeons really want it.
And that's translating into demand, and that continues. The fact is surgeons don't want to change the flow of their procedure. And we have created a robotic system that keeps it as close as possible, it's a nonrobotic procedure. 
We make a time-neutral to be able to use robotics at the same amount of time it would take to do a nonrobotic procedure, including all the accuracy though, involved in it. And we made sure that we didn't change the standard of care relative to imaging. We don't have to use CT scan. People don't use it otherwise, and they can use the typical imaging that they would use for a procedure.
All those things combined with the best implant that we have in Persona is what's driving traction right now. And we are absolutely seeing strong demand, which is continuing for us. We're seeing deeper penetration as a result of that into our accounts, in competitive accounts as well. And what's really important about that is with all these placements now in place, remember, the pull-through that you're asking about, the commitment of volume is being muted by COVID.
So when the COVID cloud is gone, those units that we have in place will actually increase their overall input, not just in the disposable price point that you have with robotic procedures, but also the pull-through of competitive business.
So we're very excited about where we are with ROSA. We know that we've got the right design in place and we're seeing great traction."

So I would say that's one.
The second area is we looked across our organization. We looked at how we're structured relative to benchmark. And where we had outliers, where we had higher costs, we're looking to take actions to make ourselves more efficient, either through just restructuring and delayering and/or accelerating moving resources through highly capable global business services that we have in lower-cost countries. So those are probably the 2 key areas. I think the third structural area we're looking at is consolidate -- continued consolidation of our ERP systems, which is going to give us a better global process orientation, which could yield savings over time.
And then, of course, we're always actively looking at site rationalization with the help of gross margin. And I'm really excited about where the team is moving with pricing improvements going forward. So again, we're going to provide more detail as those become more refined, both on the contribution, but also the relative cost to those when we give our fourth quarter earnings."

And the nice thing is we're just in the forefront of that innovation pipeline. Here's what's interesting. I think one of the most important things about that 5 quarters out of the last 6 where we've been above market in need, isn't necessarily the amount that we've been above market or just even those 6 quarters? Just looking at the trend break that you're seeing from ZB. And what do I mean by that? 
If you go beyond those 6 quarters, and you look at the 20-plus quarters that ZB has been a company, we did not have one quarter as a company above market in knees, not one quarter in more than 20 quarters. And so that is a significant reflection of the transformation taking hold. And it's a reflection of the transformation taking hold when we're at the -- just the beginning of the innovation cycle.
We're only about a mid-single-digit vitality index right now. Our strat plan would indicate that's going to triple over this strat plan period. That's a dramatic tailwind that we expect to see in our innovation pipeline, which is a big part of why we believe this is sustainable. If you look at specifically in knees, the execution is definitely better than we've seen before.
Our compensation structure is now focused on growth rather than just maintaining business. And our operating mechanisms are as good as I've ever seen. There's clearly no more supply issues anymore. It's all around innovation now. And innovation still drives in Persona revision. That is still getting conversions on the revision side. But most importantly now, it gives you a beachhead with customers that are using our revision system and somebody else's total knee, guaranteed we're going to be pursuing that total knee business, and that's bigger than the Revision business. 
You still have ROSA knee that's just getting started. We've got a lot of headroom in ROSA Knee, and that continues to pace very well. ROSA partial just launched. Remember, with partial, we have a very large share position. So even if we didn't get competitive business, which we certainly are going to try, we have a mix benefit associated with that in those partial procedures. Persona IQ, just starting, as we talked about before and ZB is exciting. 
And then in 2022, we've got a new form factor for our Persona cementless, which is going to remove all stops for us to be able to pursue a conversion to cementless knee. So all of those things just give you a lot of shots on goal to continue to drive strong performance in knee."

But what I'll tell you is that it's probably a bit of a conservative approach to look at September and then assume that, that's going to continue through.

Every time I try to use an external view of when COVID is going to get better, we seem to be wrong. And so I'm not going to go with that. I'm going to go with what we're actually seeing in the marketplace. And what we're seeing in the marketplace is consistency, not always the same mix of pressures between COVID and staffing but consistency in the overall pressure in October that we saw in September.
And so I learned my lesson. I'm not going to try to predict this anymore until I actually see proof in the marketplace that we're seeing for a stand that we're bending that curve. We would expect this to continue into 2020. Your guess is as good as others have tried to predict when this is going to stop, your guess is as good as ours. We truly do believe this will float into 2020. We don't know how far, but we do believe it's going to float into 2022."

Just to build on what Brian said, I think the labor shortages is the toughest component to really try and meet, right, because it's unprecedented. And it's not just at the nurse level, it's really throughout the hospital setting. What we do know through survey data, this is not statistically relevant, so please don't run too far with it. But over half of the physicians that have reported in the third quarter have stated that they've suffered from labor staff shortages. And when those particular physicians have that challenge, they're doing about 10% fewer procedures than they normally would do, so that's very real. 
And we're also seeing that, that impact is greater in the hospital setting than it is in the ASC setting. And as you know, we've got a more prominent share in the hospital setting. So I think it more disproportionately impacts us. Because of those, we're taking the approach until we see substantial durable improvement, we're going to continue to take a view that this is lingering with us. But again, hopefully, it's a conservative view, as Bryan said.
Hopefully, it lifts sooner than we all expect. and we're better off, but that's how we're thinking about it."

I'd actually give the team high complements to be able to select targets, get creative in the way that we pay for those targets even in an environment with high multiples and bringing technologies that are absolutely fundamental to success inside of set for instance. Our A&E acquisition helps us in our thoracic space, which is a big growth area for us that we're focused on. 
The relying technology that we brought in filled out significant gaps we had in sports, and that gives us the ability then to leverage that full portfolio. And even Omni suite, which is not overly exciting, when you talk about booms and lights, but it gives us a bigger presence in the ASC market. All those things happened in concert with a relationship with Canary for smart implants, long-term smart implants beyond just knee during the time that we just didn't have a lot of firepower.

But I think what you're finding is that initial wave was where backlog was being consumed at a faster pace with hip and some of that has caught up is my view on it. 
And then the knee procedures now are -- patients are really been waiting. You've got patients that have been out there for a year that are finally coming in to get a procedure. And so I truly do believe these patients have waited as long as they could from a pain threshold standpoint, but now we're entering the market where a lot of those that had significant pain with hip or trauma, we're already in the funnel.

But when we put that 30% aspiration out, there were 2 big components that we had not contemplated. One was VBP, as you just mentioned.

We think that those 2 largely offset one another. So again, that's another reason why we're even in the backdrop of this headwind, still confident on our ability to deliver that exit run rate at the end of 2023.
Relative to day rate, there's no meaningful headwind/tailwind relative to day rate, and that's going to be true for the full year as well. And then on the M&A contribution, I would put it in the low single digits.
So if you think about M&A, if you looked at set by itself, which is about 20% of our overall revenue, it's in the neighborhood of about 300 bps of benefit. So probably less than 1% for the overall consolidated results. But in set, it helped by about 300 basis points."

But what I would tell you is I do believe it has been so far, anyway, more recently, a pretty good combination of those 2.
The delta surges are absolutely real, and that is impacting capacity in the hospitals, less so in the ASC, but definitely in the hospital. And staffing surgeons are very real. Again, as Suky referenced more in the hospital than the ASC. But both of those things are contributing. What we typically look at, though, and we still do, is to look at starts.
When does the patient enter the funnel, and it usually takes from the time they do to the time to get a procedure 4 to 5 weeks, that seems to be extending now because you've got more people that are entering the funnel, I believe. But here's a thing.
We're just not seeing those starts changed north versus more than what seasonality would allow. And so seasonality is occurring, procedures are increasing. August or September was better procedurally speaking. We expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter, but that's being muted by these pressures associated with COVID and staffing.
And so that's the reason why we're changing the guidance. It's not that procedures aren't increasing, they are. They're just not increasing nearly at the clip we would expect because of these pressures. I wish -- I don't have a better it force it."

So that, by itself, could obviously help from an ASP standpoint despite doing better job on the pricing front, that's one area. Separate from that, a big focus for us is mix benefit. 
The fact is when we think about share of wallet in a procedure, a lot of the technologies we're launching actually do have an effect of taking up the amount of money you make per procedure. And so if I think about robotics, you've got a premium every time somebody uses a robotic procedure in that procedure. 
When you think about cementless, you get a premium, every time somebody uses it. When you think about Mymobility, every time somebody uses it, you get a premium in that procedure. So we would actually expect as we get deeper penetration in these key areas of technology. Persona IQ is another one.

That's a good question because if you think about it, as people are having to pay for traveling nurses, they're paying a lot more too, and they're trying to retain their talent in this market, which also costs more. But this is nothing new. I mean hospitals get pressured all the time in their margin, and they pressure us all the time from a pricing standpoint. 
So no matter what the pressure they're feeling, there's going to be no -- really no change associated with how much pressure they put on us for pricing. And so I don't predict any real change in our pricing dynamics as a result of this. As we said before, I actually would predict over the 5-year strat plan to reduce the pricing impact for a number of reasons. Number one, just better pricing discipline as an organization and number two, better contracting skills as we contract, particularly with the ROSA in place, and multi-category contracting, we can stabilize our pricing.
So there's clearly going to be headwinds. And there's clearly going to be people looking for better pricing. There's no question about that. I don't believe this particular variable will change the dynamic there, though."
