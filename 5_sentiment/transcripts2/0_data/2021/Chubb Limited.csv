As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong finish to the year with excellent financial results headlined by rapid premium revenue growth and underwriting margin improvement across our commercial lines portfolio in both the U.S. and in",1798,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong finish to the year with excellent financial results headlined by rapid premium revenue growth and underwriting margin improvement across our commercial lines portfolio in both the U.S. and internationally, a trend we are confident will continue. We produced very good earnings, and our balance sheet is in excellent shape. Our fourth quarter results were in context of the historic and unprecedented time we live in nationally and globally. 
We continue to face the health, economic, political and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, which might now be more accurately viewed as an endemic on which despite the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics, will likely be with us for years to come. 
Before I go further with the quarter, I want to make a few comments about recent events and [indiscernible]. We all witnessed the shocking display of  demagoguery and insurrection by a group of our own citizens in our nation's capital in early January. We witnessed a scene in our capital building never before viewed in our country's 200-year history, including a totally unacceptable display of symbols of hate, bigotry, violence and anti semitism in the halls of Congress. 
The incident has left our country shaken and our international image tarnished. Some members of Congress attempting to subvert the will of the people. And stand in the way of what is largely a ceremonial affirmation of the electoral college vote was also unacceptable. At the end of the day, the facts are the facts. All of the independent institutions, we charge with overseeing our election process, including the Department of Justice, the new Federal Cyber Watch Dog Agency, stayed in federal Courts and state Election Officials investigated, opined and confirmed there was no widespread election fraud. Just because you don't like the political outcome, doesn't give you the right to make up your own facts or attempt to subvert our democracy in the rule of law.  This isn't going away, and there's a wake-up call to all of us who care about and love our country. 
Now returning to our fourth quarter results. We recorded core operating income of $3.18 per share, up nearly 40% from prior year, and net income of $2.4 billion or $5.34 per share, up over 100%, and which, by the way, was a record. We produced strong premium revenue growth in the quarter, with global P&C net premiums written which exclude agriculture, up 6%. Our P&C combined ratio of 87.6%, along with very good net earned premium growth produced P&C underwriting income of $969 million, up 82%. While our current accident year underwriting results, excluding cats, were even better, supported by continued underwriting margin improvement and excellent revenue growth in our Commercial P&C businesses globally as we continue to capitalize on more favorable underwriting conditions. 
The current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, was 86.4% compared to 90% prior year. The 3.6 point -- percentage points of improvement included 2.8 points of loss ratio related to improvement, which was broad-based, and let me give you a better sense of this. Agriculture improved 27 points. And then excluding agriculture, the Global P&C commercial lines loss ratio improved about 1.5 percentage points, virtually all as a result of earned rate exceeding loss cost trend. The loss ratio for Global P&C consumer lines, which is Global A&H and Global Personal lines improved 1.2 percentage points. The vast majority of which was indirect COVID benefit related.  Phil will discuss the expense ratio improvement in the quarter. 
To very briefly recap the year, though we had an entire quarter of earnings lost to our effort to reserve COVID to ultimate and a very active year of natural catastrophes, we produced $3.3 billion of core operating earnings. The full year published P&C combined ratio was 96.1% compared to 90.6% in '19. The full year P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, was 86.7% compared to 89.2%, which speaks to our underlying health.  And Our full year premium revenue growth is about 5.5% in constant dollar, with commercial lines growth of 9.3%. 
I mentioned in the beginning, a strong balance sheet. The strength of our loss reserves, which is the most important part of the balance sheet, improve throughout the year. Consistent with our practices, we continue to recognize bad news early and any potential good news late. On the one hand, there have been no changes to our P&C COVID-19 incurred loss charge, which we consider adequate to absorb COVID losses that may emerge. The vast majority of the charge remains IBNR. 
On the other hand, we have recognized only a modest degree, the reduction in losses mostly frequency due to the economic shutdowns. Beyond COVID related, we have also purposely strengthened reserves. Increasing the strength of our reserves is the prudent thing to do given the uncertainty in the environment. Book and tangible book value per share were up 7.7% and 12.2%, respectively, for the year.  Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period development. 
Turning to growth and the rate environment. As I said, Global P&C premium revenue in the quarter which excludes agriculture, grew 6%, comprising 11.3% growth in Commercial P&C and 3.9% decline in consumer lines. The consumer lines result included negative growth in Global A&H and international personal lines and positive growth in North America personal lines. In the quarter, we continue to experience a strong and continuously improving Commercial P&C pricing environment globally. 
In fact, the level of rate and rate of increase was the strongest. So this part of the underwriting cycle began approximately 3 years ago. I expect the favorable underwriting conditions to continue. In North America Commercial P&C, net premiums grew 10%. And that actually includes a reduction in growth of 3 points due to reduced exposures from the decline in economic activity. New business was up nearly 12%, and renewal retention remains strong at over 95% on a premium basis. 
In our North America Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew over 11.5%, while our middle market and small commercial business grew nearly 8%. Overall rates increased in North America Commercial P&C by 16.5%, with a loss cost trend of approximately 5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business. Let me give you a better sense of the rate movement. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty, up 7%, while general casualty rates were up over 36% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up over 30% and financial lines rates were up over 26%. 
In our E&S wholesale business, the Westchester, property rates were up over 23%. Casualty rates were up nearly 29% and financial lines rates were up over 26%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up over 15%. casualty rates were up nearly 12%, excluding workers' comp, with workers' comp rates up about 0.5%. and financial lines rates were up over 20%. In our International General insurance operations. Commercial P&C net written premiums grew 14% in the quarter. Our international retail commercial business grew 9%, and our London wholesale business grew over 32%. 
Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region. With net written premiums up 17.5% in the U.K., about 16.5% in the continent and over 16% in Asia Pacific, while Latin America shrank 14%. And as a combination of insurance market and economic conditions weigh on Latin America. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate-to-exposure across our commercial portfolio. And overseas churn rates were up 18.5% overall, with a loss cost trend of 3%. Rates were up 17% in international and retail and 26% in London wholesale. 
Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter, continues to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. Our International Personal Lines business and our Global A&H business together shrank 8%. We expect growth to return and to begin to return in these businesses as the year goes along. Our North America high net worth personal lines business, what we call personal risk services, however, remains an exception, with net premiums up 2.5% in the quarter. We continue to experience flight safety and quality in our high net worth segment. New business was up 6.5% and retention remained strong at about 92.3%, while we continue to achieve rate increases of 4.5%. 
Our Global Re business grew its net premiums written about 14.5%. And lastly, in our Asia focused international life insurance business net written premiums were up 25% in the quarter. In sum, we are in a continuing hard or firming market for Commercial P&C in most all parts of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is a rational and necessary response to years of underpricing of risk and a more uncertain risk environment today. Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. Some lines are there, while others have a way to go. Virtually all of our Commercial P&C lines of business throughout the year have been achieving rates that exceed loss cost, and so margins continue to improve. 
Looking forward, we are off to a very good start to the year in the first quarter. Both growth and the level of rate increase we are achieving look a lot like the fourth quarter. Based on everything we see, the current commercial market condition has legs. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. By almost any measure, our company performed admirably and distinguished itself during the past year. And I applaud, and I'm so grateful to our more than 31,000 Chubb colleagues around the globe, whose resilience, determination and dedication have produced distinguishing results for our clients and shareholders in spite of work from home conditions.  I also want to recognize our global management team. Who lead and reinforce our culture and discipline, a wellhead of our performance every single day. 
In closing, our company finished the year with a strong performance and momentum that continues. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are, in fact, growing exposure. Our people are energized, and we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably and increase shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then we're going to come back and take your questions."

We completed an eventful year with solid financial results and continued to build on our balance sheet strength, including substantial capital of almost $75 billion, supported by extraordinary Fed actions, our double AA rated portfolio of",775,"Thank you, Evan. We completed an eventful year with solid financial results and continued to build on our balance sheet strength, including substantial capital of almost $75 billion, supported by extraordinary Fed actions, our double AA rated portfolio of cash and invested assets grew almost $10 billion for the year and now exceeds $120 billion. Our excellent underlying underwriting and investment performance produced very strong operating cash flow of $2.5 billion for the quarter and a record $9.8 billion for the year. 
Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $542 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $190 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders or 58% of earnings, including $1.4 billion in dividends and $516 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $924 million and $3.6 billion for the year. Investment income in the quarter was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities and greater private equity distributions. 
While there were a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we now expect a quarterly run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million. Separately, our policy has always been to record the change in the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses. Instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark, if included in investment income, who have increased adjusted net investment income by $485 million for the quarter and $714 million for the year. 
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 10.7% and 17.1%, respectively for the quarter. If we had included the fair value mark on our private equity portfolio and our core operating income, core operating ROE would have been higher by 3.5 percentage points for the quarter. 
During the past few quarters, since S&P Global Ratings published a ratings update on Chubb, management has had discussions with S&P regarding Chubb's track record of strong and diverse underwriting results and operating performance. This has resulted in the company updating its capital management policy to calibrate its estimate of capital adequacy from S&P's AAA level to S&P's AA level. We believe this is sufficient to maintain our AA rating. Our capital management policy remains consistent. We hold surplus capital for both risk and opportunity. Our undeployed capital on a run rate basis, dilutes our core operating ROE by around 200 basis points. 
We are also announcing today that our Board has increased the authorization to repurchase shares by $1 billion. Our total repurchase program now allows for up to $2.5 billion between January 1 and December 31, 2021. Both intangible book value increased 5.4% and 8%, respectively, for the quarter, and 7.4% and 11.9%, respectively, for the year. Book and tangible book value were favorably impacted by after-tax net realized and unrealized gains of $2 billion for the quarter and $2.5 billion for the year. The gains were principally in our investment portfolio, primarily from the narrowing of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio, a decline in interest rates and the fair value mark on private equities. 
At December 31, our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $4.7 billion after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $314 million pretax or $271 million after tax. The P&C catastrophe losses of $296 million were primarily from a series of severe weather-related events globally. There were no changes to the previously reported estimate of our P&C COVID impaired loss charge from June 30. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $206 million pretax or $189 million after tax. This included $94 million pretax adverse development from our legacy runoff exposures, principally related to asbestos. 
The remaining favorable development of $300 million is split 70% from long tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior and 30% from short-tail lines. For the year, our net loss reserves increased $4.3 billion in constant dollars, and our paid to incurred ratio was 80%. The P&C expense ratio was 28% in the quarter with a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year. About half of the improvement is from the health-related shutdown and the balance is principally from operating efficiencies. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.2% for the quarter and 15.8% for the year.  For 2021, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. 
I'll turn the call back to Karen."

And we've stood out and given -- and therefore, garnered a lot more credibility and confidence from our clients. Chubb has been consistent in its approach about underwriting and its need for rate throughout the years. Particularly when we were shrinking and know when we couldn't achieve what we required to earn an adequate return. 
And at the same time, given the rate environment changing, our appetite consistent. We continue to promote. And on the same basis, our appetite for the amount of risk we'll take the classes of business that we will serve, where we will serve them. All of that is a well-understood story about us. And finally, what I'd say is we don't serve them in 1 line of business. Or 2 lines of business, we serve them broadly across virtually all of their needs. And the secret, we do it on a local basis. It isn't simply that we operate from 2 or 3 hubs, we're where they do business and where they need to work with us and see us every single day.

I guess my question is, if I look at the current accident year loss ratio x cat, about 120 basis points improvement year-over-year that compares to an average rate, I think that you guys have said over the last 5 quarters, it's been well above 10%, I think closer to 13%. So it sounds like it's -- I would say, maybe 8 points above trend roughly. I guess I'm wondering what are the moving pieces here I'm thinking maybe mix shifts, that would explain why we're not seeing more of that rate above trend come through in the loss ratio."

I also broke down this quarter's loss ratio margin improvement. And as you heard, there was a greater percentage of improvement for Commercial P&C than there was for consumer lines within Global P&C. And so you are seeing margin improvement. On the other hand, we are striving and will achieve an adequate risk-adjusted return, which does that we're pegging ourselves to achieve a result like that. We raised the bar in a market like this, where we're growing exposure, and there is more loss cost certainty as we look forward, COVID and non-COVID related, we are properly building reserve margin and at the same time, through growth and margin improvement and not a small amount. And a current accident year combined ratio that is world-class. We are delivering tremendous earnings at the same time we're building balance sheet strength, absolutely the right thing to do. 
And I hope that answers your question.  And finally, don't be overly simplistic about it and you weren't. You got an average loss cost trend. That varies by category of business and line of business. And we are also growing in areas that is, to some degree, changing our mix right now. Something else, I'm -- that's proprietary, I'm not going to go into.

It's not -- so it's not simply economic. It's the shutdown and travel. And imagine -- let's take it for a couple of hands. You would think of travel as simply, okay, retail travel insurance that you sell-through travel agents, et cetera, or airlines. That's actually a small part of it. Employers and employer purchased insurance where it's really -- it's purchased not for employees sitting in the office. It's purchased because they have employees traveling all the time, travel accident insurance, as an example. With travel down and then on top of it, economic -- the economic headwinds, that impacts overall A&H, a major part of A&H around the globe, whether it's in the United States, Europe, Asia or Latin America. 
Credit related, we have a huge direct marketing book of business, and it is principally Asia and Latin America. And with people taking less credit on one hand. And secondly, not just tied to credit, but marketing to their customer bases, the middle-income customer for supplemental insurances, A&H, modest homeowners and householders related. I think on the credit side as well, mortgages with economic activity down, that business slows down substantially. 
We are seeing signs of it, and it is beginning to pick back up, but it has a ways to grow in Asia, in particular, and believe it or not, in parts of Latin America, like Chile, and to some degree in places like Brazil.

Beyond that, the cyber itself is in a state of change. And the product is evolving and will evolve. It's a lot beyond pricing. Pricing is the easy part of it. It's -- that the loss environment, which I've been speaking about for numerous quarters consistently is changing. And so I'll just remind everyone, frequency of loss has been increasing as the world has digitized, and we gave it a huge shove during COVID and work remotely conditions, the world is more cyber and digitally integrated. And that raises both exposure in terms of frequency of loss, but it also raises and continues to raise the catastrophe nature of the product because of the interconnectedness of everyone globally, I have said for a number of quarters that the next pandemic, the exposure that looks like a virus is cyber related because it has no geographic or time-bound to it. We've seen a number of events over the recent years that give a glimmer of that. So it is complicated. 
And the product has to evolve to recognize that kind of exposure, both on the frequency side and the severity side. And we have a fabulous team of cyber experts who've been doing this for quite a while, you got at the same time, be humble and know what you don't know and not over imagine, there's a lot of basis risk in it, even the cyber -- all the cyber experts are constantly surprised with new day 0 events and techniques that emerge.

All of that goes, and I was pretty clear that the level of rate increase we're getting varies by the market area. And then beyond that, it varies by product area, and I gave you some sense of that. We have years and years of data. And it's not just data. It's been turned into information, and it has taken us a long time to do that and to do it properly, and so the management information flow here is so well connected between the reserving process and the rate making process in a granular, real-time way and updated based on loss and loss cost trends and actual in virtually real time, without a lot of lag. 
And it is something that all of us at all levels have great transparency and availability to access and that links back with then how we look at what business are we quoting. What business are we binding and at what terms and conditions? It doesn't mean that it's all perfect and we don't make mistakes. And given loss cost and real-world about the loss environment that we don't get surprised on the margin because things change swiftly here or there, of course. But we react quickly and finally, what I'd say to you is it's no different than this conversation that goes on about, well, how come you haven't produced more margin. Well, we're producing outstanding margin and margin improvement. Its that -- look at our reserving policy. It's that we recognize bad news close immediately. And we recognize good news over time. 
The Commercial P&C business, particularly the casualty areas are not for optimists, and I've said this many times, and by the way, the notion of prior period reserve development. Well, that's a strength. And that's part of being prudent on recognizing slowly when you're conservative and cautious about a loss cost environment. So it's the data, it's the technology, it's the knowledge of the people, and it's the management policies and practices consistently that make the difference."

As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong finish to the year with excellent financial results headlined by rapid premium revenue growth and underwriting margin improvement across our commercial lines portfolio in both the U.S. and in",1796,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong finish to the year with excellent financial results headlined by rapid premium revenue growth and underwriting margin improvement across our commercial lines portfolio in both the U.S. and internationally, a trend we are confident will continue. We've produced very good earnings and our balance sheet is in excellent shape. Our fourth quarter results were in context of the historic and unprecedented time we live in nationally and globally. 
We continue to face the health, economic, political and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, which might now be more accurately viewed as an endemic on which despite the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics, will likely be with us for years to come. 
Before I go further with the quarter, I want to make a few comments about recent events in our country. We all witnessed the shocking display of demagoguery and insurrection by a group of our own citizens in our nation's capital in early January. We witnessed a scene in our capital building never before viewed in our country's 200-year history, including a totally unacceptable display of symbols of hate, bigotry, violence and antisemitism in the halls of Congress. 
The incident has left our country shaken and our international image tarnished. Some members of Congress attempting to subvert the will of the people and stand in the way of what is largely a ceremonial affirmation of the electoral college vote was also unacceptable. At the end of the day, the facts are the facts. All of the independent institutions, recharge with overseeing our election process, including the Department of Justice, the new Federal cyber watchdog agency, state and federal courts and state election officials investigated, opined and confirmed there was no widespread election fraud. Just because you don't like the political outcome, doesn't give you the right to make up your own facts or attempt to subvert our democracy and the rule of law. This isn't going away, and there's a wake-up call to all of us who care about and love our country. 
Now returning to our fourth quarter results. We recorded core operating income of $3.18 per share, up nearly 40% from prior year, and net income of $2.4 billion or $5.34 per share, up over 100%, and which, by the way, was a record. We produced strong premium revenue growth in the quarter, with global P&C net premiums written which exclude agriculture, up 6%. Our P&C combined ratio of 87.6%, along with very good net earned premium growth produced P&C underwriting income of $969 million, up 82%. While our current accident year underwriting results, excluding cats, were even better, supported by continued underwriting margin improvement and excellent revenue growth in our commercial P&C businesses globally as we continue to capitalize on more favorable underwriting conditions. 
The current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, was 86.4% compared to 90% prior year. The 3.6 point -- percentage points of improvement included 2.8 points of loss ratio related improvement, which was broad-based, and let me give you a better sense of this. Agriculture improved 27 points. And then excluding agriculture, the global P&C commercial lines loss ratio improved about 1.5 percentage points, virtually all as a result of earned rate exceeding loss cost trend. The loss ratio for global P&C consumer lines, which is Global A&H and Global Personal lines improved 1.2 percentage points. The vast majority of which was indirect COVID benefit related.  Phil will discuss the expense ratio improvement in the quarter. 
To very briefly recap the year, though we had an entire quarter of earnings lost to our effort to reserve COVID to ultimate and a very active year of natural catastrophes, we produced $3.3 billion of core operating earnings. The full year published P&C combined ratio was 96.1% compared to 90.6% in '19. The full year P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, was 86.7% compared to 89.2%, which speaks to our underlying health. And our full year premium revenue growth is about 5.5% in constant dollar, with commercial lines growth of 9.3%. 
I mentioned in the beginning, a strong balance sheet. The strength of our loss reserves, which is the most important part of the balance sheet, improved throughout the year. Consistent with our practices, we continue to recognize bad news early and any potential good news late. On the one hand, there have been no changes to our P&C COVID-19 incurred loss charge, which we consider adequate to absorb COVID losses that may emerge. The vast majority of the charge remains IBNR. 
On the other hand, we have recognized only a modest degree, the reduction in losses mostly frequency due to the economic shutdowns. Beyond COVID related, we have also purposely strengthened reserves. Increasing the strength of our reserves is the prudent thing to do given the uncertainty in the environment. Book and tangible book value per share were up 7.7% and 12.2%, respectively, for the year. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period development. 
Turning to growth and the rate environment. As I said, global P&C premium revenue in the quarter which excludes agriculture, grew 6%, comprising 11.3% growth in commercial P&C and 3.9% decline in consumer lines. The consumer lines result included negative growth in global A&H and international personal lines and positive growth in North America personal lines. In the quarter, we continued to experience a strong and continuously improving commercial P&C pricing environment globally. 
In fact, the level of rate and rate of increase was the strongest since this part of the underwriting cycle began approximately 3 years ago. I expect the favorable underwriting conditions to continue. In North America commercial P&C, net premiums grew 10%. And that actually includes a reduction in growth of 3 points due to reduced exposures from the decline in economic activity. New business was up nearly 12%, and renewal retention remains strong at over 95% on a premium basis. 
In our North America Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew over 11.5%, while our middle market and small commercial business grew nearly 8%. Overall rates increased in North America commercial P&C by 16.5%, with a loss cost trend of approximately 5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business. 
Let me give you a better sense of the rate movement. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty, up 7%, while general casualty rates were up over 36% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up over 30% and financial lines rates were up over 26%. 
In our E&S wholesale business, the Westchester, property rates were up over 23%. Casualty rates were up nearly 29% and financial lines rates were up over 26%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up over 15%. casualty rates were up nearly 12%, excluding workers' comp, with workers' comp rates up about 0.5% and financial lines rates were up over 20%. 
In our International General insurance operations, commercial P&C net written premiums grew 14% in the quarter. Our international retail commercial business grew 9%, and our London wholesale business grew over 32%. 
Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region. With net written premiums up 17.5% in the U.K., about 16.5% in the continent and over 16% in Asia Pacific, while Latin America shrank 14%. And as a combination of insurance market and economic conditions weigh on Latin America. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate-to-exposure across our commercial portfolio. And overseas churn rates were up 18.5% overall, with a loss cost trend of 3%. Rates were up 17% in international and retail and 26% in London wholesale. 
Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter, continues to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. Our International personal lines business and our global A&H business together shrank 8%. We expect growth to return and to begin to return in these businesses as the year goes along. 
Our North America high net worth personal lines business, what we call personal risk services, however, remains an exception, with net premiums up 2.5% in the quarter. We continue to experience slight safety and quality in our high net worth segment. New business was up 6.5% and retention remained strong at about 92.3%, while we continue to achieve rate increases of 4.5%. 
Our Global Re business grew its net premiums written about 14.5%. And lastly, in our Asia focused international life insurance business net written premiums were up 25% in the quarter. In sum, we are in a continuing hard or firming market for commercial P&C in most all parts of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is a rational and necessary response to years of underpricing of risk and a more uncertain risk environment today. 
Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. Some lines are there, while others have a way to go. Virtually all of our commercial P&C lines of business throughout the year have been achieving rates that exceed loss cost, and so margins continue to improve. 
Looking forward, we are off to a very good start to the year in the first quarter. Both growth and the level of rate increase we are achieving look a lot like the fourth quarter. Based on everything we see, the current commercial market condition has legs. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. 
And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. By almost any measure, our company performed admirably and distinguished itself during the past year. And I applaud, and I'm so grateful to our more than 31,000 Chubb colleagues around the globe, whose resilience, determination and dedication have produced distinguishing results for our clients and shareholders in spite of work from home conditions.
I also want to recognize our global management team. Who lead and reinforce our culture and discipline, a well head of our performance every single day. 
In closing, our company finished the year with a strong performance and momentum that continues. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are, in fact, growing exposure. Our people are energized, and we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably and increase shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then we're going to come back and take your questions."

We completed an eventful year with solid financial results and continued to build on our balance sheet strength, including substantial capital of almost $75 billion, supported by extraordinary Fed actions, our double AA rated portfolio of",775,"Thank you, Evan. We completed an eventful year with solid financial results and continued to build on our balance sheet strength, including substantial capital of almost $75 billion, supported by extraordinary Fed actions, our double AA rated portfolio of cash and invested assets grew almost $10 billion for the year and now exceeds $120 billion. Our excellent underlying -- underwriting and investment performance produced very strong operating cash flow of $2.5 billion for the quarter and a record $9.8 billion for the year. 
Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $542 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $190 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders or 58% of earnings, including $1.4 billion in dividends and $516 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $924 million and $3.6 billion for the year. Investment income in the quarter was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities and greater private equity distributions. 
While there were a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million. Separately, our policy has always been to record the change in the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses, instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark, if included in investment income, would have increased adjusted net investment income by $485 million for the quarter and $714 million for the year. 
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 10.7% and 17.1%, respectively for the quarter. If we had included the fair value mark on our private equity portfolio and our core operating income, core operating ROE would have been higher by 3.5 percentage points for the quarter. 
During the past few quarters, since S&P Global Ratings published a ratings update on Chubb, management has had discussions with S&P regarding Chubb's track record of strong and diverse underwriting results and operating performance. This has resulted in the company updating its capital management policy to calibrate its estimate of capital adequacy from S&P's AAA level to S&P's AA level. 
We believe this is sufficient to maintain our AA rating. Our capital management policy remains consistent. We hold surplus capital for both risk and opportunity. Our undeployed capital on a run rate basis, dilutes our core operating ROE by around 200 basis points. 
We are also announcing today that our Board has increased the authorization to repurchase shares by $1 billion. Our total repurchase program now allows for up to $2.5 billion between January 1 and December 31, 2021. Book and intangible book value increased 5.4% and 8%, respectively, for the quarter, and 7.4% and 11.9%, respectively, for the year. Book and tangible book value were favorably impacted by after-tax net realized and unrealized gains of $2 billion for the quarter and $2.5 billion for the year. 
The gains were principally in our investment portfolio, primarily from the narrowing of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio, a decline in interest rates and the fair value mark on private equities. 
At December 31, our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $4.7 billion after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $314 million pretax or $271 million after tax. The P&C catastrophe losses of $296 million were primarily from a series of severe weather-related events globally. There were no changes to the previously reported estimate of our P&C COVID impaired loss charge from June 30. 
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $206 million pretax or $189 million after tax. This included $94 million pretax adverse development from our legacy runoff exposures, principally related to asbestos. The remaining favorable development of $300 million is split 70% from long tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior and 30% from short-tail lines. 
For the year, our net loss reserves increased $4.3 billion in constant dollars, and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 80%. The P&C expense ratio was 28% in the quarter with a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year. About half of the improvement is from the health-related shutdown and the balance is principally from operating efficiencies. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.2% for the quarter and 15.8% for the year. For 2021, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. 
I'll turn the call back to Karen."

And we've stood out and given -- and therefore, garnered a lot more credibility and confidence from our clients. Chubb has been consistent in its approach about underwriting and its need for rate throughout the years. Particularly when we were shrinking and know when we couldn't achieve what we required to earn an adequate return. 
And at the same time, given the rate environment changing, our appetite consistent. We continue to promote. And on the same basis, our appetite for the amount of risk we'll take the classes of business that we will serve, where we will serve them. All of that is a well-understood story about us. 
And finally, what I'd say is we don't serve them in 1 line of business, or 2 lines of business, we serve to them broadly across virtually all of their needs. And the secret, we do it on a local basis. It isn't simply that we operate from 2 or 3 hubs, we're where they do business and where they need to work with us and see us every single day.

So we're obviously seeing continued positive rate trend there, 16.5 points in the fourth quarter. I guess my question is, if I look at the current accident year loss ratio ex cat, about 120 basis points improvement year-over-year that compares to an average rate, I think that you guys have said over the last 5 quarters, it's been well above 10%, I think closer to 13%. So it sounds like it's -- I would say, maybe 8 points above trend roughly. I guess I'm wondering what are the moving pieces here I'm thinking maybe mix shifts, that would explain why we're not seeing more of that rate above trend come through in the loss ratio."

I also broke down this quarter's loss ratio margin improvement. And as you heard, there was a greater percentage of improvement for commercial P&C than there was for consumer lines within global P&C. And so you are seeing margin improvement. 
On the other hand, we are striving and will achieve an adequate risk-adjusted return, which says that we're pegging ourselves to achieve a result like that. We raised the bar in a market like this, where we're growing exposure, and there is more loss cost uncertainty as we look forward, COVID and non-COVID related, we are properly building reserve margin and at the same time, through growth and margin improvement and not a small amount, and a current accident year combined ratio that is world-class, we are delivering tremendous earnings at the same time we're building balance sheet strength, absolutely the right thing to do. And I hope that answers your question.  
And finally, don't be overly simplistic about it and you weren't, you got an average loss cost trend. That varies by category of business and line of business. And we are also growing in areas that is, to some degree, changing our mix right now. Something else, I'm -- that's proprietary, I'm not going to go into.

It's not -- so it's not simply economic. It's the shutdown and travel. And imagine -- let's take it for a couple of ends. You would think of travel as simply, okay, retail travel insurance that you sell-through travel agents, et cetera, or airlines. It's actually a small part of it. 
Employers and employer purchased insurance where it's really -- it's purchased not for employees sitting in the office, it's purchased because they have employees traveling all the time, travel accident insurance, as an example. With travel down and then on top of it, economic -- the economic headwinds, that impacts overall A&H, a major part of A&H around the globe, whether it's in the United States, Europe, Asia or Latin America. 
Credit related, we have a huge direct marketing book of business, and it is principally Asia and Latin America. And with people taking less credit on one hand. And secondly, not just tied to credit, but marketing to their customer bases, the middle-income customer for supplemental insurances, A&H, modest homeowners and householders related. I think on the credit side as well, mortgages with economic activity down, that business slows down substantially. 
We are seeing signs of it, and it is beginning to pick back up, but it has a ways to grow in Asia, in particular, and believe it or not, in parts of Latin America, like Chile, and to some degree in places like Brazil. So the business does start to -- and we're seeing it in the first quarter begin a bit in different areas to pick up and then, of course, as you go further into the year beginning with second quarter, you start getting a year-on-year comparison."

Beyond that, the cyber itself is in a state of change. And the product is evolving and will evolve. It's a lot beyond pricing. Pricing is the easy part of it. It's -- that the loss environment, which I've been speaking about for numerous quarters consistently is changing. And so I'll just remind everyone, frequency of loss has been increasing as the world has digitized, and we gave it a huge shove during COVID and work remotely conditions, the world is more cyber and digitally integrated. 
And that raises both exposure in terms of frequency of loss, but it also raises and continues to raise the catastrophe nature of the product because of the interconnectedness of everyone globally, I have said for a number of quarters that the next pandemic, the exposure that looks like a virus is cyber related because it has no geographic or time-bound to it. We've seen a number of events over the recent years that give a glimmer of that. So it is complicated. 
And the product has to evolve to recognize that kind of exposure, both on the frequency side and the severity side. And we have a fabulous team of cyber experts who've been doing this for quite a while, you got at the same time, be humble and know what you don't know and not over imagine, there's a lot of basis risk in it, even the cyber -- all the cyber experts are constantly surprised with new day 0 events and techniques that emerge.

We're very large, maybe the global leader in major account business. And then we're a top-tier middle market company. All of that goes, and I was pretty clear that the level of rate increase we're getting varies by the market area. And then beyond that, it varies by product area, and I gave you some sense of that. 
We have years and years of data. And it's not just data. It's been turned into information, and it has taken us a long time to do that and to do it properly, and so the management information flow here is so well connected between the reserving process and the rate making process in a granular, real-time way and updated based on loss and loss cost trends and actual in virtually real time, without a lot of lag. 
And it is something that all of us at all levels have great transparency and availability to access and that links back with then how we look at what business are we quoting. What business are we binding and at what terms and conditions? It doesn't mean that it's all perfect and we don't make mistakes. And given loss cost and real-world about the loss environment that we don't get surprised on the margin because things change swiftly here or there, of course. 
But we react quickly and finally, what I'd say to you is it's no different than this conversation that goes on about, well, how come you haven't produced more margin. Well, we're producing outstanding margin and margin improvement. It's that -- look at our reserving policy. It's that we recognize bad news, almost immediately and we recognize good news over time. 
The commercial P&C business, particularly the casualty areas are not for optimists, and I've said this many times, and by the way, the notion of prior period reserve development. Well, that's a strength. And that's part of being prudent on recognizing slowly when you're conservative and cautious about a loss cost environment. So it's the data, it's the technology, it's the knowledge of the people, and it's the management policies and practices consistently that make the difference."

We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat u",1514,"Good morning. We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat underwriting results and simply world-class margins. It was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. Though even with that, we produced a really good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk-adjusted underwriting returns. 
The published P&C combined ratio was [ 91.8% ] and included catastrophe losses of 9.1 percentage points compared with 3.3 last year. The current accident year combined without cats was 85.2% compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point improvement was made up of a point of loss ratio with the balance related to the expense ratio. Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5%, and that excludes private equity gains, which most other companies include. On that basis, investment income grew 50%. In sum, core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion. While net income of $2.3 billion was up significantly over prior year's $252 million. 
Phil will have more to say about the expense ratio, cat, prior period development, investment income and book value. 
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 9.7% globally, with commercial premiums up 15.6% and consumer lines down [ 2.5. ] Foreign exchange had a positive impact on growth of 1.6 points. The consumer lines result included negative growth in Global A&H, flat revenue in international personal lines, and about 2.5% underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very strong Commercial P&C pricing environment globally. And based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will endure. 
Chubb was built in all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions. In North America, Commercial P&C premiums grew almost 15%. New business was up [ 21.7% ] and renewal retentions remain strong at 95% on a premium basis. In North America, Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew about 17.5% or about 15%, excluding year-over-year impact of large structured transactions. Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are trending up about 5.5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business. 
Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%. General casualty rates were up 34.5%, and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 20%, and financial lines rates were up almost 21%. 
In our E&S wholesale business, property was up 15.5% casualty and financial lines rates were up 25%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up 16%. Casualty was up 12%, excluding comp, with comp up 1%, and financial lines rates were up 18.5%. In our international General Insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20% on a published basis, or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about 17.5%, and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%. Retail commercial growth varied by region. With premiums up over 26.5% in Asia Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the continent. 
Our Latin America commercial lines business returned to growth in the quarter, with premiums up 4.7%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. And overseas gen, rates were up about 14.5%, with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale business. Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we faced from negative exposure growth due to reduced business activity. 
On the other hand, consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemics effects on consumer-related activities. During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning, breaking consumer down between A&H and personal lines. Our international personal lines business produced modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat, constant dollar. While our international A&H business shrank 3.7%. 
Travel globally, both business and consumer-related remains depressed, and that hits A&H hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&H business is beginning to pick up modestly. If we exclude the travel business, our international A&H business grew almost 2% on a published basis. We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult. 
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 2.5%, excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California and wildfire exposure-related cancellations. As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb for the service and richness of coverage, and we're willing to pay for them. These client segments, which are at the heart of what we do, grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94%, and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowners portfolio. 
Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To that point, we're taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $50 million or about 1.25% impact on our growth rate. Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said the past few quarters or longer, we are in a harder-firming market for commercial P&C in most of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is irrational and necessary to response to years of industry underpricing, and a more uncertain risk environment today driven by climate change, the litigation environment and cyber-related exposures. Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting, and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus. Though we're never perfect. Some lines are there. Others have a way to go. Virtually all of our commercial P&C lines of business continue to achieve rates that exceed loss cost, and so margins continue to improve. As you can see, we're off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. 
And as I said, I expect that as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. Our organization is focused. It's mission-driven. The quality of Chubb's service and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the well head of our reputation. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused. And we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably. While increasing shareholder value. In light of recent events concerning the [ Hartford ] and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want to reiterate, once again, are enduring views concerning M&A and capital management. We look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and product areas. And we pull the trigger infrequently. We have lots of optionality. We have made 17 acquisitions over the past 15 years, and have an excellent track record of advancing the company's capabilities while creating shareholder value. Our approach is steady and consistent. We are extremely patient disciplined, and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building organically and is good for shareholders, we won't hesitate to pull the trigger. 
As regards surplus capital, we're again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both organic and nonorganic, beyond that, we return surplus capital to shareholders. We are highly confident about our future and wealth creation prospects, and we approach the [ Hartford ] from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create additional value, and would not distract us from capitalizing our organic growth opportunity. 
With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our company's business. I'll now turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet includes a $121 billion AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets. We have over $74 billion in capital, stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $519 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our estimated range, and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, for the quarter. 
Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE. Book and tangible book value per share decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after-tax in our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion after tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities and in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. At March 31, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gain position of $2.8 billion after tax. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from severe weather-related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in the U.S. 
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $192 million pretax or $156 million after tax. The favorable development is split approximately 20% in long-tail lines principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 80% in short-tail lines. There was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&C COVID-19 losses, the majority of which remain as incurred, but not reported. 
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion, and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 77%. The P&C administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter, improved by 70 basis points over the prior year, about half related to onetime items that we don't expect to repeat. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year. 
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

I guess with your numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there's still quite a bit of a gap there. That's good. A little bit narrow than what you said prior, but I guess, 2-part question is how adequate are current rates across the board? It's hard to imagine they're not. And then, I guess, and -- say, you want to push for exposure growth still. So is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing gap in the rate versus loss trend."

And this obsession with our rate increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating, where is it? What are you trying to achieve? You're trying to achieve a risk-adjusted return, which translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk-adjusted return. So let's call that 15%, or it depends on the line of business, let's call it 15%. And as you approach that as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at least loss cost. We're achieving. We have more and more of our portfolio, and it's proprietary, so I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper risk-adjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident year basis, and we measure both of them. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase and look at the margin between the rate and exposure -- and loss cost [indiscernible] Now with that, let me go a step further for you because of this obsession about this. When I look at the third and fourth quarter last year, and I measure the first quarter against it right now, and I'm taking the time on this question because I know all of your colleagues or most of them have this question on their minds. When I look at the level of rate increase, this quarter measured against prior. Okay. Property in North America, in aggregate, got rate increases in the mid-teens, which is about 2 to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third and fourth quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on rate. When I look at primary casualty, the rates are up, they're higher than they were on the average. When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat with the average of the quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When I look at marine, it's up. When I look at aviation, it's flat to down. When I do this internationally, kind of the same trend, property down 2 to 3 points, the rate of increase from what it was the other 2 quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat. Financial lines is up. And marine is down. So -- no, sorry. Marine is up, and aviation is down a little bit. So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to answer that question that -- from every angle I can that I know is on everyone's mind. You know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike."

I guess, how should we think about where to go from here for maybe another capital deployment round of authorization versus more organic or just kind of what can we expect for what was possible to be used there and, how it might be used in the near term?"

And North America is in the single digits, and continuing to head marginally lower. And it will, through efficiencies, which I have talked about numerous times that with technology and in all forms. So I won't go into it in great detail. But analytics, robotics, straight-through processing, et cetera. We are on track to continue to drive efficiencies in the operations. And the same in overseas general, the difference there is you're across 50-some-odd countries. And so by its nature, you have a different expense structure, and it continues to improve. So we're growing our P&C business, the commercial businesses, at a rate far in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses up marginally, so we're leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up, but you also got the added benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also. It runs a lower acquisition cost then does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher loss ratio. That's just axiomatic [indiscernible] That business will continue to operate in the range that it's in that you see right now, up or down a couple of [ tenths of a percent ] in my mind as we look forward. The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have a higher acquisition cost, the operating expense, so the internal expense ratio will go down because you will have more volume returning against it. But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line. It will become a greater mix of our total. And so that will go the other way. It's just natural. And -- but that business then runs a lower loss ratio. The margins are excellent, as you know. So maybe that gives you the color you're looking for."

The market place in terms of rate is striving the marketplace because you operate within the marketplace is striving for 2 things. And that is, you have those who have a hole to fill because they have deficiency in lines of business. Remember, the industry operates like a giant or retro. And then they also need rate for adequacy today. That's the marketplace. If you have operated at adequacy along the way, you don't have that first part that hole to fill and achieving market rate, you're achieving better than adequate. And that benefits you. We'll see. We're in a -- we're certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the transient impact of COVID. And so we'll see how it all plays in terms of margin. We play things conservatively. But we are receiving rate that ensures the portfolio will achieve adequacy in terms of risk-adjusted rate of return across the book. And if we have more than that, well, that will just speak for itself over time. That's the best I can give you."

But it's coming back and that continue to do very well. It's bank distribution, both branch and direct marketing related. It's more credit-related-type products and short-term than it is long-term product, though there is a mix of that in the portfolio. When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly, right now and in this quarter, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, doing well.

So the organic growth, and those are agency based businesses for the most part, with some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan. But if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, and those are predominantly -- those are agency businesses, where our agency force is growing. These are long-term products, guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there's a healthy mix of savings and protection product. And that business is -- we built it from dust predominantly. And it's cast in a shadow. It's a few billion dollars now. And I see great growth potential for that. As regards M&A, I made the statement. When I came to the end of my commentary, I said we have lots of optionality. We have optionality. When we're looking at opportunity, what that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments, and that includes the life insurance business.

We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat u",1502,"Good morning. We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat underwriting results and simply world-class margins. It was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. Though even with that, we produced a really good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk-adjusted underwriting returns.
The published P&C combined ratio was 91.8% and included catastrophe losses of 9.1 percentage points compared with 3.3% last year. The current accident year combined without cats was 85.2% compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point improvement was made up of a point of loss ratio with the balance related to the expense ratio.
Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5% and that excludes private equity gains, which most other companies include. On that basis, investment income grew 50%. In sum, core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion. While net income of $2.3 billion was up significantly over prior year's $252 million. Phil will have more to say about the expense ratio, cat, prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 9.7% globally, with commercial premiums up 15.6% and consumer lines down 2.5%. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on growth of 1.6 points. The consumer lines result included negative growth in Global A&H, flat revenue in international personal lines and about 2.5% underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very strong Commercial P&C pricing environment globally. And based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will endure.
Chubb was built in all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions. In North America, Commercial P&C premiums grew almost 15%. New business was up 21.7% and renewal retentions remain strong at 95% on a premium basis. In North America, Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew about 17.5% or about 15%, excluding year-over-year impact of large structured transactions. Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are trending up about 5.5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%. General casualty rates were up 34.5% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 20%, and financial lines rates were up almost 21%.
In our E&S wholesale business, property was up 15.5%. Casualty and financial lines rates were up 25%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up 16%. Casualty was up 12%, excluding comp, with comp up 1%, and financial lines rates were up 18.5%.
In our International General Insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20% on a published basis or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about 17.5%, and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up over 26.5% in Asia Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the continent.
Our Latin America commercial lines business returned to growth in the quarter, with premiums up 4.7%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In overseas gen, rates were up about 14.5%, with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale business. Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we faced from negative exposure growth due to reduced business activity.
On the other hand, consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning, breaking consumer down between A&H and personal lines. Our international personal lines business produced modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat, constant dollar. While our international A&H business shrank 3.7%.
Travel globally, both business and consumer-related remains depressed and that hits A&H hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&H business is beginning to pick up modestly, if we exclude the travel business, our international A&H business grew almost 2% on a published basis. We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult.
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 2.5%, excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California and wildfire exposure-related cancellations. As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb for the service and richness of coverage, and we're willing to pay for them. These client segments, which are at the heart of what we do, grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94% and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowners' portfolio.
Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To that point, we're taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $50 million or about 1.25% impact on our growth rate.
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said the past few quarters or longer, we are in a harder-firming market for Commercial P&C in most of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is irrational and necessary to response to years of industry underpricing and a more uncertain risk environment today driven by climate change, the litigation environment and cyber-related exposures.
Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus, though we're never perfect. Some lines are there, others have a way to go. Virtually, all of our Commercial P&C lines of business continue to achieve rates that exceed loss cost and so margins continue to improve. As you can see, we're off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins.
And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. Our organization is focused. It's mission-driven. The quality of Chubb's service and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the well head of our reputation. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused. And we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably, while increasing shareholder value.
In light of recent events concerning the Hartford and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want to reiterate once again, our enduring views concerning M&A and capital management. We look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and product areas and we pull the trigger infrequently. We have lots of optionality. We have made 17 acquisitions over the past 15 years and have an excellent track record of advancing the company's capabilities, while creating shareholder value.
Our approach is steady and consistent. We are extremely patient, disciplined and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building organically and is good for shareholders, we won't hesitate to pull the trigger.
As regards surplus capital, we're again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both organic and nonorganic. Beyond that, we return surplus capital to shareholders. We are highly confident about our future and wealth-creation prospects, and we approach the Hartford from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create additional value and would not distract us from capitalizing our organic growth opportunity.
With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our company's business. I'll now turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet includes a $121 billion AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets. We have over $74 billion in capital, stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $519 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, for the quarter. Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE.
Book and tangible book value per share decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after tax in our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion after tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities and in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.
At March 31, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gain position of $2.8 billion after tax. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from severe weather-related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in the U.S.
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $192 million pretax or $156 million after tax. The favorable development is split approximately 20% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 80% in short-tail lines. There was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&C COVID-19 losses, the majority of which remain as incurred, but not reported.
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion, and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 77%. The P&C administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter improved by 70 basis points over the prior year, about half related to onetime items that we don't expect to repeat. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

I guess I want to focus first on -- you sound still very bullish on commercial lines and exposure growth that you want to push for. You said last quarter, commercial lines have legs. This quarter, you're confident that conditions will continue or endure?
I guess with your numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there's still quite a bit of a gap there. That's good. A little bit narrow than what you said prior, but I guess, 2-part question is how adequate are current rates across the board? It's hard to imagine they're not. And then, I guess, and -- so you want to push for exposure growth still. So is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing gap in the rate versus loss trend?"

And this obsession with our rate increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating, where is it? What are you trying to achieve? You're trying to achieve a risk-adjusted return, which translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk-adjusted return. So let's call that 15% or it depends on the line of business, let's call it 15%. And as you approach that, as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at least loss cost. We're achieving.
We have more and more of our portfolio, and it's proprietary. So I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper risk-adjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident year basis, and we measure both. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase and look at the margin between the rate and exposure -- and loss cost trend.
Now with that, let me go a step further for you because of this obsession about this. When I look at the third and fourth quarter last year and I measure the first quarter against it right now, and I'm taking the time on this question because I know all of your colleagues or most of them have this question on their minds. When I look at the level of rate increase, this quarter measured against the prior. Okay. Property in North America, in aggregate, got rate increases in the mid-teens, which is about 2 to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third and fourth quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on rate.
When I look at primary casualty, the rates are up. They're higher than they were on the average. When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat with the average of the quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When I look at marine, it's up. When I look at aviation, it's flat to down. When I do this internationally, kind of the same trend, property down 2 to 3 points, the rate of increase from what it was the other 2 quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat. Financial lines is up. And marine is down. So -- no, sorry, marine is up. And aviation is down a little bit.
So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to answer that question that -- from every angle I can that I know is on everyone's mind. You know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike."

You're very infrequently -- pull the trigger infrequently. If something like that size is off the table and the conditions are still pretty right, I guess, how should we think about where to go from here for maybe another capital deployment round of authorization versus more organic? Or just kind of what can we expect for what was possible to be used there and how it might be used in the near term?"

And North America is in the single digits and continuing to head marginally lower. And it will through efficiencies, which I have talked about numerous times that with technology and in all forms. So I won't go into it in great detail, but analytics, robotics, straight-through processing, et cetera. We are on track to continue to drive efficiencies in the operations.
And the same in overseas general, the difference there is you're across 50-some-odd countries. And so by its nature, you have a different expense structure and it continues to improve. So we're growing our P&C business, the commercial businesses, at a rate far in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses up marginally, so we're leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up, but you also got the added benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also.
It runs a lower acquisition cost then does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher loss ratio. That's just axiomatic and true event. That business will continue to operate in the range that it's in that you see right now, up or down a couple of tenths of a percent in my mind as we look forward.
The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have a higher acquisition cost, the operating expense. So the internal expense ratio will go down because you will have more volume returning against it. But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line, it will become a greater mix of our total. And so that will go the other way. It's just natural. And -- but that business then runs a lower loss ratio. The margins are excellent, as you know. So maybe that gives you the color you're looking for."

The marketplace in terms of rate is striving the marketplace because you operate within the marketplace is striving for 2 things. And that is, you have those who have a hole to fill because they have deficiency in lines of business. Remember, the industry operates like a giant retro. And then they also need rate for adequacy today. That's the marketplace.
If you have operated at adequacy along the way, you don't have that first part that hole to fill. And achieving market rate, you're achieving better than adequate and that benefits you. We'll see. We're in a -- we're certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the transient impact of COVID. And so we'll see how it all plays in terms of margin. We play things conservatively. But we are receiving rate that ensures the portfolio will achieve adequacy in terms of risk-adjusted rate of return across the book.

Secondly, on the casualty side, given the litigation environment and across different lines of business, you know we have watched and have talked about it endlessly that it is -- the loss cost environment there is not benign. And so as we always relentlessly study our trends across each class, we reflect it over a period of time in how we view loss cost and we react very quickly, particularly if there's any bad news.

And Chile is a great market, but Chile has truly been suffering from COVID and the lockdown. And while it's a very good business, it has some headwind in terms of growth related to that. But it's coming back and that'll continue to do very well. It's bank distribution, both branch and direct marketing related. It's more credit-related-type products and short term than it is long-term product, though there is a mix of that in the portfolio.
When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly right now and in this quarter, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan doing well. And our business in Korea getting better, but it's small and it will take a while to cash shot up. What's not consolidated in those numbers, but we -- that we add as a line item because we don't have over 50% yet is the increase in Wan Tai, which is doing well.
And by the way, we are on our path. And it's at a very sensitive moment, so I don't want to talk about it much, but that will consolidate. I'm confident we'll finish what we got to get done to be able to consolidate Wan Tai. And that life business is growing well. So the organic growth, and those are agency-based businesses for the most part with some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan.
But if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China and those are predominantly -- those are agency businesses, where our agency force is growing. These are long-term products, guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there's a healthy mix of savings and protection product. And that business is -- we built it from dust predominantly and it's cast in a shadow. It's a few billion dollars now. And I see great growth potential for that.
As regards M&A, I made the statement. When I came to the end of my commentary, I said we have lots of optionality. We have optionality. When we're looking at opportunity, what that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments and that includes the life insurance business.

We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat u",1502,"Good morning. We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat underwriting results and simply world-class margins. It was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. Though even with that, we produced a really good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk-adjusted underwriting returns.
The published P&C combined ratio was 91.8% and included catastrophe losses of 9.1 percentage points compared with 3.3% last year. The current accident year combined without cats was 85.2% compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point improvement was made up of a point of loss ratio with the balance related to the expense ratio.
Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5% and that excludes private equity gains, which most other companies include. On that basis, investment income grew 50%. In sum, core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion. While net income of $2.3 billion was up significantly over prior year's $252 million. Phil will have more to say about the expense ratio, cat, prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 9.7% globally, with commercial premiums up 15.6% and consumer lines down 2.5%. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on growth of 1.6 points. The consumer lines result included negative growth in Global A&H, flat revenue in international personal lines and about 2.5% underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very strong Commercial P&C pricing environment globally. And based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will endure.
Chubb was built in all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions. In North America, Commercial P&C premiums grew almost 15%. New business was up 21.7% and renewal retentions remain strong at 95% on a premium basis. In North America, Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew about 17.5% or about 15%, excluding year-over-year impact of large structured transactions. Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are trending up about 5.5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%. General casualty rates were up 34.5% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 20%, and financial lines rates were up almost 21%.
In our E&S wholesale business, property was up 15.5%. Casualty and financial lines rates were up 25%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up 16%. Casualty was up 12%, excluding comp, with comp up 1%, and financial lines rates were up 18.5%.
In our International General Insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20% on a published basis or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about 17.5%, and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up over 26.5% in Asia Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the continent.
Our Latin America commercial lines business returned to growth in the quarter, with premiums up 4.7%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In overseas gen, rates were up about 14.5%, with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale business. Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we faced from negative exposure growth due to reduced business activity.
On the other hand, consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning, breaking consumer down between A&H and personal lines. Our international personal lines business produced modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat, constant dollar. While our international A&H business shrank 3.7%.
Travel globally, both business and consumer-related remains depressed and that hits A&H hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&H business is beginning to pick up modestly, if we exclude the travel business, our international A&H business grew almost 2% on a published basis. We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult.
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 2.5%, excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California and wildfire exposure-related cancellations. As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb for the service and richness of coverage, and we're willing to pay for them. These client segments, which are at the heart of what we do, grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94% and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowners' portfolio.
Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To that point, we're taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $50 million or about 1.25% impact on our growth rate.
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said the past few quarters or longer, we are in a harder-firming market for Commercial P&C in most of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is irrational and necessary to response to years of industry underpricing and a more uncertain risk environment today driven by climate change, the litigation environment and cyber-related exposures.
Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus, though we're never perfect. Some lines are there, others have a way to go. Virtually, all of our Commercial P&C lines of business continue to achieve rates that exceed loss cost and so margins continue to improve. As you can see, we're off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins.
And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. Our organization is focused. It's mission-driven. The quality of Chubb's service and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the well head of our reputation. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused. And we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably, while increasing shareholder value.
In light of recent events concerning the Hartford and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want to reiterate once again, our enduring views concerning M&A and capital management. We look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and product areas and we pull the trigger infrequently. We have lots of optionality. We have made 17 acquisitions over the past 15 years and have an excellent track record of advancing the company's capabilities, while creating shareholder value.
Our approach is steady and consistent. We are extremely patient, disciplined and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building organically and is good for shareholders, we won't hesitate to pull the trigger.
As regards surplus capital, we're again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both organic and nonorganic. Beyond that, we return surplus capital to shareholders. We are highly confident about our future and wealth-creation prospects, and we approach the Hartford from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create additional value and would not distract us from capitalizing our organic growth opportunity.
With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our company's business. I'll now turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet includes a $121 billion AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets. We have over $74 billion in capital, stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $519 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, for the quarter. Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE.
Book and tangible book value per share decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after tax in our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion after tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities and in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.
At March 31, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gain position of $2.8 billion after tax. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from severe weather-related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in the U.S.
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $192 million pretax or $156 million after tax. The favorable development is split approximately 20% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 80% in short-tail lines. There was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&C COVID-19 losses, the majority of which remain as incurred, but not reported.
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion, and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 77%. The P&C administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter improved by 70 basis points over the prior year, about half related to onetime items that we don't expect to repeat. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

I guess I want to focus first on -- you sound still very bullish on commercial lines and exposure growth that you want to push for. You said last quarter, commercial lines have legs. This quarter, you're confident that conditions will continue or endure?
I guess with your numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there's still quite a bit of a gap there. That's good. A little bit narrow than what you said prior, but I guess, 2-part question is how adequate are current rates across the board? It's hard to imagine they're not. And then, I guess, and -- so you want to push for exposure growth still. So is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing gap in the rate versus loss trend?"

And this obsession with our rate increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating, where is it? What are you trying to achieve?

And this obsession with our rate increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating, where is it? What are you trying to achieve? You're trying to achieve a risk-adjusted return, which translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk-adjusted return. So let's call that 15% or it depends on the line of business, let's call it 15%. And as you approach that, as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at least loss cost. We're achieving.
We have more and more of our portfolio, and it's proprietary. So I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper risk-adjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident year basis, and we measure both. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase and look at the margin between the rate and exposure -- and loss cost trend.
Now with that, let me go a step further for you because of this obsession about this. When I look at the third and fourth quarter last year and I measure the first quarter against it right now, and I'm taking the time on this question because I know all of your colleagues or most of them have this question on their minds. When I look at the level of rate increase, this quarter measured against the prior. Okay. Property in North America, in aggregate, got rate increases in the mid-teens, which is about 2 to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third and fourth quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on rate.
When I look at primary casualty, the rates are up. They're higher than they were on the average. When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat with the average of the quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When I look at marine, it's up. When I look at aviation, it's flat to down. When I do this internationally, kind of the same trend, property down 2 to 3 points, the rate of increase from what it was the other 2 quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat. Financial lines is up. And marine is down. So -- no, sorry, marine is up. And aviation is down a little bit.
So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to answer that question that -- from every angle I can that I know is on everyone's mind. You know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike."

And then it still seems like it's on a general pathway of improvement.
So I was wondering perhaps if you can give us an updated view.

And North America is in the single digits and continuing to head marginally lower. And it will through efficiencies, which I have talked about numerous times that with technology and in all forms. So I won't go into it in great detail, but analytics, robotics, straight-through processing, et cetera. We are on track to continue to drive efficiencies in the operations.
And the same in overseas general, the difference there is you're across 50-some-odd countries. And so by its nature, you have a different expense structure and it continues to improve. So we're growing our P&C business, the commercial businesses, at a rate far in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses up marginally, so we're leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up, but you also got the added benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also.
It runs a lower acquisition cost than does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher loss ratio. That's just axiomatic and true event. That business will continue to operate in the range that it's in that you see right now, up or down a couple of tenths of a percent in my mind as we look forward.
The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have a higher acquisition cost, the operating expense. So the internal expense ratio will go down because you will have more volume returning against it. But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line, it will become a greater mix of our total. And so that will go the other way. It's just natural. And -- but that business then runs a lower loss ratio. The margins are excellent, as you know. So maybe that gives you the color you're looking for."

And then they also need rate for adequacy today. That's the marketplace.
If you have operated at adequacy along the way, you don't have that first part that hole to fill. And achieving market rate, you're achieving better than adequate and that benefits you. We'll see. We're in a -- we're certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the transient impact of COVID. And so we'll see how it all plays in terms of margin. We play things conservatively. But we are receiving rate that ensures the portfolio will achieve adequacy in terms of risk-adjusted rate of return across the book.

Secondly, on the casualty side, given the litigation environment and across different lines of business, you know we have watched and have talked about it endlessly that it is -- the loss cost environment there is not benign. And so as we always relentlessly study our trends across each class, we reflect it over a period of time in how we view loss cost and we react very quickly, particularly if there's any bad news.

And Chile is a great market, but Chile has truly been suffering from COVID and the lockdown. And while it's a very good business, it has some headwind in terms of growth related to that. But it's coming back and that'll continue to do very well. It's bank distribution, both branch and direct marketing related. It's more credit-related-type products and short term than it is long-term product, though there is a mix of that in the portfolio.
When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly right now and in this quarter, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan doing well. And our business in Korea getting better, but it's small and it will take a while to cash shot up. What's not consolidated in those numbers, but we -- that we add as a line item because we don't have over 50% yet is the increase in Wan Tai, which is doing well.
And by the way, we are on our path. And it's at a very sensitive moment, so I don't want to talk about it much, but that will consolidate. I'm confident we'll finish what we got to get done to be able to consolidate Wan Tai. And that life business is growing well. So the organic growth, and those are agency-based businesses for the most part with some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan.
But if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China and those are predominantly -- those are agency businesses, where our agency force is growing. These are long-term products, guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there's a healthy mix of savings and protection product. And that business is -- we built it from dust predominantly and it's cast in a shadow. It's a few billion dollars now. And I see great growth potential for that.
As regards M&A, I made the statement. When I came to the end of my commentary, I said we have lots of optionality. We have optionality. When we're looking at opportunity, what that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments and that includes the life insurance business.

We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat u",1502,"Good morning. We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit Commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading to record ex-cat underwriting results and simply world-class margins. It was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. Though even with that, we produced a really good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk-adjusted underwriting returns.
The published P&C combined ratio was 91.8% and included catastrophe losses of 9.1 percentage points compared with 3.3% last year. The current accident year combined without cats was 85.2% compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point improvement was made up of a point of loss ratio with the balance related to the expense ratio.
Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5% and that excludes private equity gains, which most other companies include. On that basis, investment income grew 50%. In sum, core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion. While net income of $2.3 billion was up significantly over prior year's $252 million. Phil will have more to say about the expense ratio, cat, prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 9.7% globally, with commercial premiums up 15.6% and consumer lines down 2.5%. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on growth of 1.6 points. The consumer lines result included negative growth in Global A&H, flat revenue in international personal lines and about 2.5% underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very strong Commercial P&C pricing environment globally. And based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will endure.
Chubb was built in all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions. In North America, Commercial P&C premiums grew almost 15%. New business was up 21.7% and renewal retentions remain strong at 95% on a premium basis. In North America, Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew about 17.5% or about 15%, excluding year-over-year impact of large structured transactions. Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are trending up about 5.5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%. General casualty rates were up 34.5% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 20%, and financial lines rates were up almost 21%.
In our E&S wholesale business, property was up 15.5%. Casualty and financial lines rates were up 25%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up 16%. Casualty was up 12%, excluding comp, with comp up 1%, and financial lines rates were up 18.5%.
In our International General Insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20% on a published basis or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about 17.5%, and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up over 26.5% in Asia Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the continent.
Our Latin America commercial lines business returned to growth in the quarter, with premiums up 4.7%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In overseas gen, rates were up about 14.5%, with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale business. Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we faced from negative exposure growth due to reduced business activity.
On the other hand, consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning, breaking consumer down between A&H and personal lines. Our international personal lines business produced modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat, constant dollar. While our international A&H business shrank 3.7%.
Travel globally, both business and consumer-related remains depressed and that hits A&H hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&H business is beginning to pick up modestly, if we exclude the travel business, our international A&H business grew almost 2% on a published basis. We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult.
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 2.5%, excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California and wildfire exposure-related cancellations. As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb for the service and richness of coverage, and we're willing to pay for them. These client segments, which are at the heart of what we do, grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94% and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowners' portfolio.
Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To that point, we're taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $50 million or about 1.25% impact on our growth rate.
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said the past few quarters or longer, we are in a harder-firming market for Commercial P&C in most of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is irrational and necessary to response to years of industry underpricing and a more uncertain risk environment today driven by climate change, the litigation environment and cyber-related exposures.
Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus, though we're never perfect. Some lines are there, others have a way to go. Virtually, all of our Commercial P&C lines of business continue to achieve rates that exceed loss cost and so margins continue to improve. As you can see, we're off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins.
And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. Our organization is focused. It's mission-driven. The quality of Chubb's service and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the well head of our reputation. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused. And we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably, while increasing shareholder value.
In light of recent events concerning the Hartford and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want to reiterate once again, our enduring views concerning M&A and capital management. We look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and product areas and we pull the trigger infrequently. We have lots of optionality. We have made 17 acquisitions over the past 15 years and have an excellent track record of advancing the company's capabilities, while creating shareholder value.
Our approach is steady and consistent. We are extremely patient, disciplined and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building organically and is good for shareholders, we won't hesitate to pull the trigger.
As regards surplus capital, we're again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both organic and nonorganic. Beyond that, we return surplus capital to shareholders. We are highly confident about our future and wealth-creation prospects, and we approach the Hartford from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create additional value and would not distract us from capitalizing our organic growth opportunity.
With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our company's business. I'll now turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions."

Our balance sheet includes a $121 billion AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets. We have over $74 billion in capital, stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $519 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, for the quarter. Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE.
Book and tangible book value per share decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after tax in our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion after tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities and in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.
At March 31, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gain position of $2.8 billion after tax. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from severe weather-related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in the U.S.
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $192 million pretax or $156 million after tax. The favorable development is split approximately 20% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 80% in short-tail lines. There was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&C COVID-19 losses, the majority of which remain as incurred, but not reported.
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion, and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 77%. The P&C administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter improved by 70 basis points over the prior year, about half related to onetime items that we don't expect to repeat. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

I guess I want to focus first on -- you sound still very bullish on commercial lines and exposure growth that you want to push for. You said last quarter, commercial lines have legs. This quarter, you're confident that conditions will continue or endure?
I guess with your numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there's still quite a bit of a gap there. That's good. A little bit narrow than what you said prior, but I guess, 2-part question is how adequate are current rates across the board? It's hard to imagine they're not. And then, I guess, and -- so you want to push for exposure growth still. So is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing gap in the rate versus loss trend?"
203028,710055732,2289231,"Chubb Limited, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","It's funny how people think about rate right now. And this obsession with our rate increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating, where is it? What are you trying to achieve?

And this obsession with our rate increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating, where is it? What are you trying to achieve? You're trying to achieve a risk-adjusted return, which translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk-adjusted return. So let's call that 15% or it depends on the line of business, let's call it 15%. And as you approach that, as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at least loss cost. We're achieving.
We have more and more of our portfolio, and it's proprietary. So I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper risk-adjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident year basis, and we measure both. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase and look at the margin between the rate and exposure -- and loss cost trend.
Now with that, let me go a step further for you because of this obsession about this. When I look at the third and fourth quarter last year and I measure the first quarter against it right now, and I'm taking the time on this question because I know all of your colleagues or most of them have this question on their minds. When I look at the level of rate increase, this quarter measured against the prior. Okay. Property in North America, in aggregate, got rate increases in the mid-teens, which is about 2 to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third and fourth quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on rate.
When I look at primary casualty, the rates are up. They're higher than they were on the average. When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat with the average of the quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When I look at marine, it's up. When I look at aviation, it's flat to down. When I do this internationally, kind of the same trend, property down 2 to 3 points, the rate of increase from what it was the other 2 quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat. Financial lines is up. And marine is down. So -- no, sorry, marine is up. And aviation is down a little bit.
So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to answer that question that -- from every angle I can that I know is on everyone's mind. You know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike."

And North America is in the single digits and continuing to head marginally lower. And it will through efficiencies, which I have talked about numerous times that with technology and in all forms. So I won't go into it in great detail, but analytics, robotics, straight-through processing, et cetera. We are on track to continue to drive efficiencies in the operations.
And the same in overseas general, the difference there is you're across 50-some-odd countries. And so by its nature, you have a different expense structure and it continues to improve. So we're growing our P&C business, the commercial businesses, at a rate far in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses up marginally, so we're leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up, but you also got the added benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also.
It runs a lower acquisition cost than does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher loss ratio. That's just axiomatic and true event. That business will continue to operate in the range that it's in that you see right now, up or down a couple of tenths of a percent in my mind as we look forward.
The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have a higher acquisition cost, the operating expense. So the internal expense ratio will go down because you will have more volume returning against it. But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line, it will become a greater mix of our total. And so that will go the other way. It's just natural. And -- but that business then runs a lower loss ratio. The margins are excellent, as you know. So maybe that gives you the color you're looking for."

If you have operated at adequacy along the way, you don't have that first part that hole to fill. And achieving market rate, you're achieving better than adequate and that benefits you. We'll see. We're in a -- we're certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the transient impact of COVID. And so we'll see how it all plays in terms of margin. We play things conservatively.

Secondly, on the casualty side, given the litigation environment and across different lines of business, you know we have watched and have talked about it endlessly that it is -- the loss cost environment there is not benign. And so as we always relentlessly study our trends across each class, we reflect it over a period of time in how we view loss cost and we react very quickly, particularly if there's any bad news.

And Chile is a great market, but Chile has truly been suffering from COVID and the lockdown. And while it's a very good business, it has some headwind in terms of growth related to that. But it's coming back and that'll continue to do very well. It's bank distribution, both branch and direct marketing related. It's more credit-related-type products and short term than it is long-term product, though there is a mix of that in the portfolio.
When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly right now and in this quarter, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan doing well. And our business in Korea getting better, but it's small and it will take a while to cash shot up. What's not consolidated in those numbers, but we -- that we add as a line item because we don't have over 50% yet is the increase in Wan Tai, which is doing well.
And by the way, we are on our path. And it's at a very sensitive moment, so I don't want to talk about it much, but that will consolidate. I'm confident we'll finish what we got to get done to be able to consolidate Wan Tai. And that life business is growing well. So the organic growth, and those are agency-based businesses for the most part with some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan.
But if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China and those are predominantly -- those are agency businesses, where our agency force is growing. These are long-term products, guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there's a healthy mix of savings and protection product. And that business is -- we built it from dust predominantly and it's cast in a shadow. It's a few billion dollars now. And I see great growth potential for that.
As regards M&A, I made the statement. When I came to the end of my commentary, I said we have lots of optionality. We have optionality. When we're looking at opportunity, what that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments and that includes the life insurance business.

All of these plates are spinning. The green book is not yet out that would tell us any detail of what's in the tax reform or the tax increase, tax or a reform proposal. And so we don't even know what the administration is yet proposing other than in headlines. And so we really can't speculate at this point. We just don't know.

As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by record operating earnings and underwriting results, expanded margins and double-digit premium revenue growth globally, the best in over 15 years, powered by commercial P&C and supported by continued robust commercial P&C rate movement.
Chubb was built for these conditions. We have averaged double-digit commercial P&C growth over the past 10 quarters. The breadth of our product and reach, combined with our execution-oriented underwriting culture, and our reputation for service and consistency help us to fully capitalize on opportunity, and conditions such as these size and scale are our friend.
Core operating income in the quarter was $1.62 billion or $3.62 per share, again, both records. On both the reported and current accident year ex-cat basis, underwriting results in the quarter were simply world-class. The published P&C combined ratio was 85.5% and current accident year was 85.4% compared to 87.4% prior year. The 2 percentage points of margin improvement were almost entirely loss ratio related. 
Current accident year underwriting income of $1.2 billion was up 27%. While on the other side of the balance sheet, adjusted net investment income of $945 million, also a record, was up nearly 9.5% from prior year. Peter will have more to say about cats, in prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 15.5% globally, with commercial premiums, excluding agriculture, up nearly 21%. The 15.5% growth for the quarter and 12.6% for the first 6 months were the strongest growth we have seen since 2004. Growth in the quarter was extremely broad-based, with contributions from virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally, from those serving large companies, to midsize, small and most regions of the world and distribution channels.
We continue to experience a needed and robust commercial P&C pricing environment in most all important regions of the world, with continued year-on-year improvement in rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal. Based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will continue.
In North America, Commercial P&C net premiums grew over 16%. New business was up 24%, and renewal retention remained strong at 96.5% on a premium basis. In our North America major accounts and specialty commercial business, net premiums grew over 13%, with each division, major accounts, Westchester and Bermuda having its largest quarter in history in terms of written business. And the standout was our middle market and small commercial division, which had the biggest quarter in about 20 years, driven by record new business growth and strong retentions.
Overall rates increased in North America commercial by a strong 13.5%, which is on top of a 14.7% rate increase last year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increase over 30%. And remember, in North America, rates have been rising for almost 4 years. However, they have exceeded loss costs for only about 2 years now. Loss costs are currently trending about 5.5% and vary up or down depending upon line of business. General commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%. 
Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement by division and line in North America. In major accounts, rates increased in the quarter by about 16% on top of almost 18% prior year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increase over 36%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up almost 9%. General casualty rates were up 21% and varied by category. Property rates were up nearly 12% and financial lines rates were up almost 20%. 
In our E&S wholesale business, the cumulative 2-year rate increase was 39%, comprised of an increase of circa 18% this quarter on top of 18% prior year second quarter. Property rates were up about 16.5%. Casualty was up about $21 million, and financial lines rates were up over 21%. 
In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter over 9.5% on top of over 9% last year, making the 2-year cumulative increase 20%. Rates for property were up over 10.5%. Casualty rates were up 11%, excluding workers' comp, and comp rates were down at about 0.5%. Financial Lines rates were up over 17.5% in our middle market business.
Turning to our international general insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew an astonishing 33% on a published basis or 24% in constant dollars. International retail commercial grew 27% and our London wholesale business grew 60%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region, with premiums up 36.5% in our Erin pan division, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the continent. Asia Pacific was up over 29%, while our Latin America commercial lines business grew over 14.5%. 
Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail commercial P&C business, the 2-year cumulative rate increase was 35% comprised of increases this quarter and prior year of 16% each.
2 territories in particular, the U.K. and Australia, stand out in terms of rate achievement. In our U.K. business, rates increased in the quarter by 18%, on top of a 26% rate increase prior year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increased 48%. 
In Australia, the 2-year cumulative rate was 42%, comprised of an increase of 23% this quarter, on top of 16% prior year. In our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 13%, on top of a 20% rate increase prior year, so making the 2-year cumulative 36%. 
International markets began firming later in the U.S. And again, like with the U.S., rates has exceeded loss costs for about 2 years now. Outside the U.S., loss costs are currently trending 3%, and so that varies by class of business and country. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic effects on consumer-related activities. Our international consumer business grew 13% in the quarter, and that's on a published basis. It grew 5% in constant dollars.
Breaking that down for you, international personal lines grew 20% on a published basis, while our international A&H grew 6.5%, but it was essentially flat in constant dollar. Within our A&H book, a nascent recovery in our leisure travel business outside of Asia is beginning to result in growth, although passenger travel activity is still well below pre-pandemic levels in both our group A&H business, with its employer-based benefits and our consumer-focused direct marketing business. Premiums were up mid-single digits, still impacted by the pandemic, but beginning to improve.
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up over 2.5%. Nonrenewals in California and COVID auto-related renewal credits had almost 1 point of negative impact on growth in the quarter. Our TruNiNetworkh client segment, the heart of our business, grew almost 8% in the quarter. Overall retention remains strong at over 94%. And we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 13% in our homeowners portfolio. Loss cost inflation in homeowners is currently running about 11%. Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits, were up 55% in the quarter, while net premiums in our Global Re business grew over 32%. 
In sum, we continue to capitalize on a hard or firming market for commercial P&C in most areas of the world. Both growth and margin expansion are 2 trends that I am confident will continue. Our organization is firing on all cylinders. We're growing our business and our exposures, and we continue to expand our margins. Our leadership employees are energized and driven to win. I couldn't be more proud or humbled by the results they are producing, and I want to thank them all publicly for their efforts. I am confident in our ability to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Peter."

First, I'd like to acknowledge Phil Bancroft's almost 20 years of service and leadership with the company. I'm excited to be in my new position and build upon all that he has achieved -- all he has achieved under his leadership, and I'm honored to be leading the very strong team he has built going forward. 
Turning to our results. We completed the quarter in an excellent financial position and continue to build upon our balance sheet strength. We have over $75 billion in capital and a AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets that now exceeds $123 billion. Our record underwriting and investment performance produced strong positive operating cash flow of $3.1 billion for the quarter.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $352 million in dividends. Through the 6 months ended June 30, we returned $3.1 billion, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends of $704 million. We recently announced a onetime incremental share repurchase program of up to $5 billion through June 2022.
As Evan said, adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was a record $945 million, higher than our estimated range, benefiting from increased corporate bond call activity and higher private equity distributions. We increased the size of our investment portfolio by $2.4 billion in the quarter after buybacks due to strong operating cash flow and high portfolio returns, including $694 million in pretax unrealized gains from falling interest rates. At June 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $3.3 billion after tax.
During this challenging investment return environment, we will remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy and do not expect to materially adjust the portfolio asset allocation over the near term. We will be selective but active, and we'll continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and we will not reach for yields. There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including the amount of operating cash flow available to invest, the reinvestment rate environment and the assumed prepayment speeds on our corporate bond calls and variability around private equity distributions. Based on the current interest rate environment and a normalized long calls in private equity distributions, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 11.5% and 17.7%, respectively, for the quarter. And as a reminder, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter of $712 million after tax, we have increased core operating ROE by 5 percentage points to 16.5% and core operating income by $1.59 per share to $5.21. Book and tangible book value per share increased by 4.2% and 5%, respectively, from the first quarter.
Due to record core operating income and realized and unrealized gains of $1.4 billion after tax in our investment portfolio, which again primarily came from declining rates and mark-to-market gains on private equities. The increase in book value per share also reflects the impact of returning over $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter. 
Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $280 million, principally from severe U.S. weather-related events. There was no overall change to our aggregate COVID-19 loss estimate. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $268 million. This included a charge from molestation claims of $68 million pretax compared with $259 million in the prior year. Excluding this charge, we had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $336 million pretax, split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 70% short-tail lines.
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion in constant dollars and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 80%. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.8% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

We're exceeding loss costs right now by a reasonable margin. And the industry overall -- forget Chubb, the industry overall has been, number one, achieving loss rates in excess of loss costs for just 2 years now. And secondly, the industry starts at a loss ratio that is quite high. And to achieve a reasonable risk-adjusted return, it has to continue to achieve rate in excess of loss cost for a prolonged period of time.
Interest rates are so low, there's no joy on the other side. And then you have an external environment that is -- that has risk around it, from cyber, to climate, to the litigation environment. And all that is baked into, I think, the mood and the thinking among those in the industry underwriting today. And so in my judgment, from everything I see, it is natural that I gave you year-on-year movement in pricing and rate so that you would have a perspective. And as you think about the rate of increase declining going forward, that is natural, but it's well in excess of loss cost and I believe that will continue.

But we think that's a head fake on a timing question in how we imagine trend and therefore, what you really need in pricing.
On the short tail side of the business, I really gave you 2 numbers. I gave you homeowners. And I gave the homeowners running a double-digit observed inflation today. I gave you a long tail -- I gave you short-tail commercial that were trending at 4%. 
On the commercial part side, from all we see and all of our data, currently at the moment, it's actually running below that, both frequency and severity.

That is not addressing by itself, the fundamental issue that the industry has to wrestle. And Chubb is beginning to respond to, but others are slow to react to that are the fundamentals around cyber.
Like pandemic, cyber has a catastrophe profile to it and the nature of cat potential that has no time nor geographic boundary to it. And you take the growing digital interconnection of the world today in everything, personal and business, and that potential for catastrophe, the concentrations of exposure are only growing.
And you see the spector of risk raising its head and all the cyber attacks we see, malicious cyber attacks, both nation state and nonnation-state actors for various reasons: one, to disrupt society, another, to make money. And so you have a frequency of loss on one hand and rate -- and some adjustment to coverage can manage that.
On the other side of the coin, you have a systemic nature of this. And I can tell you, in the way Chubb underwrites, we are facing it and we are beginning to address it. And then on the -- in underwriting. And now on the other side are the real public policy questions, and we are involved in raising our voice in the public policy arena.
Number one, when you look at ransomware, while I don't think the government should outlaw ransom, where payments at this time, I do think that we ought to be looking at whether we allow payments. I do think the nature -- because who are you paying? Terrorists? 
Secondly, treasury right now, you should require -- you should be obligated under current law, anti-money laundering laws, to get permission to make a ransomware payment. We should be removing the incentive out of the system for ransomware attacks, which are all about money for the most part. And on mask what is the social or the intention to disrupt our country politically and unmask that part of it and show it.
Secondly, there are all kinds of things that the private sector and public sector could be doing together. Sharing of information is one of them right now and understanding where systemic risk aggregations are is another. So I'll stop right there, but it is more than about achieving rate in cyber today. 
Sorry, Brian, more than you expected, but we have clear views about this."

As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by record operating earnings and underwriting results, expanded margins and double-digit premium revenue growth globally, the best in over 15 years, powered by commercial P&C and supported by continued robust commercial P&C rate movement. Chubb was built for these conditions. 
We have averaged double-digit commercial P&C growth over the past 10 quarters. The breadth of our product and reach, combined with our execution-oriented underwriting culture and our reputation for service and consistency enable us to fully capitalize on opportunity globally. And conditions such as these size and scale are our friend. 
Core operating income in the quarter was $1.62 billion or $3.62 per share, again, both records. On both the reported and current accident year ex-cat basis, underwriting results in the quarter were simply world-class. The published P&C combined ratio was 85.5% and current accident year was 85.4% compared to 87.4% prior year. The 2 percentage points of margin improvement were almost entirely loss ratio related. 
Current accident year underwriting income of $1.2 billion was up 27%. While on the other side of the balance sheet, adjusted net investment income of $945 million, also a record, was up nearly 9.5% from prior year. Peter will have more to say about cats and prior period development, investment income and book value. 
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 15.5% globally, with commercial premiums, excluding agriculture, up nearly 21%. The 15.5% growth for the quarter and 12.6% for the first 6 months were the strongest growth we have seen since 2004. Growth in the quarter was extremely broad-based, with contributions from virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally, from those serving large companies, to midsized and small and most regions of the world and distribution channels. 
We continue to experience a needed and robust commercial P&C pricing environment in most all important regions of the world, with continued year-on-year improvement in rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal. Based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will continue. 
In North America, Commercial P&C net premiums grew over 16%. New business was up 24%, and renewal retention remained strong at 96.5% on a premium basis. In our North America major accounts and specialty commercial business, net premiums grew over 13%, with each division, major accounts, Westchester and Bermuda having its largest quarter in history in terms of written business. And the standout was our middle market and small commercial division, which had the biggest quarter in about 20 years, driven by record new business growth and strong retentions. 
Overall rates increased in North America commercial by a strong 13.5%, which is on top of a 14.7% rate increase last year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increase over 30%. And remember, in North America, rates have been rising for almost 4 years. However, they have exceeded loss costs for only about 2 years now. Loss costs are currently trending about 5.5% and vary up or down depending upon line of business. General commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%. 
Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement by division and line in North America. In major accounts, rates increased in the quarter by about 16% on top of almost 18% prior year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increase over 36%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up almost 9%. General casualty rates were up 21% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 12% and financial lines rates were up almost 20%. 
In our E&S wholesale business, the cumulative 2-year rate increase was 39%, comprised of an increase of circa 18% this quarter on top of 18% prior year second quarter. Property rates were up about 16.5%. Casualty was up about 21%, and financial lines rates were up over 21%. 
In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter over 9.5% on top of over 9% last year, making the 2-year cumulative increase 20%. Rates for property were up over 10.5%. Casualty rates were up 11%, excluding workers' comp, and comp rates were down at about 0.5%. Financial Lines rates were up over 17.5% in our middle market business. 
Turning to our international general insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew an astonishing 33% on a published basis or 24% in constant dollars. International retail commercial grew 27% and our London wholesale business grew 60%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region, with premiums up 36.5% in our European division, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the continent. Asia Pacific was up over 29%, while our Latin America commercial lines business grew over 14.5%. 
Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail commercial P&C business, the 2-year cumulative rate increase was 35% comprised of increases this quarter and prior year of 16% each. 
Two territories in particular, the U.K. and Australia, stand out in terms of rate achievement. In our U.K. business, rates increased in the quarter by 18%, on top of a 26% rate increase prior year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increase 48%. 
In Australia, the 2-year cumulative rate was 42%, comprised of an increase of 23% this quarter, on top of 16% prior year. In our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 13%, on top of a 20% rate increase prior year, so making the 2-year cumulative 36%. 
International markets began firming later than the U.S. And again, like with the U.S., rates has exceeded loss costs for about 2 years now. Outside the U.S., loss costs are currently trending 3%, so that varies by class of business and country. 
Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. Our international consumer business grew 13% in the quarter, and that's on a published basis. It grew 5% in constant dollars. Breaking that down for you, international personal lines grew 20% on a published basis, while our international A&H grew 6.5%, but it was essentially flat in constant dollar. 
Within our A&H book, a nascent recovery in our leisure travel business outside of Asia is beginning to result in growth, although passenger travel activity is still well below pre-pandemic levels. In both our group A&H business, with its employer-based benefits and our consumer-focused direct marketing business, premiums were up mid-single digits, still impacted by the pandemic but beginning to improve. 
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up over 2.5%. Nonrenewals in California and COVID auto-related renewal credits had almost 1 point of negative impact on growth in the quarter. Our [indiscernible] network client segment, the heart of our business, grew almost 8% in the quarter. 
Overall retention remains strong at over 94%. And we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 13% in our homeowners portfolio. Loss cost inflation in homeowners is currently running about 11%. Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits, were up 55% in the quarter, while net premiums in our Global Re business grew up -- grew over 32%. 
In sum, we continue to capitalize on a hard or firming market for commercial P&C in most areas of the world. Both growth and margin expansion are 2 trends that I am confident will continue. Our organization is firing on all cylinders. We're growing our business and our exposures, and we continue to expand our margins. Our leadership employees are energized and driven to win. I couldn't be more proud or humbled by the results they are producing, and I want to thank them all publicly for their efforts. I am confident in our ability to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Peter."

First, I'd like to acknowledge Phil Bancroft's almost 20 years of service and leadership with the company. I'm excited to be in my new position and build upon all that he has achieved -- all he has achieved under his leadership, and I'm honored to be leading the very strong team he has built going forward. 
Turning to our results. We completed the quarter in an excellent financial position and continue to build upon our balance sheet strength. We have over $75 billion in capital and a AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets that now exceeds $123 billion. Our record underwriting and investment performance produced strong positive operating cash flow of $3.1 billion for the quarter. 
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $352 million in dividends. Through the 6 months ended June 30, we returned $3.1 billion, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends of $704 million. We recently announced a onetime incremental share repurchase program of up to $5 billion through June 2022. 
As Evan said, adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was a record $945 million, higher than our estimated range, benefiting from increased corporate bond call activity and higher private equity distributions. We increased the size of our investment portfolio by $2.4 billion in the quarter after buybacks due to strong operating cash flow and high portfolio returns, including $694 million in pretax unrealized gains from falling interest rates. At June 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $3.3 billion after tax. 
During this challenging investment return environment, we will remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy and do not expect to materially adjust the portfolio asset allocation over the near term. We will be selective but active, and we'll continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and we will not reach for yields. 
There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including the amount of operating cash flow available to invest, the reinvestment rate environment and the assumed prepayment speeds on our corporate bond calls and variability around private equity distributions. Based on the current interest rate environment and a normalization of bond calls and private equity distributions, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. 
Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 11.5% and 17.7%, respectively, for the quarter. And as a reminder, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter of $712 million after tax, we have increased core operating ROE by 5 percentage points to 16.5% and core operating income by $1.59 per share to $5.21. 
Book and tangible book value per share increased by 4.2% and 5%, respectively, from the first quarter due to record core operating income and realized and unrealized gains of $1.4 billion after tax in our investment portfolio, which again primarily came from declining rates and mark-to-market gains on private equities. The increase in book value per share also reflects the impact of returning over $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter. 
Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $280 million, principally from severe U.S. weather-related events. There was no overall change to our aggregate COVID-19 loss estimate. 
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $268 million. This included a charge from molestation claims of $68 million pretax compared with $259 million in the prior year. Excluding this charge, we had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $336 million pretax, split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 70% short-tail lines. 
For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion in constant dollars and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 80%. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.8% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.

They're exceeding loss costs right now by a reasonable margin. 
And the industry overall -- forget Chubb, the industry overall has been, number one, achieving loss rates in excess of loss costs for just 2 years now. And secondly, the industry starts at a loss ratio that is quite high. And to achieve a reasonable risk-adjusted return, it has to continue to achieve rate in excess of loss cost for a prolonged period of time.
Interest rates are so low, there's no joy on the other side. And then you have an external environment that is -- that has risk around it, from cyber, to climate, to the litigation environment. And all that is baked into, I think, the mood and the thinking among those in the industry underwriting today. 
And so in my judgment, from everything I see, it is natural that I gave you year-on-year movement in pricing and rate so that you would have a perspective. And as you think about the rate of increase declining going forward, that is natural but it's well in excess of loss cost, and I believe that will continue.

So there's -- the actual at the moment is running better than the trended 6% we're using. But we think that's a head fake and a timing question in how we imagine trend and therefore, what you really need in pricing.
On the short-tail side of the business, I really gave you 2 numbers. I gave you homeowners. And I gave the homeowners running a double-digit observed inflation today. I gave you a long-tail -- I gave you a short-tail commercial that we're trending at 4%. 
On the commercial part side, from all we see and all of our data, currently at the moment, it's actually running below that, both frequency and severity. But we see enough of what we see as inflation externally. We see enough of what we see in the homeowners book that we continue to trend it in both pricing and reserving at that 4% range."

Imagine that on Chubb's balance sheet, I can take $10 million net per risk on a given class of business. But imagine that in all the countries we do business in around the world, I can't take that kind of retention because of my limited amount of capital. If I tried to take it in each jurisdiction and I had a loss in Malaysia or I had a loss in XYZ country, I'd have to be dividending out of one place, contributing capital in another. It's the most inefficient way to run a business. 
So the pooling of risk and internal reinsurance is what allows you to leverage a global balance sheet to the benefit of local operations and it provides in one place the stability of spread of risk against an amount of capital. So that's the fundamental reason that you start with, that Chubb uses internal reinsurance. Thanks for the question, Tracy."

Look, the pricing environment is pretty good. The -- but that's not it. That is not addressing, by itself, the fundamental issue that the industry has to wrestle and Chubb is beginning to respond to, but others are slow to react to, that are the fundamentals around cyber.
Like pandemic, cyber has a catastrophe profile to it and the nature of cat potential that has no time nor geographic boundary to it. And you take the growing digital interconnection of the world today in everything, personal and business, and that potential for catastrophe, the concentrations of exposure are only growing.
And you see the spectre of risk raising its head in all the cyberattacks we see, malicious cyberattacks, both nation state and non-nation-state actors for various reasons: one, to disrupt society; another, to make money. And so you have a frequency of loss on one hand and rate -- and some adjustment to coverage can manage that.
On the other side of the coin, you have a systemic nature of this. And I can tell you, in the way Chubb underwrites, we are facing it and we are beginning to address it. And then on the -- in underwriting. And then on the other side are the real public policy questions, and we are involved in raising our voice in the public policy arena.
Number one, when you look at ransomware. While I don't think the government should outlaw ransom, where payments at this time, I do think that we ought to be looking at whether we allow crypto payments. I do think the nature -- because who are you paying? Terrorists? 
Secondly, treasury right now. You should require -- you should be obligated under current laws, anti-money laundering laws to get permission to make a ransomware payment. We should be removing the incentive out of the system for ransomware attacks, which are all about money for the most part. And unmask what is the social or the intention to disrupt our country politically and unmask that part of it and show it.
Secondly, there are all kinds of things that the private sector and public sector could be doing together. Sharing of information is one of them right now and understanding where systemic risk aggregations are is another. So I'll stop right there, but it is more than about achieving rate in cyber today. 
Sorry, Brian, more than you expected, but we have clear views about this."

We had a very strong third quarter, highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current accident year basis despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our",1587,"Good morning. We had a very strong third quarter, highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current accident year basis despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our results were powered by double-digit commercial lines growth, strong continued underlying margin expansion, the strength of our reserves and our broad diversification of businesses. 
Core operating income in the quarter of $2.64 per share was up 32% or $250 million over prior year to $1.2 billion, while net income of $1.8 billion was up 53% from prior year. For the year, on both the net and core operating income basis, we have produced record earnings. Again, it was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, yet with over $1.1 billion of cats, we reported a 93.4% combined ratio, with P&C underwriting income up 58% to $617 million, which speaks to the underlying strength of our businesses and, again, broad diversification of our company's sources of revenue and earnings, both domestically and globally. 
Year-to-date, we have produced $2.4 billion in underwriting income for a combined ratio of 90.4%, and that includes $2.1 billion of cat losses in what is shaping up to be another year of sizable weather-related loss events, kind of the new normal, brought on by climate change and other societal changes. 
Speaking again to our underwriting health. On a current accident year ex cat basis, underwriting income in the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 23%, with a combined ratio of 84.8% compared to 85.7% prior year, a quarterly underwriting record. If we exclude the onetime positive adjustment we took last year due to lower frequency of loss because of the COVID-related shutdown, our current accident year combined ratio unaffected improved 2 points. This is more reflective of our margin expansion, and we included a simple exhibit in our press release showing the detail. 
The strength of our balance sheet and conservative approach to loss reserving was again in evidence this quarter as we reported $321 million in favorable prior period reserve development. Net investment income in the quarter was $940 million, up 4.5%. Peter is going to have more to say about cats and prior period development, investment income and book value. 
Turning to growth in the rate environment. As I said at the opening, P&C premiums were up nearly 17% globally or 15.5% in constant dollar, with commercial premiums up 22% and consumer up 4%. The 17% growth for the quarter and 14.2% for the first 9 months topped last quarter and was the strongest organic growth we have seen again since 2004. Growth in the quarter was broad-based with contributions of virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally from our agriculture business to those serving large companies to midsized and small and most regions of the world and distribution channels. The robust commercial P&C pricing environment remains on pace in most all important regions of the world, with continued year-on-year improvement and rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal. 
In North America, total P&C net premiums grew over 17%, with commercial premium up about 22.5%. Excluding agriculture, which had a fantastic quarter in its own right, with premium growth of over 40%, commercial P&C premiums were up over 16.5% in North America. New business was up 13% for all commercial lines, and renewal retention remained strong at over 97% on a premium basis. The 16.5% commercial premium growth is a composite of 15.5% growth in our major accounts and specialty business and over 18% in our middle market and small commercial business, simply a standout quarter for this division. Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines by over 12%. Once again, loss costs are currently trending about 5.5%. It can vary up or down depending upon line of business. And again, like last quarter, just to remind you, in general, commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, though we anticipate this to increase in the future, while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%. 
Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement in North America. In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased in the quarter by just over 13%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up over 6%. General casualty rates were up about 21% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up 12%, and financial lines rates were up 17%. 
In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by 16% in the quarter. Property rates were up 13%, casualty was up 20%, and financial lines rates were up about 21%. In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter nearly 9.5%. Rates for property were up over 11%. Casualty rates were up about 9.5%, excluding workers' comp, with comp rates down 2%. And financial lines rates were up 18%. 
Turning to our international general insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew 20.5% on a published basis or 16% in constant dollar. International retail commercial P&C grew nearly 17% or 12% in constant dollar, while our London wholesale business grew over 31%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region, with premiums up almost 28% in our European division, Asia Pacific was up 15.5%, while Latin America commercial lines grew about 6.5%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. 
In our international retail commercial P&C business, rates increased in the quarter by 15%. Property rates were up 11%, financial lines up 33%, and primary and excess casualty up 7% and 11%, respectively. And in our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 11%, property up 13%, financial lines up 14%, marine up 8%. 
Outside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 3%, but that varies by class of business and country. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's ongoing effects on consumer-related activities. Our international consumer business grew almost 10% in the quarter on a published basis or 5% in constant dollar. And breaking that down a little further, International Personal Lines grew almost 11% on a published basis, while international A&H grew over 8.5% or just 5% in constant dollar. Latin America had a particularly strong quarter in consumer, with personal lines and A&H premiums up 18.5% and 17.5%, respectively, powered by both our traditional and digitally focused distribution relationships. 
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up just over 1%. Adjusted for nonrenewals in California and COVID-related auto renewal credits, we grew 3% in the quarter. Our true high net worth client segment, the heart of our business, grew 11% in the quarter. Overall retentions remained strong at 95.7%, and we achieved positive pricing which includes rate and exposure of 14% in our homeowners portfolio. The severity trends in personal lines in the U.S. remain elevated. 
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 52% in the quarter, while net premiums in our global re business were up over 22%. In sum, we continue to capitalize on broad-based and favorable market conditions and improving economic conditions. All of our businesses did well or are improving, from agriculture to all forms of commercial P&C globally, both retail and wholesale, serving large companies to middle market and small, to our improving global personal lines and A&H businesses, to our Asia life businesses, to our global re business. In one sentence, both growth and margin expansion are 2 trends that will continue. 
In the quarter, as you saw, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire life and non-life insurance companies that house the personal accident, supplemental health and life insurance businesses of Cigna in Asia Pacific for $5.75 billion in cash. As you saw or can see from our investor presentation, these operations generate approximately $3 billion in premium revenue, have favorable underwriting margins and are not exposed to the P&C cycle. This highly complementary transaction advances our strategy to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, including our company's Asia-based life company presence, and adds significantly to our already sizable global A&H business. Upon completion of the transaction, which we expect during 2022, Asia Pacific share of Chubb's global portfolio will represent approximately 20% of the company. For many years, we have admired Cigna's business in Asia, including its people, product innovation, distribution and management capabilities. The underlying economics and value creation of the transaction are very attractive. And these businesses will contribute to our company strategically for decades to come. The transaction once again demonstrates our patience in advancing our strategies and confirms our consistent and disciplined approach to holding capital for risk and growth, both organic and inorganic. Our company has considerable learning power and a patient hand to deploy capital effectively over time. We return excess of what we need to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while we continue to build future revenue and earnings generation capabilities. 
In conclusion, this was another excellent quarter of growing our business and our exposures, expanding our margins and investing in our future, all in a period with substantial cats, which are not unexpected. My management team and I have never been more confident in our ability to continue to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Peter and then will be back to take your questions."

As you've just heard from Evan, our overall franchise continues to deliver outstanding top line growth, margin improvement and profit growth. 
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital management. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong, including our cash flow, liquidity, investment portfolio, reserves and capital. It all starts with our operating performance, which produced $3.3 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter and $8.5 billion for the first 9 months. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter, even after our significant capital management actions. 
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $346 million in dividends. Through the 9 months ended September 30, we returned over $5 billion, including almost $4 billion in share repurchases or over 5% of our outstanding shares and dividends of over $1 billion. The agreement to acquire Cigna's A&H and life insurance businesses in Asia Pacific is not expected to impact our share repurchase and dividend commitments. 
Our investment portfolio of $122 billion continues to be of a very high quality, and we have not made any material changes during the quarter to our investment allocation. The portfolio increased $759 million in the quarter. And at September 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $2.9 billion after tax. Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $940 million, similar to last quarter and $40 million higher than our estimated range, benefiting from higher private equity distributions. As I noted on the second quarter earnings call, our investment income is based on many factors. And notwithstanding our better-than-expected results over the last few quarters, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. 
Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, with about $1 billion in the U.S., of which $806 million was from Hurricane Ida and $135 million from international events, of which $95 million was from flood losses in Europe. Our reserve position remained strong with net reserves increasing $1.7 billion or 3.2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter and 2021 growth, in particular, from our agricultural business, which has a seasonality impact on reserves. We had favorable prior period development of $321 million pretax, which includes $33 million of adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures. The remaining favorable development of $354 million was split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 70% in short-tail lines, principally from our 2020 North American personal lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 73% or a very strong 75% after adjusting for cats, PPD and agriculture. Book value decreased by $744 million or [ 1.5% ], reflecting $1.16 billion in core operating income and a net gain on our investment portfolio of $190 million, which was more than offset by foreign exchange losses of $305 million and the $1.9 billion of share repurchases and dividends. Book and tangible book value per share increased 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, from last quarter. 
Our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date was 12.3% and 14.4%, respectively. Our core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.6%, respectively, for the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include the fair value mark on our private equity funds and core operating income as many of our peer companies do. For comparison purposes, our core operating ROE increases by 5 percentage points to 13.2 and our core operating income increases by $1.61 per share to $4.25. Year-to-date, our core operating ROE, including the fair value mark on our PE funds, would be 13.8%. 
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

And it's a broader statement that I'm making. And in the press release, it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years a rise in the fr",485,"Yes, I'm going to answer it a little differently than that. And it's a broader statement that I'm making. And in the press release, it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years a rise in the frequency and severity of insured losses globally from commercial and personal property arising from nat cat and especially losses from less well-modeled or nonmodeled clauses. Our objective with all of this is twofold: price business adequately to pay for the risk; secondly, understand and manage accumulation of exposures against weather-related pearls, modeled and non or less well modeled. 
Factors that are contributing to the rise in loss actually fall into 3 categories. First, we're seeing today changes globally in the frequency and severity of the perils such as tropical storms, wildfires and floods. However, the historical record provides some interesting context when thinking about today's risk environment. For example, recent land-falling U.S. hurricane activity is not especially anomalous in either frequency or frequency of intense storms as measured by wind speed compared to, say, the first part of the 20th century. And repeats of storms from this earlier period would, in fact, generate losses far greater than any modern storm in terms of industry loss, all of which is already contemplated in our modeling and risk management. And with all that said, though, there is evidence now that the amount of precipitation contained within the storms appears to be greater, and that is increasing the amount of loss emanating from events. 
The second factor that contributes is changes to the exposure footprint of insurable personal and commercial properties, increases in actual exposure units and values from GDP growth, demographic shifts to higher-risk geographies and aging building stock are all examples of factors that are leading to higher loss potential. 
And finally, the third, the impact of natural events is further amplified by increasingly vulnerable infrastructure. For example, the levy failures during Hurricane Katrina in '05 and the systemic electric grid failure during the 2021 Texas freeze. We're actively working to reflect the impact of all of these trends in our pricing, risk selection and exposure management. We have significant advances in modeling, especially secondary perils such as floods and wildfires, but there's still a way to go. 
Our loss costs consider recent experience, together with explicit recognition of factors that can be quantified such as sea level rise, exposure growth or demographic shifts. And we continue to refine our portfolio management -- our portfolio management to manage risk aggregation at an ever more granular level. The net results for us are dynamically risk-adjusted rates that appropriately reflect changes and charges for both recent loss experience and exposure concentrations. So we're striving to stay on top of this, and we have an awful lot of resources dedicated to the effort. And frankly, I think we're in pretty good shape."

And it's a difficult market for recruiting, and retention rates are modestly lower. And it's a combination of people moving around and more retirements and just making different choices in their lives, an outcome, clearly, of COVID in many ways. We have to manage. We've significantly beefed up and improved our resource capabilities around recruiting. And we have such an intense focus on it. 
And the -- in aggregate, the number of open positions we had and workers down today than it was then. We're making progress, but you have to grind on it. People want [indiscernible] a different way to work. They want more flexibility in the days that they work or the hours that they work. And while we remain a work-from-office company and will be, we have adjusted and recognized that, given the ability with technology today, that has been proven over the -- and it's accelerated and improving at that over the last 1.5 years since we went into shutdown or closer to 2 years now -- or I guess about 1.5 years. The -- our ability to productively work, not simply from the office, but from home, allows for greater flexibility, and we recognize that and, therefore, are adjusting our own expectations around that. So we're mindful, obviously, that we're in a marketplace that competes for talent. We want the best and the brightest and those -- and the most ambitious, I should say, really the most ambitious, to want to work for Chubb. We are an ambitious company. We're not going to moderate our goals and our objectives because of employment concerns. We're going to just step up our game to make sure we're a place where those who share our ambition and want to work hard, on a different kind of work-life balance and where they work from, we want them to work here. And we want them to be motivated to be here. And so we're making strides in that, I think, good strides. And as I said, the overall number of open positions here is down and down not a small amount."

We had a very strong third quarter, highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current accident year basis despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our",1587,"Good morning. We had a very strong third quarter, highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current accident year basis despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our results were powered by double-digit commercial lines growth, strong continued underlying margin expansion, the strength of our reserves and our broad diversification of businesses.
Core operating income in the quarter of $2.64 per share was up 32% or $250 million over prior year to $1.2 billion, while net income of $1.8 billion was up 53% from prior year. For the year, on both the net and core operating income basis, we have produced record earnings. Again, it was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, yet with over $1.1 billion of cats, we reported a 93.4% combined ratio with P&C underwriting income up 58% to $617 million, which speaks to the underlying strength of our businesses and, again, broad diversification of our company's sources of revenue and earnings, both domestically and globally.
Year-to-date, we have produced $2.4 billion in underwriting income for a combined ratio of 90.4%, and that includes $2.1 billion of cat losses in what is shaping up to be another year of sizable weather-related loss events, kind of the new normal, brought on by climate change and other societal changes.
Speaking again to our underwriting health. On a current accident year ex cat basis, underwriting income in the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 23% with a combined ratio of 84.8% compared to 85.7% prior year, a quarterly underwriting record. If we exclude the onetime positive adjustment we took last year due to lower frequency of loss because of the COVID-related shutdown, our current accident year combined ratio unaffected improved 2 points. This is more reflective of our margin expansion, and we included a simple exhibit in our press release showing the detail.
The strength of our balance sheet and conservative approach to loss reserving was again in evidence this quarter as we reported $321 million in favorable prior period reserve development. Net investment income in the quarter was $940 million, up 4.5%. Peter is going to have more to say about cats and prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth in the rate environment. As I said at the opening, P&C premiums were up nearly 17% globally or 15.5% in constant dollar, with commercial premiums up 22% and consumer up 4%. The 17% growth for the quarter and 14.2% for the first 9 months topped last quarters and was the strongest organic growth we have seen again since 2004. 
Growth in the quarter was broad-based with contributions of virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally from our agriculture business to those serving large companies to midsized and small and most regions of the world and distribution channels. The robust commercial P&C pricing environment remains on pace in most all important regions of the world with continued year-on-year improvement and rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal.
In North America, total P&C net premiums grew over 17% with commercial premium up about 22.5%. Excluding agriculture, which had a fantastic quarter in its own right with premium growth of over 40%, commercial P&C premiums were up over 16.5% in North America. 
New business was up 13% for all commercial lines, and renewal retention remained strong at over 97% on a premium basis. The 16.5% commercial premium growth is a composite of 15.5% growth in our major accounts and specialty business and over 18% in our middle market and small commercial business, simply a standout quarter for this division. 
Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines by over 12%. Once again, loss costs are currently trending about 5.5%. It can vary up or down, depending upon line of business. And again, like last quarter, just to remind you, in general, commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, though we anticipate this to increase in the future while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement in North America. In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased in the quarter by just over 13%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up over 6%. General casualty rates were up about 21% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up 12%, and financial lines rates were up 17%.
In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by 16% in the quarter. Property rates were up 13%. Casualty was up 20%. And financial lines rates were up about 21%. In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter nearly 9.5%. Rates for property were up over 11%. Casualty rates were up about 9.5%, excluding workers' comp, with comp rates down 2%. And financial lines rates were up 18%.
Turning to our international general insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew 20.5% on a published basis or 16% in constant dollar. International retail commercial P&C grew nearly 17% or 12% in constant dollar, while our London wholesale business grew over 31%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region with premiums up almost 28% in our European division, Asia Pacific was up 15.5% while Latin America commercial lines grew about 6.5%. 
Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail commercial P&C business, rates increased in the quarter by 15%; property rates were up 11%; financial lines, up 33%; and primary and excess casualty, up 7% and 11%, respectively. And in our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 11%; property, up 13%, financial; lines, up 14%; marine, up 8%.
Outside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 3%. So that varies by class of business and country. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's ongoing effects on consumer-related activities. Our international consumer business grew almost 10% in the quarter on a published basis or 5% in constant dollar. And breaking that down a little further, international personal lines grew almost 11% on a published basis while international A&H grew over 8.5% or just 5% in constant dollar. Latin America had a particularly strong quarter in consumer, with personal lines and A&H premiums up 18.5% and 17.5%, respectively, powered by both our traditional and digitally focused distribution relationships.
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up just over 1%. Adjusted for nonrenewals in California and COVID-related auto renewal credits, we grew 3% in the quarter. Our true high net worth client segment, the heart of our business, grew 11% in the quarter. Overall retentions remained strong at 95.7%, and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 14% in our homeowners portfolio. The severity trends in personal lines in the U.S. remain elevated.
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 52% in the quarter while net premiums in our global re business were up over 22%. In sum, we continue to capitalize on broad-based and favorable market conditions and improving economic conditions. All of our businesses did well or are improving from agriculture to all forms of commercial P&C globally, both retail and wholesale, serving large companies to middle market and small, to our improving global personal lines and A&H businesses, to our Asia life businesses, to our global re business. In one sentence, both growth and margin expansion are 2 trends that will continue.
In the quarter, as you saw, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire life and non-life insurance companies that house the personal accident, supplemental health and life insurance businesses of Cigna in Asia Pacific for $5.75 billion in cash. 
As you saw or can see from our investor presentation, these operations generate approximately $3 billion in premium revenue, have favorable underwriting margins and are not exposed to the P&C cycle. This highly complementary transaction advances our strategy to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, including our company's Asia-based life company presence, and adds significantly to our already sizable global A&H business. Upon completion of the transaction, which we expect during 2022, Asia Pacific share of Chubb's global portfolio will represent approximately 20% of the company. 
For many years, we have admired Cigna's business in Asia, including its people, product innovation, distribution and management capabilities. The underlying economics and value creation of the transaction are very attractive, and these businesses will contribute to our company strategically for decades to come. 
The transaction once again demonstrates our patience in advancing our strategies and confirms our consistent and disciplined approach to holding capital for risk and growth, both organic and inorganic. Our company has considerable learning power and a patient hand to deploy capital effectively over time. We return excess of what we need to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while we continue to build future revenue and earnings generation capabilities.
In conclusion, this was another excellent quarter of growing our business and our exposures, expanding our margins and investing in our future, all in a period with substantial cats, which are not unexpected. My management team and I have never been more confident in our ability to continue to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Peter and then will be back to take your questions."

As you've just heard from Evan, our overall franchise continues to deliver outstanding top line growth, margin improvement and profit growth.Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital management.",642,"Thank you, Evan, and good morning again, everyone. As you've just heard from Evan, our overall franchise continues to deliver outstanding top line growth, margin improvement and profit growth.
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital management. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong, including our cash flow, liquidity, investment portfolio, reserves and capital. It all starts with our operating performance, which produced $3.3 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter and $8.5 billion for the first 9 months. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter, even after our significant capital management actions.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $346 million in dividends. Through the 9 months ended September 30, we returned over $5 billion, including almost $4 billion in share repurchases or over 5% of our outstanding shares and dividends of over $1 billion. The agreement to acquire Cigna's A&H and life insurance businesses in Asia Pacific is not expected to impact our share repurchase and dividend commitments.
Our investment portfolio of $122 billion continues to be of a very high quality, and we have not made any material changes during the quarter to our investment allocation. The portfolio increased $759 million in the quarter. And at September 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $2.9 billion after tax. 
Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $940 million, similar to last quarter and $40 million higher than our estimated range, benefiting from higher private equity distributions. As I noted on the second quarter earnings call, our investment income is based on many factors. And notwithstanding our better-than-expected results over the last few quarters, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, with about $1 billion in the U.S., of which $806 million was from Hurricane Ida and $135 million from international events, of which $95 million was from flood losses in Europe. Our reserve position remained strong with net reserves increasing $1.7 billion or 3.2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter and 2021 growth, in particular, from our agricultural business, which has a seasonality impact on reserves. 
We had favorable prior period development of $321 million pretax, which includes $33 million of adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures. The remaining favorable development of $354 million was split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 70% in short-tail lines, principally from our 2020 North American personal lines. 
Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 73% or a very strong 75% after adjusting for cats, PPD and agriculture. Book value decreased by $744 million or [ 1.5% ], reflecting $1.16 billion in core operating income and a net gain on our investment portfolio of $190 million, which was more than offset by foreign exchange losses of $305 million and the $1.9 billion of share repurchases and dividends. Book and tangible book value per share increased 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, from last quarter.
Our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date was 12.3% and 14.4%, respectively. Our core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.6%, respectively, for the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include the fair value mark on our private equity funds and core operating income as many of our peer companies do. For comparison purposes, our core operating ROE increases by 5 percentage points to 13.2% and our core operating income increases by $1.61 per share to $4.25. Year-to-date, our core operating ROE, including the fair value mark on our PE funds, would be 13.8%.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

I'm going to answer it a little differently than that, and it's a broader statement that I'm making. And in the press release, it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years a rise in the fr",486,"Yes. I'm going to answer it a little differently than that, and it's a broader statement that I'm making. And in the press release, it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years a rise in the frequency and severity of insured losses globally from commercial and personal property arising from nat cat and especially losses from less well-modeled or non-modeled clauses. Our objective with all of this is twofold: price business adequately to pay for the risk; secondly, understand and manage accumulation of exposures against weather-related perils, modeled and non or less well modeled. 
Factors that are contributing to the rise in loss actually fall into 3 categories. First, we're seeing today changes globally in the frequency and severity of the perils such as tropical storms, wildfires and floods. However, the historical record provides some interesting context when thinking about today's risk environment. For example, recent land-falling U.S. hurricane activity is not especially anomalous in either frequency or frequency of intense storms as measured by wind speed compared to, say, the first part of the 20th century. And repeats of storms from this earlier period would, in fact, generate losses far greater than any modern storm in terms of industry loss, all of which is already contemplated in our modeling and risk management. And with all that said, though, there is evidence now that the amount of precipitation contained within the storms appears to be greater, and that is increasing the amount of loss emanating from events.
The second factor that contributes is changes to the exposure footprint of insurable personal and commercial properties, increases in actual exposure units and values from GDP growth, demographic shifts to higher risk geographies and aging building stock are all examples of factors that are leading to higher loss potential.
And finally, the third, the impact of natural events is further amplified by increasingly vulnerable infrastructure. For example, the levy failures during Hurricane Katrina in '05 and the systemic electric grid failure during the 2021 Texas freeze. We're actively working to reflect the impact of all of these trends in our pricing, risk selection and exposure management. We have significant advances in modeling, especially secondary perils such as floods and wildfires, but there's still a way to go.
Our loss costs consider recent experience, together with explicit recognition of factors that can be quantified such as sea level rise, exposure growth or demographic shifts. And we continue to refine our portfolio management -- our portfolio management to manage risk aggregation at an ever more granular level. The net results for us are dynamically risk-adjusted rates that appropriately reflect changes and charges for both recent loss experience and exposure concentrations. So we're striving to stay on top of this, and we have an awful lot of resources dedicated to the effort. And frankly, I think we're in pretty good shape."

We have -- to manage, we've significantly beefed up and improved our resource capabilities around recruiting. And we have such an intense focus on it. And the -- in aggregate, the number of open positions we had in June in North America is down today from what it was then. We're making progress and continue to make progress. But you have to grind on it.
People want -- many people want different -- a different way to work. They want more flexibility in the days that they work or the hours that they work. And while we remain a work-from-office company and will be, we have adjusted and recognized that, given the ability with technology today, that has been proven over the -- and it's accelerated, improving of that over the last 1.5 years since we went into shutdown or closer to 2 years now or I guess about 1.5 years. 
The -- our ability to productively work, not simply from the office, but from home, allows for greater flexibility. And we recognize that, and therefore, are adjusting our own expectations around that. So we're mindful, obviously, that we're in a marketplace that competes for talent. We want the best and the brightest and those -- and the most ambitious, I should say, really the most ambitious, to want to work for Chubb. We are an ambitious company. We're not going to moderate our goals and our objectives. Because of employment concerns, we're going to adjust, step up our game to make sure we're a place where those who share our ambition and want to work hard.

And we have to rationally recognize that and address that as part of a 1.2 -- a $1 trillion infrastructure package if we're to spend it and make the difference we expect. And the insurance industry will be a beneficiary of that because those projects need to be insured, both construction and surety."

We had a very strong third quarter, highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current accident year basis despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our",1587,"Good morning. We had a very strong third quarter, highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current accident year basis despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our results were powered by double-digit commercial lines growth, strong continued underlying margin expansion, the strength of our reserves and our broad diversification of businesses.
Core operating income in the quarter of $2.64 per share was up 32% or $250 million over prior year to $1.2 billion, while net income of $1.8 billion was up 53% from prior year. For the year, on both the net and core operating income basis, we have produced record earnings. Again, it was an active quarter for natural catastrophes, yet with over $1.1 billion of cats, we reported a 93.4% combined ratio with P&C underwriting income up 58% to $617 million, which speaks to the underlying strength of our businesses and, again, broad diversification of our company's sources of revenue and earnings, both domestically and globally.
Year-to-date, we have produced $2.4 billion in underwriting income for a combined ratio of 90.4%, and that includes $2.1 billion of cat losses in what is shaping up to be another year of sizable weather-related loss events, kind of the new normal, brought on by climate change and other societal changes.
Speaking again to our underwriting health. On a current accident year ex cat basis, underwriting income in the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 23% with a combined ratio of 84.8% compared to 85.7% prior year, a quarterly underwriting record. If we exclude the onetime positive adjustment we took last year due to lower frequency of loss because of the COVID-related shutdown, our current accident year combined ratio unaffected improved 2 points. This is more reflective of our margin expansion, and we included a simple exhibit in our press release showing the detail.
The strength of our balance sheet and conservative approach to loss reserving was again in evidence this quarter as we reported $321 million in favorable prior period reserve development. Net investment income in the quarter was $940 million, up 4.5%. Peter is going to have more to say about cats and prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth in the rate environment. As I said at the opening, P&C premiums were up nearly 17% globally or 15.5% in constant dollar, with commercial premiums up 22% and consumer up 4%. The 17% growth for the quarter and 14.2% for the first 9 months topped last quarters and was the strongest organic growth we have seen again since 2004. 
Growth in the quarter was broad-based with contributions of virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally from our agriculture business to those serving large companies to midsized and small and most regions of the world and distribution channels. The robust commercial P&C pricing environment remains on pace in most all important regions of the world with continued year-on-year improvement and rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal.
In North America, total P&C net premiums grew over 17% with commercial premium up about 22.5%. Excluding agriculture, which had a fantastic quarter in its own right with premium growth of over 40%, commercial P&C premiums were up over 16.5% in North America. 
New business was up 13% for all commercial lines, and renewal retention remained strong at over 97% on a premium basis. The 16.5% commercial premium growth is a composite of 15.5% growth in our major accounts and specialty business and over 18% in our middle market and small commercial business, simply a standout quarter for this division. 
Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines by over 12%. Once again, loss costs are currently trending about 5.5%. It can vary up or down, depending upon line of business. And again, like last quarter, just to remind you, in general, commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, though we anticipate this to increase in the future while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement in North America. In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased in the quarter by just over 13%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up over 6%. General casualty rates were up about 21% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up 12%, and financial lines rates were up 17%.
In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by 16% in the quarter. Property rates were up 13%. Casualty was up 20%. And financial lines rates were up about 21%. In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter nearly 9.5%. Rates for property were up over 11%. Casualty rates were up about 9.5%, excluding workers' comp, with comp rates down 2%. And financial lines rates were up 18%.
Turning to our international general insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew 20.5% on a published basis or 16% in constant dollar. International retail commercial P&C grew nearly 17% or 12% in constant dollar, while our London wholesale business grew over 31%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region with premiums up almost 28% in our European division, Asia Pacific was up 15.5% while Latin America commercial lines grew about 6.5%. 
Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail commercial P&C business, rates increased in the quarter by 15%; property rates were up 11%; financial lines, up 33%; and primary and excess casualty, up 7% and 11%, respectively. And in our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 11%; property, up 13%, financial; lines, up 14%; marine, up 8%.
Outside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 3%. So that varies by class of business and country. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's ongoing effects on consumer-related activities. Our international consumer business grew almost 10% in the quarter on a published basis or 5% in constant dollar. And breaking that down a little further, international personal lines grew almost 11% on a published basis while international A&H grew over 8.5% or just 5% in constant dollar. Latin America had a particularly strong quarter in consumer, with personal lines and A&H premiums up 18.5% and 17.5%, respectively, powered by both our traditional and digitally focused distribution relationships.
Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up just over 1%. Adjusted for nonrenewals in California and COVID-related auto renewal credits, we grew 3% in the quarter. Our true high net worth client segment, the heart of our business, grew 11% in the quarter. Overall retentions remained strong at 95.7%, and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 14% in our homeowners portfolio. The severity trends in personal lines in the U.S. remain elevated.
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 52% in the quarter while net premiums in our global re business were up over 22%. In sum, we continue to capitalize on broad-based and favorable market conditions and improving economic conditions. All of our businesses did well or are improving from agriculture to all forms of commercial P&C globally, both retail and wholesale, serving large companies to middle market and small, to our improving global personal lines and A&H businesses, to our Asia life businesses, to our global re business. In one sentence, both growth and margin expansion are 2 trends that will continue.
In the quarter, as you saw, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire life and non-life insurance companies that house the personal accident, supplemental health and life insurance businesses of Cigna in Asia Pacific for $5.75 billion in cash. 
As you saw or can see from our investor presentation, these operations generate approximately $3 billion in premium revenue, have favorable underwriting margins and are not exposed to the P&C cycle. This highly complementary transaction advances our strategy to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, including our company's Asia-based life company presence, and adds significantly to our already sizable global A&H business. Upon completion of the transaction, which we expect during 2022, Asia Pacific share of Chubb's global portfolio will represent approximately 20% of the company. 
For many years, we have admired Cigna's business in Asia, including its people, product innovation, distribution and management capabilities. The underlying economics and value creation of the transaction are very attractive, and these businesses will contribute to our company strategically for decades to come. 
The transaction once again demonstrates our patience in advancing our strategies and confirms our consistent and disciplined approach to holding capital for risk and growth, both organic and inorganic. Our company has considerable learning power and a patient hand to deploy capital effectively over time. We return excess of what we need to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while we continue to build future revenue and earnings generation capabilities.
In conclusion, this was another excellent quarter of growing our business and our exposures, expanding our margins and investing in our future, all in a period with substantial cats, which are not unexpected. My management team and I have never been more confident in our ability to continue to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Peter and then will be back to take your questions."

As you've just heard from Evan, our overall franchise continues to deliver outstanding top line growth, margin improvement and profit growth.Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital management.",642,"Thank you, Evan, and good morning again, everyone. As you've just heard from Evan, our overall franchise continues to deliver outstanding top line growth, margin improvement and profit growth.
Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital management. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong, including our cash flow, liquidity, investment portfolio, reserves and capital. It all starts with our operating performance, which produced $3.3 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter and $8.5 billion for the first 9 months. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter, even after our significant capital management actions.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $346 million in dividends. Through the 9 months ended September 30, we returned over $5 billion, including almost $4 billion in share repurchases or over 5% of our outstanding shares and dividends of over $1 billion. The agreement to acquire Cigna's A&H and life insurance businesses in Asia Pacific is not expected to impact our share repurchase and dividend commitments.
Our investment portfolio of $122 billion continues to be of a very high quality, and we have not made any material changes during the quarter to our investment allocation. The portfolio increased $759 million in the quarter. And at September 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $2.9 billion after tax. 
Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $940 million, similar to last quarter and $40 million higher than our estimated range, benefiting from higher private equity distributions. As I noted on the second quarter earnings call, our investment income is based on many factors. And notwithstanding our better-than-expected results over the last few quarters, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.
Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, with about $1 billion in the U.S., of which $806 million was from Hurricane Ida and $135 million from international events, of which $95 million was from flood losses in Europe. Our reserve position remained strong with net reserves increasing $1.7 billion or 3.2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter and 2021 growth, in particular, from our agricultural business, which has a seasonality impact on reserves. 
We had favorable prior period development of $321 million pretax, which includes $33 million of adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures. The remaining favorable development of $354 million was split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 70% in short-tail lines, principally from our 2020 North American personal lines. 
Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 73% or a very strong 75% after adjusting for cats, PPD and agriculture. Book value decreased by $744 million or [ 1.5% ], reflecting $1.16 billion in core operating income and a net gain on our investment portfolio of $190 million, which was more than offset by foreign exchange losses of $305 million and the $1.9 billion of share repurchases and dividends. Book and tangible book value per share increased 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, from last quarter.
Our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date was 12.3% and 14.4%, respectively. Our core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.6%, respectively, for the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include the fair value mark on our private equity funds and core operating income as many of our peer companies do. For comparison purposes, our core operating ROE increases by 5 percentage points to 13.2% and our core operating income increases by $1.61 per share to $4.25. Year-to-date, our core operating ROE, including the fair value mark on our PE funds, would be 13.8%.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen."

I'm going to answer it a little differently than that, and it's a broader statement that I'm making. And in the press release, it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years a rise in the fr",486,"Yes. I'm going to answer it a little differently than that, and it's a broader statement that I'm making. And in the press release, it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years a rise in the frequency and severity of insured losses globally from commercial and personal property arising from nat cat and especially losses from less well-modeled or non-modeled clauses. Our objective with all of this is twofold: price business adequately to pay for the risk; secondly, understand and manage accumulation of exposures against weather-related perils, modeled and non or less well modeled. 
Factors that are contributing to the rise in loss actually fall into 3 categories. First, we're seeing today changes globally in the frequency and severity of the perils such as tropical storms, wildfires and floods. However, the historical record provides some interesting context when thinking about today's risk environment. For example, recent land-falling U.S. hurricane activity is not especially anomalous in either frequency or frequency of intense storms as measured by wind speed compared to, say, the first part of the 20th century. And repeats of storms from this earlier period would, in fact, generate losses far greater than any modern storm in terms of industry loss, all of which is already contemplated in our modeling and risk management. And with all that said, though, there is evidence now that the amount of precipitation contained within the storms appears to be greater, and that is increasing the amount of loss emanating from events.
The second factor that contributes is changes to the exposure footprint of insurable personal and commercial properties, increases in actual exposure units and values from GDP growth, demographic shifts to higher risk geographies and aging building stock are all examples of factors that are leading to higher loss potential.
And finally, the third, the impact of natural events is further amplified by increasingly vulnerable infrastructure. For example, the levy failures during Hurricane Katrina in '05 and the systemic electric grid failure during the 2021 Texas freeze. We're actively working to reflect the impact of all of these trends in our pricing, risk selection and exposure management. We have significant advances in modeling, especially secondary perils such as floods and wildfires, but there's still a way to go.
Our loss costs consider recent experience, together with explicit recognition of factors that can be quantified such as sea level rise, exposure growth or demographic shifts. And we continue to refine our portfolio management -- our portfolio management to manage risk aggregation at an ever more granular level. The net results for us are dynamically risk-adjusted rates that appropriately reflect changes and charges for both recent loss experience and exposure concentrations. So we're striving to stay on top of this, and we have an awful lot of resources dedicated to the effort. And frankly, I think we're in pretty good shape."

No, the -- as simple as base prices, we're up significantly year-over-year in our spring crops. Corn and beans were up 18% and 29%, respectively. And we had another record year in terms of policy count acquisition growth and new acreage plan to be produced. So that really drove the 3-point growth that you've seen."

And they're just starting to open now through November. And we're starting to see growth pick up, in fact. And one, Louise can remind us, I think it's the month of September or October is our first month where we've seen real growth, and it was like, let's say, 8%. And we're all jumping up and down about it. However, to remind you, our travel is off about 85% from what it was in '19. So 8% has got a ways to go."

We were shrinking not a small amount in our footprint that is exposed to wildfire, both highly exposed and even moderately exposed to wildfire, which is not a small amount. And we gave an amount of premium that related to that, that would impact us. And that's because, in the State of California, in their own wisdom, we cannot charge an adequate price for the risk and not by a small amount. So someone else will have the pleasure of writing that business, unfortunately. And so we've been shrinking that in particular. Florida, we've been pretty steady."

And then putting the shovel in the ground takes a period of time. And the infrastructure bill, if I recall correctly, is to generate infrastructure improvements over a decade. But it will -- $1 trillion is an awful lot of infrastructure. 
Now the issue of labor will be very interesting to see. It's one thing to want to want to realize those infrastructure projects that our country sorely needs. And on the other hand, the labor to affect those projects is something that Congress is going to have to wrestle with and read into that immigration and temporary work visas for Mexicans and others south of the border who are very capable in executing that labor and, by the way, want to go home after they -- after working here. They don't want to necessarily remain here. And we have to rationally recognize that and address that as part of a 1.2 -- a $1 trillion infrastructure package if we're to spend it and make the difference we expect. And the insurance industry will be a beneficiary of that because those projects need to be insured, both construction and surety."
