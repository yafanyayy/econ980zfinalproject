I hope 2021 is off to a great start for everyone, and you're keeping safe and well as we continue to navigate this pandemic. I'm pleased to report that Cboe posted solid fourth quarter and record full year results, highlighting the strength and diversification of our global business. For the year, we grew net revenue by 10% and adjusted earnings per share by 11% despite an unprecedented macro environment that for much of the year did not favor index trading.
Our results were driven by record trading volumes in U.S. cash equities and multi-list options, fueled by strong retail trading, growth in recurring nontransactional revenues, and increased efficiency enabled by our fully integrated superior technology. Importantly, while achieving strong growth, we continue to successfully execute key growth initiatives to advance our strategy, to leverage product innovation and superior technology, expand our customer base and diversify our business mix with recurring revenue.
We also maintained our commitment to operational excellence in 2020, as evidenced by the continuity and resiliency of our markets despite the year's unrelenting challenges. Our ability to provide reliable and continuous markets in that environment, while continuing to execute key strategic initiatives and post strong growth is a testament to the dedication and expertise of our entire global team.
Additionally, our record results and strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $520 million to shareholders in 2020, a new all-time high and a 69% increase compared to 2019. Our commitment to returning capital to shareholders will continue in 2021 and beyond, reinforced by today's announcement regarding the Board's authorization of additional share buyback capacity.
Turning to our targets and expectations for this year. We plan to leverage the deals we closed in 2020 to accelerate organic growth in 2021. Brian will do a deeper dive on this, but we plan to invest approximately $25 million in organic growth initiatives in 2021, which we expect to contribute to our incremental top line compounded average organic growth target of 4% to 6% over the midterm.
As you've seen since our IPO, we have also allocated capital inorganically to help accelerate our strategy while returning capital to shareholders. Over the past 4 years, we have delivered 5% compound annual net revenue growth, while growing adjusted EPS by 19% on a pro forma basis, which reflects the strength of our strategy and our ability to perform in the most challenging cycles.
The success of our ongoing diversification reinforces our confidence in continued growth. Additionally, while we're only 5 weeks into the new year, we are beginning to see institutional investors reengage in trading our index options and volatility products. In January, month-over-month volume increased by 77% in VIX futures, 68% in VIX options and 15% in SPX options. As we've noted in previous calls, we expected to see reengagement in these products once there was more clarity around the political and pandemic uncertainty that clouded investors' views on where the market was headed. Although much uncertainty remains around the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccine rollout has begun. The new U.S. administration is in place, and the Brexit deal has been executed.
We believe we will continue to see increased trading in our index products as the uncertainty of these and other previous market unknowns come into focus. Additionally, in response to customer demand, similar to VIX futures, we are planning to extend the 245 trading model to VIX and SPX options in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory review.
Over 15% of trading and big futures, which already trade   24 5  , took place in non-U.S. trading hours last year, up from 13% in 2019. Naturally, we believe   24 5   trading in VIX and SPX options will result in increased trading outside of U.S. hours as well. We began the year with a considerable amount of momentum from strategic progress made in 2020. We're excited about both near and long-term opportunities to grow and expand our business, driven in part by increases in proprietary product trading, recurring revenue and retail engagement, while continuing to invest in long-term growth.
Our ongoing strategy, which has reinforced the value of our unique platform and fueled our strong year-over-year growth remains consistent, further strengthen our core proprietary products, leverage our superior technology, increased recurring revenue, broaden our geographic footprint and expand our product line by asset class.
We have exciting initiatives underway within each of these strategic pillars. But today, I'd like to focus on 4 incremental growth drivers. The opportunity to grow nontransactional revenue through Cboe Information Solutions, our plans to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, expand bids trading and grow our retail training base.
We're excited about our prospects to further increase recurring revenue through expanding and enhancing Cboe information Solutions, our comprehensive suite of data solutions, analytics and indices. These products generate recurring revenue by providing market participants with value-added trading resources and support transactional growth in our proprietary products with tools that draw users to our markets and drive volume as they reestablish trading positions. As discussed in previous calls, last year's expansion of our information solutions offering through key acquisitions accelerate our ability to grow our recurring nontransactional revenue. 
In 2020, we reported 12% growth in recurring nontransactional revenue and 9% organic growth, and we expect to see incremental sustainable long-term growth as we continue to optimize these integrations in 2021. Importantly, our expansion of information Solutions now allows us to interact with and add value to market participants at every step of the trade process. We are looking to enhance these customer support opportunities in 2021 with additional portfolio and risk analytics offered through various delivery mechanisms, including Cboe Silexx, our proprietary order execution management system and through our APIs. Additionally, we plan to expand our market intelligence analytics and alerts to many market segments, including retail traders. We also plan to expand our global indices platform, which provides index calculation development and services with real-time distribution channels. Finally, we expect to further expand our offering of unique historical data sets and add high demand data sets like cryptocurrencies to the information Solutions data suite.
Turning now to the upcoming planned launch of Cboe Europe derivatives. I'm pleased to say we are on track to launch in the second quarter of this year pending regulatory approval, bringing to fruition our vision to unlock the potential we see for considerable growth in this market.
Our highly successful European Equities business, global derivatives expertise and ownership of EuroCCP uniquely position us to simplify and bring new efficiencies to pan-European derivatives trading and clearing. We've worked closely with market participants in shaping our plans and have received very positive customer feedback and support. During the fourth quarter, we made strong progress on the technical build-out of the exchange and clearing platform and toward achieving the necessary regulatory approvals.
Customer testing and optimization is ongoing. And we have commitments from clearing firms, order flow providers and market makers to be there on day 1. As we've said before, we think this market is ripe for significant structural growth. We are not aiming simply to take market share from incumbent exchanges. We intend to shape and grow overall derivatives trading in Europe with a novel market structure designed to attract both new and existing participants. While our revenue expectations for European derivatives in 2021 are modest, we are investing for long-term growth and looking for a gradual revenue build as we gain traction and expand our product offering to realize what we view as a paradigm shift in European derivatives trading.
Our new Amsterdam exchange, which we launched in 2019 in advance of Brexit will serve as home to our derivatives business in the region. I'll also note here that the flawless implementation of our Brexit strategy enabled us to seamlessly transition trading from our U.K. venue to Amsterdam at the start of the year.
Also as a result of Brexit, we were excited to welcome back trading of Swiss shares on our U.K. venue yesterday. We are working with customers to reestablish our market share in Swiss Equities trading, which was approximately 8% of Cboe's notional value traded in June of 2019 when Swiss trading was last available on our market.
Turning now to our acquisition of Bids trading, which we completed at the end of the fourth quarter. We're pleased to welcome Tim Mahoney to the team and the Cboe family. We have a successful track record of working with Bids, which powers Cboe LIS, one of the largest block training platforms in Europe. 
While Bids will continue to operate as independently manage venue, the acquisition helps us to expand Bid's block training capabilities and services to other products and geographies, including Canada, as we look to further expand our presence in North American equities. We are well underway with our integration of MATCHNow. The Canadian ATS we acquired last year, and the Bids acquisition provides additional features that we believe will help us disrupt the electronic block market in Canada and other markets in the future.
Bids has an extensive global network of more than 460 buy side investment managers and sell-side constituents, which differentiates the platform and provides a strong foundation from which to expand into new markets. Bids also provides us with a foothold in the off exchange segment of the U.S. equity market, which now accounts for over 45% of overall U.S. equities trading.
Moving on to retail trading. We believe the resurgence of the retail investor we saw in 2020 is here to stay. We are well equipped to deliver tailored products and services to meet the needs of these growing customer base and to evolve our education programs with retail-centric content to empower these new investors.
Product innovation remains a core focus of the Cboe franchise. We plan to continue to expand our proprietary product offering with smaller contract sizes that appeal to both sophisticated retail traders and institutional investors. This includes mini big futures and mini SPX options, our recently announced media Russell 2,000 index options as well as additional retail-focused products in our pipeline, which we will extend our value-add to a broader unit-based universe of investors.
Our strategy to nurture growth in these products, which is driven by a cross-functional team focused and dedicated client services, targets marketing initiatives and robust investor education is well underway. Additionally, we continue to see increased retail trading in U.S. equities and record volume in our retail priority program, which helps improve execution quality and trading outcomes for individual investors and firms that facilitate their orders.
Volume and retail priority orders represented over 31% of total volume on Cboe EDGX with the exchange reaching record market share of 7.3% in the fourth quarter. In January, trading on EDGX set a new monthly average daily volume record as did retail priority orders, which were up 56% over December of 2020. We're excited to see growing retail engagement in the marketplace and are well positioned to invest in and leverage our core strengths, product and market innovation, technology, strong customer relationships and investor education to support this growing user base.
We believe our investments in this area will benefit retail investors and create another sustainable long-term growth opportunity for Cboe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to walk through our 2020 performance and 2021 outlook in greater detail and then provide some closing remarks."

Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 4Q '20 as compared to 4Q '19, and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.",1486,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I hope all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 4Q '20 as compared to 4Q '19, and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. We reported solid financial results for the quarter, again, highlighting diversification of our revenue streams and the contributions from our investments and acquisitions, reinforcing our strategic initiatives.
Our net revenue increased 10%, with net transaction fees up 8% and revenue from our recurring nontransactional revenue up 16%, adjusted operating expenses increased 17%, adjusted EBITDA of $206 million was up 4%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.21 flat to last year. 
Turning the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide summary thoughts. The growth in our options segment was driven by a continuation of strong trading in our multi listed options and higher revenue from proprietary market data, offset somewhat by lower volumes in our proprietary products.
Revenue from North American equities decreased as a result of lower data. Revenue from the SIP including lower SIP audit recoveries, off exchange or TRF volume hit new highs again in the fourth quarter, impacting our market share. In futures, the revenue decline was caused by lower trading volume and fixed futures. The revenue increase in European equities primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP. And FX increased ADNV, drove higher transaction fees, and growth in access to capacity fees contributed to higher nontransactional revenue.
We're also proud to announce our market share surge to a new record high of 16.7%. Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were about $112 million for the quarter, up 17% against last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses, were up 4% for the quarter and actually down 2% for the year. Majority of the expense variance related to acquisitions was compensation and benefits. 
Turning now to our 2021 guidance. As Ed noted, our plans for 2021 and beyond call for continued investments to drive long-term sustainable growth in our business. For 2021, our organic revenue target is a growth rate of 6% to 7% from our recurring nontransactional revenue, which we define as access capacity fees plus proprietary market data fees. Similar to prior years, we anticipate the majority of this growth to be driven by additional units versus pricing and changes. After incorporating our ISG acquisitions, we expect the reported or total growth rate for this category to be 7% to 8%. In the aggregate, we expect the acquisitions closed in 2020 to contribute additional growth of 4% to 6% in 2021. Longer to midterm, we are targeting organic top line compounded average annual growth of 4% to 6%. 
Given our growth plans and strategic opportunities, we are planning incremental investment of $24 million to $26 million in 2021 to help increase that growth rate in the future, which I'll discuss further in a moment. Moving to our expense guidance. We expect adjusted operating expenses to be in a range of $531 million to $539 million versus $416 million in 2020.
The projected $115 million to $123 million year-over-year expense increase falls into 3 main categories: 2020 normalization, core and incremental investment. First, 2020 normalization. Approximately $71 million or nearly 60% of the increase is due to incremental expenses from 2020 acquisitions or about $55 million, which will contribute to our long-term growth profile and nonrecurring savings in 2020 that we do not expect to repeat in 2021.
The nonrecurring statements realized in 2020 include a COVID-related savings, the favorable accrual adjustments related to incentive compensation and facilities expenses and see delays in hiring, which were also caused by disruptions related to COVID 19. 
If you normalize our 2020 expenses for these items, projected expense increase is approximately 10%. Based on the current market outlook, we expect these costs will recur in 2022 and beyond. Although, as we demonstrated in 2020, we are able to optimize our cost to preserve our differentiated track record of margin expansion.
Second, core expenses. We expect these expenses to increase by approximately $14 million to $18 million or 3% to 4% growth. This category includes our annual compensation adjustments, incremental infrastructure costs and otherwise general price increases. However, should we remain in a more locked down state for an extended period of time in 2021, we expect the expense growth should be muted. We expect to also incur incremental facility overlap costs of approximately $7 million to $8 million as we transition our Chicago headquarters and other office space.
We do not expect the majority of this cost to recur in 2022. And finally, incremental investment. As Ed highlighted earlier, in support of our strategy, we plan to invest approximately $24 million to $26 million in 2021 to drive incremental and sustainable long-term organic revenue growth and high conviction, high return opportunities.
This includes $9 million to $10 million for our previously announced European derivatives build out as well as investments aimed at supporting growth index options and futures, including developing, listing and distributing unique products and enhancing marketing, education and content, as well as our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors, among other initiatives. 
As we have demonstrated in the past, we have the flexibility to adjust the magnitude of our overall expense through the year. Though the market conditions for our transaction revenue weakened, there are multiple levers with which we may adjust our investment levels to help realize the strong underlying margin profile of our business model. As the year develops, we will revisit how we are calibrating our investment to the current market reality to optimize both margin and long-term growth potential.
Turning to our summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $38 million to $42 million for 2021 compared to $34 million in 2020. This excludes amortization of intangibles of approximately $116 million.
Moving to income taxes. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 28.6%, above last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.7%. Absent the higher tax rate, earnings per share would have increased 6%, which reflects the impact of higher adjusted earnings, netted against the incremental benefit of reducing our share count by nearly 3% over the last 12 months. Our full-year 2021 tax rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 29.5% versus 21 -- 28.1% in 2020.
Finally, we expect 2021 capital spending to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million, reflecting expenditures for the build-out of a new trading floor and higher investments in technology and infrastructure to support our acquisitions and other growth initiatives.
We expect 2021 to be an above trend line CapEx year due to the various investments noted. And over time, we expect CapEx to return to a more normalized level of $40 million to $45 million. While we're not providing full year guidance on interest expense, we wanted to highlight that absent any additional borrowing, significant changes in LIBOR, our quarterly interest expense for the first quarter of 2021 is expected to be $12 million to $13 million, which is slightly lower than the 4Q 2020 numbers, which include incremental fees related to refinancing costs.
Moving to capital allocation. Our priorities have not changed as we remain committed to investing in our growth strategy while returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you heard from Ed, recent acquisitions of URS CCP and Bids reflect conviction in our ability to deploy capital, to enhance organic growth and strategic value over time, leveraging the robust technology at the core of our strong operating leverage profile.
From a capital return perspective, our record financial results in 2020 and cash flow generation enable us to return the highest amount of cash to shareholders since becoming a public company. We plan to continue being opportunistic for share repurchases, as highlighted by this morning's announcement of up to an additional $200 million in buyback capacity, bringing our total availability to approximately $400 million as of the end of January 2021.
In December, we completed a $500 million bond offering used to fund the Bid acquisition, repay amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and a portion of amounts under our term loan as well as other general corporate purposes.
Our leverage ratio increased diverse from 1.1x at September 30 due to the higher debt outstanding. We ended the year with adjusted cash of $210 million, reflecting in part, higher balance associated with additional regulatory operating cash needs for EuroCCP. Now I'd like to turn it back to over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

I would say that without getting specifically with each expense for each of the transactions from 2020, each deal that we did, I think we announced that they were accretive or neutral.

So I think that gives you a pretty good gauge of where we expect the revenue more than offset the expense adjustment that we've noted here on -- as you mentioned, Slide 13, for the $55 million.
So in the aggregate, it's going to be accretive, as we noted previously. On the $16 million, I think, as a rough framework, and again, it's your guess is as good as mine. And obviously, we've got to put a number out there that we're kind of reflecting in our expense guide as far as 2021.
Of the 3 categories I kind of mentioned, I would say high level, it's probably like 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 relative to continued savings for -- if there continues to be some lockdown and we really don't do anything during '21 as far as some of those incremental expenses that we have, some of that savings delay from the delayed hiring was probably 1/3 of that. And then the onetime statements is about 1/3 that we won't get the benefit. 
So that kind of gives you a frame of reference of like I said, with the COVID-19 related expenses and how that might expense -- impact the expenses for '21."

So again, it's a spend, I want to remind everyone that, that's a spend to really grow that top line revenue for the long term. And so the upfront investment spend, as we've said, with derivatives, as we said before, we'll have to occur before the actual revenue show up and certainly in '21 while we're planning.

Thanks for the question there. As we think about that. It's -- we know that -- first of all start off with that medium-term target, and it's not obviously a next year guide because we know that sometimes there's unpredictability in transaction revenue quarter-over-quarter or even a few quarters over time. And so that's why we want to make sure people understood our view over a, call it a medium term.
And also, it's incredibly consistent with Lecta what we've achieved over the last 4 years, as Ed kind of referenced to earlier. I would say that we -- it's going to be a combination. We already laid out the nontransaction revenue growth expectation as far as our proprietary products -- the proprietary market and access capacity fees how we laid that out. Obviously, you have -- for us, you have the SIP, the take plans, which is at best, probably flat.
And then you have the remainder being made up on the transaction revenue side. Again, that is over time versus any one period of time. So that's, I think, how if you look at the primary drivers of how that looks and what we've achieved. But again, it's -- we're looking to -- as you can just see the math and you do the numbers, is that, look, there's going to be more recurring revenues as we continue to build that.
You're seeing a more diversified base. And frankly, it's just -- it's a higher conviction that over time, that we're building that sustainable revenue, and that's how that's growing. And you're going to have the impact of the acquisitions that we talked about, which again, is not in that organic number, but as that rolls into that number over time, again, we feel good about how that continues to grow as well."

I'll start with the first and then invite John and Chris on the ISG, in particular. So product segment, I think, if you just take half a step back, and what we discussed primarily for the 3 quarters of last year after the huge volumes and volatility spike in the first quarter, what institutions told us that they're on the sidelines, there's too much uncertainty out there, right?
If you think about this, pandemic just being defined U.S. elections on the map, uncertainty there led to a runoff election, Brexit coming, going, closing, not closing and told us once some of those uncertainties were passed, that there'd be reengagement, that there needs to be, and there's a demand for exposure more broadly in the U.S. market, and that's what we're seeing in January. 
So just basically feeding back directly from those institutional users in their plans and moving forward, and we're seeing that engagement. So that's really not surprising to us. Stressed, I think, maybe your word, probably a little bit too much of a reach. I think we're seeing more broadly interest in short-term moves and volatility. A lot of that led by the volatility in single names. Raising volatility overall. And then if we look at VIX options, we see interest in buying puts when people realize or investors realize, gosh, that spike, don't think that's sustainable. We saw that last week, and we saw put buying, and sure enough, investors in this cycle tended to be right.
So we see engagement across now a variety of macro trading cycles, and I like it. The engagement is up and down our proprietary products, led by institutions reengagement. So I don't think I'd call any segment out not reengaging maybe some slower than others, but it's engagement each and every day. And we like to see what we're seeing in January, I'd love to see that continue. Chris and John, maybe on the ISG question."

So to get data that access and then managing your portfolio with risks, and we feel like we have a full suite for them to really engage and use our products in a very efficient and effective manner.
And I'll end with offering unique products, an example would be flex there, for instance, which is getting a broad use for target outcome investing.

And in this case, really, there's a tight fit with those acquisitions because what they do is they drive the decision-making process for largely institutional investors on that side. This is a long-term trend. It's not a 1-year trend, not a 2-year trend. We're in the middle phases, I'd say, of institutions automating their decision-making processes, especially from complex instruments like those that drive our proprietary product revenues.
And so automating things like the pricing evaluation process, risk mitigation, margin processes, we're giving tools to institutions to allow them to automate their processes and engage more deeply in our product set. So we see a lot of long-term potential. And remember, we're doing this all the while, while we extract revenues because there's value in the product itself. So not only are people trading more as a result of the ISG products, but the IST products themselves, have value, and they're contributing to our growing base of recurring revenues."

And part of the -- keeping that balance sheet, I'll call it, low leverage, is that if there's something that does become attractive that makes sense, we want to make sure we could potentially deploy that capital.
But absent that, again, the prioritization really hasn't changed. It's a continuing dialogue, again, we have with the Board, we have the management team. You see it reflected in the share repurchase increase, with the confidence and outlook for the stock is growing the repurchase authorization. But again, the prioritization of, look, it's -- we're going to focus on organic initiatives, as we talked about, been the focus of the call today and our guidance going forward. 
We always continue to have a commitment to that -- an annual dividend increase. We -- again, and then with the share repurchase, as I mentioned, we'll continue to look for that to be opportunistic. And depending on where all those rank -- or excuse me, where the last one, the share repurchase and delevering. I personally don't see as much value in delevering today versus, say, for example, out than anything else, continue to return cash to shareholders.

I will say that January, and I don't really be flipped with my response, doesn't make a year. So that has been strong volumes. And so it does certainly play into how we thought about the year and what can be achieved. So having that as a backdrop, we're not using January to inform our entire year and what we're doing, but there's obviously some trends there that we're seeing continue on as Ed talked about, as the rest of the team has talked about from the institutional activity from the retail activity on a go-forward basis in the various products and the various asset classes. 
As far as the investment spend outlook and where do we expect to see the return, how long. And that will vary by each product. As we talked about and Ed mentioned the where the investment priorities were with respect to non transaction revenue growth, European derivatives build-out, the bids expansion, the retail, the 24/5, the extended trading hours. All of those things are coming more or less online, as we talked about in 2020 and we're in the latter half of 2020. 
And we said, these are investments in '20 for -- in '21 for a '22 kind of more significant growth contribution for revenue. So it's -- I can't go right now and say it's going to happen in this quarter other than there's a possibility that, yes, we're going to expect to see some revenues in '21. But again, it's later in the year. But the real expectation that I think our investment community should have is that it's a '22 revenue growth delivery.
And again, what we're looking to make sure that we're delivering on is, at the end of the day, we're trying to have a secular growth of the business. And again, we see the increasing need for the data and analytics, the need for better access and addressing that demand with a new product, new geography, which again is represented by, I think, the 4 kind of areas that we're prioritizing.
So that's a long-winded way of saying, I'm not going to give you revenue guidance as far as '21 and that we expect to start seeing that in '22 and beyond. And obviously, and this is true probably with most firms. We see a really, really large ROI on organic activities that, especially if we can leverage the existing infrastructure and you leverage the existing network that we have today and really meeting a demand and access capacity that we see really high ROI, and that's, again, that's a 2 to 3 year look. 
And again, that helps contribute to that medium to long-term growth rate that we talked about upfront."

I'm pleased to report that Cboe posted solid fourth quarter a",1903,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope 2021 is off to a great start for everyone, and you're keeping safe and well as we continue to navigate this pandemic. I'm pleased to report that Cboe posted solid fourth quarter and record full year results, highlighting the strength and diversification of our global business. For the year, we grew net revenue by 10% and adjusted earnings per share by 11% despite an unprecedented macro-environment that for much of the year did not favor index trading. 
Our results were driven by record trading volumes in U.S. cash equities and multi-list options, fueled by strong retail trading, growth in recurring nontransactional revenues, and increased efficiency enabled by our fully integrated superior technology. Importantly, while achieving strong growth, we continue to successfully execute key growth initiatives to advance our strategy, to leverage product innovation and superior technology, expand our customer base and diversify our business mix with recurring revenue. 
We also maintained our commitment to operational excellence in 2020, as evidenced by the continuity and resiliency of our markets despite the year's unrelenting challenges. Our ability to provide reliable and continuous markets in that environment, while continuing to execute key strategic initiatives and post strong growth is a testament to the dedication and expertise of our entire global team. 
Additionally, our record results and strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $520 million to shareholders in 2020, a new all-time high and a 69% increase compared to 2019. Our commitment to returning capital to shareholders will continue in 2021 and beyond, reinforced by today's announcement regarding the Board's authorization of additional share buyback capacity. 
Turning to our targets and expectations for this year. We plan to leverage the deals we closed in 2020 to accelerate organic growth in 2021. Brian will do a deeper dive on this, but we plan to invest approximately $25 million in organic growth initiatives in 2021, which we expect to contribute to our incremental top line compounded average organic growth target of 4% to 6% over the midterm. 
As you've seen since our IPO, we have also allocated capital inorganically to help accelerate our strategy while returning capital to shareholders. Over the past 4 years, we have delivered 5% compound annual net revenue growth, while growing adjusted EPS by 19% on a pro forma basis, which reflects the strength of our strategy and our ability to perform in the most challenging cycles. 
The success of our ongoing diversification reinforces our confidence in continued growth. Additionally, while we're only 5 weeks into the new year, we are beginning to see institutional investors reengage in trading our index options and volatility products. In January, month-over-month volume increased by 77% in VIX futures, 68% in VIX options and 15% in SPX options. 
As we've noted in previous calls, we expected to see reengagement in these products once there was more clarity around the political and pandemic uncertainty that clouded investors' views on where the market was headed. Although much uncertainty remains around the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccine rollout has begun. The new U.S. administration is in place, and the Brexit deal has been executed. 
We believe we will continue to see increased trading in our index products as the uncertainty of these and other previous market unknowns come into focus. Additionally, in response to customer demand, similar to VIX futures, we are planning to extend the 24/5 trading model to VIX and SPX options in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory review. 
Over 15% of trading in VIX futures, which already trade 24/5, took place in non-U.S. trading hours last year, up from 13% in 2019. Naturally, we believe 24/5 trading in VIX and SPX options will result in increased trading outside of U.S. hours as well. 
We began the year with a considerable amount of momentum from strategic progress made in 2020. We're excited about both near and long-term opportunities to grow and expand our business, driven in part by increases in proprietary product trading, recurring revenue and retail engagement while continuing to invest in long-term growth. 
Our ongoing strategy, which has reinforced the value of our unique platform and fueled our strong year-over-year growth remains consistent, further strengthen our core proprietary products, leverage our superior technology, increased recurring revenue, broaden our geographic footprint and expand our product line by asset class. We have exciting initiatives underway within each of these strategic pillars. But today, I'd like to focus on 4 incremental growth drivers. The opportunity to grow nontransactional revenue through Cboe Information Solutions, our plans to launch Cboe Europe Derivatives, expand BIDS trading and grow our retail training base. 
We're excited about our prospects to further increase recurring revenue through expanding and enhancing Cboe Information Solutions, our comprehensive suite of data solutions, analytics and indices. These products generate recurring revenue by providing market participants with value-added trading resources and support transactional growth in our proprietary products with tools that draw users to our markets and drive volume as they reestablish trading positions. 
As discussed in previous calls, last year's expansion of our Information Solutions offering through key acquisitions accelerate our ability to grow our recurring nontransactional revenue. In 2020, we reported 12% growth in recurring nontransactional revenue and 9% organic growth, and we expect to see incremental sustainable long-term growth as we continue to optimize these integrations in 2021. 
Importantly, our expansion of Information Solutions now allows us to interact with and add value to market participants at every step of the trade process. We are looking to enhance these customer support opportunities in 2021 with additional portfolio and risk analytics offered through various delivery mechanisms, including Cboe Silexx, our proprietary order execution management system and through our APIs. 
Additionally, we plan to expand our market intelligence analytics and alerts to many market segments, including retail traders. We also plan to expand our global indices platform, which provides index calculation development and services with real-time distribution channels. Finally, we expect to further expand our offering of unique historical data sets and add high demand data sets like cryptocurrencies to the Information Solutions data suite. 
Turning now to the upcoming planned launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives. I'm pleased to say we are on track to launch in the second quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. Bringing to fruition our vision to unlock the potential we see for considerable growth in this market. 
Our highly successful European Equities business, Global Derivatives expertise and ownership of EuroCCP uniquely position us to simplify and bring new efficiencies to pan-European derivatives trading and clearing. We've worked closely with market participants in shaping our plans and have received very positive customer feedback and support. During the fourth quarter, we made strong progress on the technical buildout of the exchange and clearing platform and toward achieving the necessary regulatory approvals. 
Customer testing and optimization is ongoing. And we have commitments from clearing firms, order flow providers and market makers to be there on day 1. As we've said before, we think this market is ripe for significant structural growth. We are not aiming simply to take market share from incumbent exchanges. We intend to shape and grow overall derivatives trading in Europe with a novel market structure designed to attract both new and existing participants. While our revenue expectations for European derivatives in 2021 are modest, we are investing for long-term growth and looking for a gradual revenue build as we gain traction and expand our product offering to realize what we view as a paradigm shift in European Derivatives trading. 
Our new Amsterdam exchange, which we launched in 2019 in advance of Brexit will serve as home to our derivatives business in the region. I'll also note here that the flawless implementation of our Brexit strategy enabled us to seamlessly transition trading from our U.K. venue to Amsterdam at the start of the year. 
Also as a result of Brexit, we were excited to welcome back trading of Swiss shares on our U.K. venue yesterday. We are working with customers to reestablish our market share in Swiss equities trading, which was approximately 8% of Cboe's notional value traded in June of 2019 when Swiss trading was last available on our market. 
Turning now to our acquisition of BIDS trading, which we completed at the end of the fourth quarter. We're pleased to welcome Tim Mahoney to the team and the Cboe family. We have a successful track record of working with BIDS, which powers Cboe LIS, one of the largest block training platforms in Europe.  
While BIDS will continue to operate as an independently manage venue, the acquisition helps us to expand BIDS block training capabilities and services to other products and geographies, including Canada, as we look to further expand our presence in North American equities. 
We are well underway with our integration of MATCHNow. The Canadian ATS we acquired last year, and the BIDS acquisition provides additional features that we believe will help us disrupt the electronic block market in Canada and other markets in the future. BIDS has an extensive global network of more than 460 buy-side investment managers and sell-side constituents, which differentiates the platform and provides a strong foundation from which to expand into new markets. BIDS also provides us with a foothold in the off-exchange segment of the U.S. equity market, which now accounts for over 45% of overall U.S. equities trading. 
Moving on to retail trading. We believe the resurgence of the retail investor we saw in 2020 is here to stay. We are well equipped to deliver tailored products and services to meet the needs of these growing customer base and to evolve our education programs with retail-centric content to empower these new investors. 
Product innovation remains a core focus of the Cboe franchise. We plan to continue to expand our proprietary product offering with smaller contract sizes that appeal to both sophisticated retail traders and institutional investors. This includes Mini-VIX futures and Mini-SPX options, our recently announced Mini-Russell 2000 Index Options as well as additional retail-focused products in our pipeline, which we will extend our value-add to a broader unit-based -- universe of investors. 
Our strategy to nurture growth in these products, which is driven by a cross-functional team focused and dedicated client services, targets marketing initiatives and robust investor education is well underway. Additionally, we continue to see increased retail trading in U.S. equities and record volume in our retail priority program, which helps improve execution quality and trading outcomes for individual investors and firms that facilitate their orders. 
Volume and retail priority orders represented over 31% of total volume on Cboe EDGX with the exchange reaching record market share of 7.3% in the fourth quarter. In January, trading on EDGX set a new monthly average daily volume record as did retail priority orders, which were up 56% over December of 2020. We're excited to see growing retail engagement in the marketplace and are well positioned to invest in and leverage our core strengths, product and market innovation, technology, strong customer relationships and investor education to support this growing user base. 
We believe our investments in this area will benefit retail investors and create another sustainable long-term growth opportunity for Cboe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to walk through our 2020 performance and 2021 outlook in greater detail and then provide some closing remarks."

I hope all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 4Q '20 as compared to 4Q '19, and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. 
We reported solid financial results for the quarter, again, highlighting diversification of our revenue streams and the contributions from our investments and acquisitions, reinforcing our strategic initiatives. 
Our net revenue increased 10%, with net transaction fees up 8% and revenue from our recurring nontransactional revenue up 16%, adjusted operating expenses increased 17%, adjusted EBITDA of $206 million was up 4%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.21 flat to last year.  
Turning to key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide summary thoughts. The growth in our options segment was driven by a continuation of strong trading in our multi-listed options and higher revenue from proprietary market data, offset somewhat by lower volumes in our proprietary products. 
Revenue from North American equities decreased as a result of lower data. Revenue from the SIP, including lower SIP audit recoveries, off-exchange or TRF volume hit new highs again in the fourth quarter, impacting our market share. In futures, the revenue decline was caused by lower trading volume and fixed futures. The revenue increase in European equities primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP. And FX increased ADNV, drove higher transaction fees, and growth in access to capacity fees contributed to higher nontransactional revenue. 
We're also proud to announce our market share surge to a new record high of 16.7%. Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were about $112 million for the quarter, up 17% against last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses were up 4% for the quarter and actually down 2% for the year. Majority of the expense variance related to acquisitions was compensation and benefits.  
Turning now to our 2021 guidance. As Ed noted, our plans for 2021 and beyond call for continued investments to drive long-term sustainable growth in our business. For 2021, our organic revenue target is a growth rate of 6% to 7% from our recurring nontransactional revenue, which we define as access capacity fees plus proprietary market data fees. Similar to prior years, we anticipate the majority of this growth to be driven by additional units versus pricing changes. 
After incorporating our ISG acquisitions, we expect the reported or total growth rate for this category to be 7% to 8%. In the aggregate, we expect the acquisitions closed in 2020 to contribute additional growth of 4% to 6% in 2021. Longer to midterm, we are targeting organic top line compounded average annual growth of 4% to 6%.  Given our growth plans and strategic opportunities, we are planning incremental investment of $24 million to $26 million in 2021 to help increase that growth rate in the future, which I'll discuss further in a moment. 
Moving to our expense guidance. We expect adjusted operating expenses to be in a range of $531 million to $539 million versus $416 million in 2020. The projected $115 million to $123 million year-over-year expense increase falls into 3 main categories: 2020 normalization, core and incremental investment. 
First, 2020 normalization. Approximately $71 million or nearly 60% of the increase is due to incremental expenses from 2020 acquisitions or about $55 million, which will contribute to our long-term growth profile and nonrecurring savings in 2020 that we do not expect to repeat in 2021. The nonrecurring statements realized in 2020 include a COVID-related savings, the favorable accrual adjustments related to incentive compensation and facilities expenses and see delays in hiring, which were also caused by disruptions related to COVID 19.  
If you normalize our 2020 expenses for these items, projected expense increase is approximately 10%. Based on the current market outlook, we expect these costs will recur in 2022 and beyond. Although, as we demonstrated in 2020, we are able to optimize our cost to preserve our differentiated track record of margin expansion. 
Second, core expenses. We expect these expenses to increase by approximately $14 million to $18 million or 3% to 4% growth. This category includes our annual compensation adjustments, incremental infrastructure costs and otherwise general price increases. However, should we remain in a more locked down state for an extended period of time in 2021, we expect the expense growth should be muted. We expect to also incur incremental facility overlap costs of approximately $7 million to $8 million as we transition our Chicago headquarters and other office space. We do not expect the majority of this cost to recur in 2022. 
And finally, incremental investment. As Ed highlighted earlier, in support of our strategy, we plan to invest approximately $24 million to $26 million in 2021 to drive incremental and sustainable long-term organic revenue growth and high conviction, high return opportunities. This includes $9 million to $10 million for our previously announced European Derivatives buildout as well as investments aimed at supporting growth, index, options and futures, including developing, listing and distributing unique products and enhancing marketing, education and content, as well as our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors, among other initiatives. 
As we have demonstrated in the past, we have the flexibility to adjust the magnitude of our overall expense through the year. Should market conditions for our transaction revenue weakens, there are multiple levers with which we may adjust our investment levels to help realize the strong underlying margin profile of our business model. As the year develops, we will revisit how we are calibrating our investments to the current market reality to optimize both margins and long-term growth potential. 
Turning to our summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $38 million to $42 million for 2021 compared to $34 million in 2020. This excludes amortization of intangibles of approximately $116 million. 
Moving to income taxes. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 28.6%, above last year's fourth quarter rate of 24.7%. Absent the higher tax rate, earnings per share would have increased 6%, which reflects the impact of higher adjusted earnings, netted against the incremental benefit of reducing our share count by nearly 3% over the last 12 months. Our full-year 2021 tax rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 29.5% versus 21 -- 28.1% in 2020. 
Finally, we expect 2021 capital spending to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million, reflecting expenditures for the buildout of a new trading floor and higher investments in technology and infrastructure to support our acquisitions and other growth initiatives. 
We expect 2021 to be an above trend line CapEx year due to the various investments noted. And over time, we expect CapEx to return to a more normalized level of $40 million to $45 million. While we're not providing full year guidance on interest expense, we wanted to highlight that absent any additional borrowing, significant changes in LIBOR, our quarterly interest expense for the first quarter of 2021 is expected to be $12 million to $13 million, which is slightly lower than the 4Q 2020 numbers, which include incremental fees related to refinancing costs. 
Moving to capital allocation. Our priorities have not changed as we remain committed to investing in our growth strategy while returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you heard from Ed, recent acquisitions of EuroCCP and BIDS reflect conviction in our ability to deploy capital, to enhance organic growth and strategic value over time, leveraging the robust technology at the core of our strong operating leverage profile. 
From a capital return perspective, our record financial results in 2020 and cash flow generation enable us to return the highest amount of cash to shareholders since becoming a public company. We plan to continue being opportunistic for share repurchases, as highlighted by this morning's announcement of up to an additional $200 million in buyback capacity, bringing our total availability to approximately $400 million as of the end of January 2021. In December, we completed a $500 million bond offering used to fund the BIDS acquisition, repay amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and a portion of amounts under our term loan as well as other general corporate purposes. 
Our leverage ratio increased to 1.4x at December 31 from 1.1x at September 30 due to the higher debt outstanding. We ended the year with adjusted cash of $210 million, reflecting in part, higher balance associated with additional regulatory operating cash needs for EuroCCP. Now I'd like to turn it back to over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

I would say that without getting specifically with each expense for each of the transactions from 2020, each deal that we did, I think we announced that they were accretive or neutral. So you would have an expectation. And we gave a broad range of the revenue expectations across the prior years of that 4% to 6% on prior years. So I think that gives you a pretty good gauge of where we expect the revenue more than offset the expense adjustment that we've noted here on -- as you mentioned, Slide 13, for the $55 million. 
So in the aggregate, it's going to be accretive, as we noted previously. On the $16 million, I think, as a rough framework, and again, it's -- your guess is as good as mine. And obviously, we've got to put a number out there that we're kind of reflecting in our expense guide as far as 2021. Of the 3 categories I kind of mentioned, I would say high level, it's probably like 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 relative to continued savings for -- if there continues to be some lockdown and we really don't do anything during '21 as far as some of those incremental expenses that we have, some of that savings delay from the delayed hiring was probably 1/3 of that. And then the onetime savings is about 1/3 that we won't get the benefit.  So that kind of gives you a frame of reference of like I said, with the COVID-19 related expenses and how that might expense -- impact the expenses for '21."

So I'd say about -- could be up to 1/4 of that will not repeat as we go forward because there's an incremental investment in the upfront years. Some of that was in '20 and obviously, you're seeing our projection for '21 as far as that buildout. 
As far as the strategic growth initiatives, and that will vary based on what we end up spending as far as how much of that is permanent and fixed versus on a go-forward basis. So I think that it's going to be -- and again, we'll provide more guidance to this as we move forward as we look at where the actual level of investment is, it's -- again, it's looking at -- the total dollar amount, again, will be geared toward that longer-term growth rate of the revenues or where we're seeing it projected.  
So again, it's a spend, I want to remind everyone that, that's a spend to really grow that top line revenue for the long term. And so the upfront investment spend, as we've said, with derivatives, as we said before, will have to occur before the actual revenue show up and certainly in '21 while we're planning. So I would say stay tuned. But certainly a portion of that, and I'm hesitant to give you a fixed number right now, will be variable and not occur in '22."

I think we've just seen an incredible demand that began last year. It continues -- it tends to be in single name options. So our education will be focused on the basics first. The educated investor is the one that's in day in, day out, year in, year out. And that's really what we will be targeting. So the responsibleness, the suitability, what derivatives and how derivatives can change the risk profile for investors is really we'll be concentrating on. 
And I think just even recently, we had 730 participants in our series of 21 for '21, which is 21 investment strategies for 2021. It's an incredible amount of turnout early on. So we're gauging the continuation by the interest in education. We're committed to it. So the investment we make is for the long term. And that conversion from straight Delta One trading into derivatives is really where Cboe's effort will be most concentrated. And then, Chris, maybe a little bit on the mix and what we see coming in on various products and how that's different across the uniqueness of our product set."

So in addition to our education efforts, which Ed mentioned, we're also rolling out products. We rolled out retail priority on our EDGX equities market. As Ed mentioned in the script, we had a record volume there above 700 million shares. Retail priority is now 3 -- almost 3% of the entire U.S. equities market because retail investors and those who are facilitating those orders are getting better quality execution. So that's in equities. 
And then as we mentioned also during the script, we're rolling out products of more retail size with Mini VIX futures, Mini-SPX or XSP. We just announced Mini-Russell and we have some other things we're thinking about as well to appeal to this new retail investor base, this new wave of new generation of retail investors. 
So our goal is to empower and educate them about our products across our asset classes to arm them with what they need to be very successful for the long term. That's why we believe this can be sustainable for years to come."

So when I warm up like that, you can tell that we are planning how to re-enter the space, very measured and cautiously. But I could not describe it any better that the importance of the ecosystem, what we see by vibrant derivatives markets, cash settle markets, retail accessible markets, you mentioned ETPs and ETNs, all very important for a successful exposure to crypto.

Thanks for the question there. As we think about that. It's -- we know that -- first of all I'll start off with that medium-term target, and it's not obviously a next year guide because we know that sometimes there's unpredictability in transaction revenue quarter-over-quarter or even a few quarters over time. And so that's why we want to make sure people understood our view over, call it, a medium term. 
And also, it's incredibly consistent with what we've achieved over the last 4 years, as Ed kind of referenced to earlier. I would say that we -- it's going to be a combination. We already laid out the nontransaction revenue growth expectation as far as our proprietary products -- the proprietary market and access capacity fees how we laid that out. Obviously, you have -- for us, you have the SIP, the take plans, which is at best, probably flat. And then you have the remainder being made up on the transaction revenue side. Again, that is over time versus any one period of time. 
So that's, I think, how if you look at the primary drivers of how that looks and what we've achieved. But again, it's -- we're looking to -- as you can just see the math and you do the numbers, is that, look, there's going to be more recurring revenues as we continue to build that. You're seeing a more diversified base. And frankly, it's just -- it's a higher conviction that over time, that we're building that sustainable revenue, and that's how that's growing. And you're going to have the impact of the acquisitions that we talked about, which again, is not in that organic number, but as that rolls into that number over time, again, we feel good about how that continues to grow as well."

I'll start with the first and then invite John and Chris on the ISG, in particular. So prop product segment, I think, if you just take half a step back, and what we discussed primarily for the 3 quarters of last year after the huge volumes and volatility spike in the first quarter, once institutions told us that they're on the sidelines, there's too much uncertainty out there, right? If you think about this, pandemic just being defined U.S. elections on the map, uncertainty there, led to a runoff election, Brexit coming, going, closing, not closing and told us once some of those uncertainties were passed, that there'd be reengagement, that there needs to be, and there's a demand for exposure more broadly in the U.S. market, and that's what we're seeing in January.  
So just basically feeding back directly from those institutional users in their plans and moving forward, and we're seeing that engagement. So that's really not surprising to us. Stressed, I think, maybe your word, probably a little bit too much of a reach. I think we're seeing more broadly interest in short-term moves and volatility. A lot of that led by the volatility in single names. Raising volatility overall. And then if we look at VIX options, we see interest in buying puts. When people realize or investors realize, gosh, that spike, don't think that's sustainable. We saw that last week, and we saw put buying, and sure enough, investors in this cycle tended to be right. 
So we see engagement across now a variety of macro trading cycles, and I like it. The engagement is up and down our proprietary products, led by institutions reengagement. So I don't think I'd call any segment out on not reengaging maybe some slower than others, but it's engagement each and every day. And we like to see what we're seeing in January, I'd love to see that continue. Chris and John, maybe on the ISG question."

So you get data, then access and then managing your portfolio with risks, and we feel like we have a full suite for them to really engage and use our products in a very efficient and effective manner. 
And I'll end with offering unique products, an example would be FLEX there, for instance, which is getting a broad use for target outcome investing.

And in this case, really, there's a tight fit with those acquisitions because what they do is they drive the decision-making process for large institutional investors on that side. This is a long-term trend. It's not a 1-year trend, not a 2-year trend. We're in the middle phases, I'd say, of institutions automating their decision-making processes, especially from complex instruments like those that drive our proprietary product revenues. 
And so automating things like the pricing evaluation process, risk mitigation, margin processes, we're giving tools to institutions to allow them to automate their processes and engage more deeply in our product set. So we see a lot of long-term potential. And remember, we're doing this all the while, while we extract revenues because there's value in the product itself. So not only are people trading more as a result of the ISG products, but the IST products themselves, have value, and they're contributing to our growing base of recurring revenues."

And part of the -- keeping that balance sheet, I'll call it, low leverage is that if there's something that does become attractive that makes sense, we want to make sure we could potentially deploy that capital. 
But absent that, again, the prioritization really hasn't changed. It's a continuing dialogue, again, we have with the Board, we have the management team. You see it reflected in the share repurchase increase, with the confidence and outlook for the stock is growing the repurchase authorization. But again, the prioritization of, look, it's -- we're going to focus on organic initiatives, as we talked about, been the focus of the call today and our guidance going forward. We always continue to have a commitment to that -- an annual dividend increase. We -- again, and then with the share repurchase, as I mentioned, we'll continue to look for that to be opportunistic. And depending on where all those rank -- or excuse me, where that -- the last one, the share repurchase and delevering. I personally don't see as much value in delevering today versus, say, for example, absent anything else, continue to return cash to shareholders.

And so it does certainly play into how we thought about the year and what can be achieved. So having that as a backdrop, we're not using January to inform our entire year and what we're doing, but there's obviously some trends there that we're seeing continue on as Ed talked about, as the rest of the team has talked about from the institutional activity from the retail activity on a go-forward basis in the various products and the various asset classes. 
As far as the investment spend outlook and where do we expect to see the return, how long. And that will vary by each product. As we talked about and Ed mentioned where the investment priorities were with respect to nontransaction revenue growth, European Derivatives buildout, the bids expansion, the retail, the 24/5, the extended trading hours. All of those things are coming more or less online, as we talked about in 2020 and we're in the latter half of 2020. 
And we said, these are investments in '20 for -- in '21 for a '22 kind of more significant growth contribution for revenue. So it's -- I can't go right now and say it's going to happen in this quarter other than there's a possibility that, yes, we're going to expect to see some revenues in '21. But again, it's later in the year. But the real expectation that I think our investment community should have is that it's a '22 revenue growth delivery.
And again, what we're looking to make sure that we're delivering on is, at the end of the day, we're trying to have a secular growth of the business. And again, we see the increasing need for the data and analytics, the need for better access and addressing that demand with a new product, new geography, which again is represented by, I think, the 4 kind of areas that we're prioritizing.
So that's a long-winded way of saying, I'm not going to give you revenue guidance as far as '21 and that we expect to start seeing that in '22 and beyond. And obviously, and this is true probably with most firms. We see a really, really large ROI on organic activities that, especially if we can leverage the existing infrastructure and you leverage the existing network that we have today and really meeting the demand and access capacity that we see a really high ROI, and that's, again, that's a 2 to 3 year look. 
And again, that helps contribute to that medium to long-term growth rate that we talked about upfront."

I'm sure this Chairman and his team will understand that. And I'm looking forward to just some incredibly healthy dialogue. 
So very optimistic going into the change. Chris, operationally, I think what I hope continues is the engagement we've seen in the SEC primarily this year about the lit exchanges and how what an incredible role they've played in maintaining stability in the most uncertain of times.

You've heard Ed and Chris and John talked about the ISG opportunities that are out there from the index services, the historical data sets, to the new data and analytics services and expanding the customer base.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy.We reported solid financial results for the first quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets while continuing to successfully execute on o",1897,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy.
We reported solid financial results for the first quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets while continuing to successfully execute on our strategic growth plan to expand our geographic and asset class footprint, broaden our customer reach, diversify our business mix with recurring revenue and leverage our superior technology. As expected, we have more difficult comparisons this quarter against last year's record first quarter earnings when we saw exceptionally strong trading as the COVID-19 pandemic began sweeping the globe.
For the quarter, net revenue was up 2%, and adjusted earnings per share was down 7% year-over-year. However, we saw very strong sequential growth across business segments, with net revenue up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and adjusted EPS up 26%. Our solid results were driven by record trading in multi-listed options and continued growth in our recurring nontransaction revenues as well as the contribution from the acquisitions we completed in 2020.
I want to update you on the progress we made this year on 4 key incremental growth drivers I highlighted last quarter. Our plans to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, the opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue, our plans to expand BIDS trading and efforts to extend across to our products and services, including retail.
First, I'd like a moment to highlight a few market dynamics we saw during the quarter. With increased certainty around the political landscape, progress around the vaccine rollout, the reopening of businesses in various companies returning to work, we have seen institutional investors reengage with our index options and volatility products this year. Quarter-over-quarter volume increased by 63% in VIX futures, 29% in VIX options and 15% in SPX options. In Europe, our successful Brexit transition and the reintroduction of Swiss trading on our U.K. market helped us achieve some notable records across our suite of European and equity products during the first quarter.
Cboe Europe periodic auctions had record average daily notional value traded of EUR 1.3 billion during the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Additionally, Cboe LIS, our European block trading platform powered by BIDS, had record market share of 24.1%, up from 22.7% market share 1 year ago. As clients have recalibrated their models and readjusted to the new trading landscape in Europe, we're pleased to see that our overall market share has increased to 17.9% month-to-date in April, our highest since July of 2020.
We are maintaining our focus on investing in long-term growth, building on the strong foundation we made last year and are excited about the momentum we are seeing across our business. Last month, we announced plans to acquire Chi-X Asia Pacific, which will find Cboe with a single point of entry into 2 of the world's largest securities markets, Australia and Japan. I'll touch on this exciting deal in a moment. But first, let me update you on key incremental growth drivers I noted earlier and how this planned acquisition complements several of these gross initiatives.
I'll begin with the progress we've made growing nontransaction revenues. During the first quarter, we achieved 17% growth in recurring nontransaction revenues, exceeding our expectations. This increase includes organic growth of 14%. Brian will share additional details later in the call, but we are increasing our 2021 growth target for organic recurring nontransaction revenues to a range of 10% to 11% from a range of 6% to 7%. One of our top priorities remains the continued global expansion of our data analytics offering, and last month, we announced the creation of Cboe Data and Access Solutions, a new division that will lead our charge to become a global leader in data and analytics. Led by Catherine Clay, this new division combines our Information Solutions and Market Data and Access Services teams into 1 group that creates an optimized offering for our global client base. This holistic solution is expected to enable customers around the world to seamlessly access all of Cboe's expanded capabilities, including global indices, interface solutions as well as data, market and risk analytics through a unified offering.
Additionally, in connection with the planned Chi-X acquisition, Cathy will lead our effort to build the first truly global equities market data platform that is expected to offer data from most major markets around the world. We recognize that as the trading environment becomes more globalized, customers want greater seamless market to structure services they require, and our goal is to align our business to address these client needs for global data and analytics. We are excited about the continued evolution of this business and believe the new data and Access Solutions group will create opportunity to further grow our base of recurring nontransaction revenue. Cathy is a tremendous leader with a track record of delivering results, and we're excited for her to lead this team as we look to expand the business and our market data offering globally.
Turning to Cboe Europe Derivatives. Yesterday, we announced plans to go live with this new market on Monday, September 6, subject to regulatory approval. We originally hoped to launch this new venue in June. And while we expect to be operationally ready, the regulatory approval process has taken longer than expected, given this initiative expands our existing clearing capabilities into a new asset class. We are working closely with regulators and continue to have a very constructive engagement with them. Most importantly, we have a critical mass of key market participants ready to support the exchange from day 1, including banks, clearing firms, market makers and proprietary trading firms will help contribute to the provision of liquidity and client order flow in the new market.
The team has worked incredibly hard to achieve our mission of creating a modern, vibrant pan-European derivatives market designed to grow the overall derivatives trading landscape while creating new opportunities for customers to express their investment views and manage their equity exposure. Our pan-European model will help provide market participants with the ability to access a modern on-screen derivatives market from 1 single access point, creating efficiencies in trading and clearing. As previously noted, While our 2021 revenue expectations for European derivatives are modest, we are investing for long-term growth and looking for a gradual revenue build as we gain traction, expand our product offering and unlock the potential we see for considerable growth in this market.
Moving to BIDS trading. We see significant opportunity to leverage the planned Chi-X Asia Pacific acquisition to bring bids industry-leading block trading capabilities to this new geography. With BIDS current network covering major North American and European equity targets, the planned addition of Asia Pacific equities is expected to create a global block trading platform to serve a broader base of customers. The expansion of BIDS into Canada is well underway, alongside Cboe's technology integration of MATCHNow, the Canadian ATS we acquired last year. With BIDS extensive global network of more than 460 buy-side investment managers and sell-side constituents, this innovative platform will play a critical role in achieving Cboe mission of building one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities trading networks.
We also remain committed to extending access to our products and services through product innovation, enhancements of our markets as well as expansion of our customer base, both institutional and retail and made solid progress on this initiative in the first quarter. Last month, we extended equity trading hours on our EDGX Exchange to allow for trading beginning at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and the volume we are handling during this early market session has exceeded our expectations. EDGX is now handling more than 11% of the volume during the early trading session.
Earlier this month, we also received approval from the SEC to launch our innovative periodic auctions in the U.S., paving the way for us to provide customers with an on-exchange alternative to off-exchange electronic block trading by enabling them to trade in size while helping to reduce market impact. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong customer adoption of a related product in Europe, and we're excited to build on its success by providing a new version of this product to the U.S. customer base. This long-awaited approval in the U.S. was the result of our steadfast commitment to improving markets for our customers, and we look forward to launching this offering in the third quarter of this year.
We are also planning to extend global trading hours for VIX and SPX options in the fourth quarter of this year as part of our 24/5 initiative subject to regulatory review. The length of global trading hours will complement our planned entry into Asia Pacific and are designed to help meet growing investor demand for the ability to manage risk more efficiently, react to global macroeconomic events as they are happening and adjust SPX and VIX options positions around the clock.
The uptick in market engagement from retail and institutional investors alike reinforces the importance of our ongoing commitment to education. Our new core derivatives curriculum from the Options Institute has been met with positive feedback from early participants at all experience levels. We've expanded the derivatives education webinar series to include foundational knowledge on options, pricing models and strategies, and we are on track to launch our first set of online demand courses in June to further build understanding of derivative strategies and applications.
Additionally, to meet customer demand for even more learning opportunities, the Options Institute is expected to be launching the adjunct faculty program this June. The program features distinguish practitioners specializing in derivative products operations and risk management, decision theory and research.
Turning now to our plans to acquire Chi-X Asia Pacific. We believe this deal significantly advances our mission to build one of the world's largest global derivatives in securities trading networks, enabling the further expansion of our product offerings to a global network of customers. We believe this exciting investment will complement our North American and European operations and provide a foothold in the key Asia Pacific region, positioning us to become a truly global marketplace for our customers. Chi-X is one of the most successful alternative market operators in Asia Pacific, with core exchange operations in Australia and Japan and a significant sales presence in the region.
Asia Pacific is an untapped market for Cboe, and we are excited about the potential to offer our unique proprietary products and other services to clients in the region. As I noted earlier, the acquisition provides the opportunity for us to expand our global equals business, including bringing BIDS to the region. Dave Howson, President of Cboe's European and Asia Pacific operations will lead our planned expansion into the region, working closely with the Cboe team and Chi-X local management teams.
Chi-X leadership has shown an incredible commitment to innovation across market operations, customer service and technology. And I look forward to leveraging the expertise of the team to expand Cboe's geographic reach, enhance existing capabilities and offer new market solutions to investors in the region. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Chi-X team into the Cboe Global Markets family.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

I hope all of you and your families are remaining safe and healthy.Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 1Q '21 as compared to 1Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted r",1188,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I hope all of you and your families are remaining safe and healthy.
Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 1Q '21 as compared to 1Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.
As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results for the quarter, our third highest quarter on an adjusted EPS basis. Earnings were down compared to last year's record high, but we continue to build on the positive momentum we ended last year with. We also continued to execute on our strategic initiatives and remain laser-focused on building one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks to deliver enhanced value to our customers as well as our shareholders.
Now a quick review of the quarter. Our net revenue increased 2%, with net transaction fees down 7% and recurring non-transaction revenue up 17%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 26%, adjusted EBITDA of $250 million was down 6% and finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.53, down 7% compared to last year's record quarterly results, but up 26% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll just provide summary thoughts. The revenue decline in our Options segment was driven by lower trading volumes in our proprietary products, offset somewhat by a continuation of strong trading in our multi-list adoption, growth in revenue per contract or RPC in our index and multi-listed options and growth in our recurring nontransaction revenue. The increase in North American equities revenue resulted from the addition of BIDS and MATCHNow, which contributed total revenue of $12.4 million. In addition, recurring nontransaction revenue increased nearly $5 million or 16% with organic growth of 15%.
The revenue decline in futures resulted from lower trading volume in fixed futures. The revenue increase in Europe primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP, which contributed $12.1 million. As Ed noted, we achieved some notable records in European equities in the first quarter, underscoring our successful Brexit transition and the reintroduction of Swiss trading on our market and continue to make meaningful progress on the planned launch of European derivatives. Overall, we are very proud of the European results this quarter given the challenging circumstances.
And finally, in FX, the revenue decline was due to lower ADNV, resulting in lower net transaction fees, offset slightly by growth in access and capacity fees. In addition, FX market share grew 80 basis points year-over-year to 16.5%.
While not included in our prior year results, I want to point out that the businesses we acquired in 2020 achieved double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, apart from BIDS, which had tougher conversions, like our other trading venues. We recently published historical volume and revenue capture metrics for EuroCCP, BIDS Trading and MATCHNow, which are available on our website where we post our monthly volume statistics.
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted expenses were about $125 million for the quarter, up 26% against last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% or $8 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits. While first quarter expenses annualized are tracking below our current expense guidance range of $531 million to $539 million, most of the variance is due to timing, so we are reaffirming our previous guidance for 2021 expenses.
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, our plans for 2021 and beyond call for continued investments to drive long-term sustainable growth in our business. We started the year strong, achieving 14% organic growth in recurring nontransaction revenue, well ahead of our targeted growth rate for the year of 6% to 7%. Like prior quarters, most of this growth was driven by additional units or subscriptions versus pricing changes. And as Ed mentioned, we now expect the organic annual growth rate in recurring nontransaction revenue to be 10% to 11% for the year. After incorporating our 2020 acquisitions, we similarly now expect the total annual growth rate for this category to be 11% to 12%, up from our prior guidance of 7% to 8%.
As a reminder, we define recurring non-transaction revenue as access and capacity plus proprietary market data fees. In the aggregate, we continue to expect the acquisitions closed in 2020 to contribute additional annual net revenue growth of 4% to 6% in 2021.
Moving to our expense guidance. As I noted earlier, we continue to expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $531 million to $539 million. Furthermore, I want to reemphasize our plan to invest approximately $24 million to $26 million this year to drive incremental and sustainable long-term organic revenue growth and high conviction, high return opportunities. This includes our European derivatives buildout as well as investments to increase access to our existing products and services, especially growth in our index options and futures by developing, listing and distributing meeting products, enhancing our marketing, education and content and increasing our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors. Keep in mind, our current guidance metrics for 2021 do not include the pending acquisition of Chi-X. We will update our guidance accordingly once that transaction has closed.
Turning now to summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are reaffirming our guidance for depreciation and amortization, effective tax rate on adjusted earnings and CapEx. A quick note on our effective tax rate, which was 27.9% for the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter rate of 27% and at the lower end of our guidance range of 27.5% to 29.5%. We are reaffirming this guidance under the current tax laws. While we are not providing full year guidance on interest expense, absent any additional borrowing and significant changes in LIBOR, our interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be $12 million to $12.5 million, in line with our first quarter expense of $12.3 million.
Moving to capital allocation. Our priorities have not changed as we remain committed to investing in our growth strategy while returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you heard from Ed, our recent acquisitions as well as our pending acquisition of Chi-X underscore our conviction and our ability to deploy capital to help enhance organic growth and strategic value over time, leveraging the robust infrastructure and technology at the core of our strong operating leverage profile. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enable us to return $93 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. We plan to continue being opportunistic with share repurchases. Our leverage ratio was unchanged at 1.4x at March 31 versus year-end 2020. We ended the year with adjusted cash of $264 million, reflecting, in part, higher balances associated with additional regulatory capital, supporting growth in Europe.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

Obviously, the incremental guidance reflects our increased confidence in that growth rate, which was already strong, obviously going in. And as you recall, the growth rate in the fourth quarter was also kind of that kind of near double-digit teen growth rate. I guess, just kind of again, lay out our investment thesis that we talked about at the end of the fourth quarter results and basically, that growth is not accidental. It reflects our strategic approach and that longer-term effort, and it's starting to bear fruits.
When you think about the cash flow generation of the organization and where you deploy that capital, which is again, a common theme that we wanted to make sure we laid out, part of the expense guidance, part of what we were doing with the cash flow, it's not, ""Hey, let's take the extra cash and let's put it in a sock drawer and hope it grows."" What reflect the investment thesis is that our global client base has an increasing need for data and analytics and better access. So as you look at the details of where did that growth come from and what we're seeing, it's 3 parts: it's growth and demand to access to our markets; it's growth and demand to our data; and its growth in demand to our analytics and that suite of products.
On the access side and you look across, primarily, this is coming from the options, North American equities and Europe business, is we're seeing a little bit of the macro effect of that increasing demand, increasing activity, but we're also seeing the feedback that the firms are looking for more and more capacity as they potentially -- as they're expanding their trading capacity. On the data side, we're seeing incremental top of book sales, particularly on the equities front, and 75% of that growth is actually international. There is some U.S., but the top of book sales are coming international. And then in the U.S., we're actually seeing more depth to book, I'll call it, more share of wallet demand coming through.
On the analytics side is -- what we're seeing is that whole analytics suite is starting to come together. We're seeing increased client demand for access or having the same provider. We're seeing growth on the Silexx platform. We're seeing growth in LiveVol, Hanweck with FT options and Trade Alert lot. All of that's coming together from a similar provider. Again, we've talked about this before, pre-trade, at-trade, post-trade, helping provide that risk and net analytics framework is really starting to bear fruit and where this is coming out. So on a go-forward, the increased guidance reflects the strong pipeline and again, confidence in our efforts, and we're just going to continue to leverage our global network, and we're really excited to grow this part of the business."

So we're seeing, again, across all -- again, we can't necessarily point, here's a macro factor, here is the internal kind of the growth driven of the firms themselves. But like I said, as firms have grown this capacity and they continue to execute their trading strategies, you know what, they have not indicated any change. I just said we still feel confident in sustaining that overall level of participation and access into our markets.
So like I said, it's hard to predict the growth rates in any 1 particular quarter. But over time, we still feel pretty good overall. Again, that macro factor, we can't ignore it, but we don't think it was the primary driver of our growth."

That was an effort that we began well over a year ago, and being able to come to market in September is quite exciting. And then taking the incredible leadership that Dave Howson as he shepherded that effort with Edi Cordell in Europe, being able to take Dave's expertise and have him oversee the integration of Chi-X, it makes perfect sense for us on a build-out. But importantly, you can see the effect and the vision that we had with our purchase of BIDS, our partner for years in Europe, being able to move into Canada with our MATCHNow ATS acquisition and then now moving that network and reach into the APAC region. So it's just terrific and putting Brian Harkins in charge of that growth and that rollout, I think we're well positioned to take full advantage of all of the deals that we've expressed to you over the past 18 months.

And we do, I think, on a macro level, this is exactly when institutions have been -- were telling us in the second half of last year. And of course, we were passing that information along to you, and I think no better place to load is that SPX volume is right around 1.2 million contracts a day, very consistent for the first 4 months of the year. What's been interesting is to see the VIX options growth in the first quarter of the year, and that's changed a bit in April. And really, the efficiency of our institutional users who saw an advantage using BIDS options at a time where the difference between realized volatility and implied volatility, buying vol and the exposure of VIX options is relatively cheap. And so we saw institutions in a big way move to using VIX options for hedging purposes. That's changed now in April as we're looking at a more normal realized to implied vol level, so that's exactly the right move from our institution, so really behaving in a very logical way.
And then the overall levels of VIX in the fourth quarter, really around 25.5% or so, second quarter about 23%. And then if you take out today, right around 20% or just below 20%. So moving to a more normal contango shape which should kick in the roll down trade that we've seen in years past, so this is exactly what we expect out of our institutions, and no reason to think that won't continue. So I appreciate that question."

We saw actually more than 100% growth in that segment in SPX options last year, year-over-year. And so we're excited that as we increase the access, so will the volume come.
As a bit of a precursor to that, we extended our U.S. equities hours to 4:00 a.m. Eastern, opening up 3 hours earlier.

So the rotation to smaller ore side, the rotation of more traditional retail is what you see today and at roughly 1.2 million contracts a day, and we're still working on providing access to new retail which we think the more you look at our Mini products and the more we allow or they allow access for their clients into SPX, you -- I would predict that you'll see a movement like a traditional retail out of new retail. So that's our goal, but that's what we're seeing today. That's the biggest change I can tell you is Chi-X."

I actually like the momentum, particularly out of retail that we've kind of been spending some time on. Not surprisingly, individual names, the attention that individual trading has had has raised vol across the spectrum. So if you're providing that liquidity in the most volatile single names, you're looking for macro layoff as best you can that had raised the interest for us and what we saw in AUM and ETPs. We saw that in VIX options. As I said before, The -- you really we're buying implied volatility at discount of what the market was trading at, that's since gone to a more normal relationship, again, if we put today out of the mix. But then what we would expect traditionally is if that volume -- I'm sorry, if that vol went to a more historical contango shape, we'll see the roll down. We should see the roll down trade again.
So from our proprietary product perspective, we just see that as a normal rotation. The single name excitement being replaced with more macro as vol contracts a bit and then going back to a short vol capture trade or roll down trade and going back to a more normal cadence. But it will be interesting to see. I think the uniqueness of Cboe is having a product for any market environment, and that's not different. So again -- and let me -- 1 more comment on retail. We're after sustainable volume in retail. There's going to be flashes, and we're going to have headlines. It's going to be interesting stories and shiny objects in the corner. We're after what education can provide in for the long-term investor and the retail investment that's going to be here year in, year out. So we don't really chase those spikes, we chase sustainable growth. And that's what we're after. So I appreciate that."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy. 
We reported solid financial results for the first quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets while continuing to successfully execute on our strategic growth plan to expand our geographic and asset class footprint, broaden our customer reach, diversify our business mix with recurring revenue and leverage our superior technology. 
As expected, we have more difficult comparisons this quarter against last year's record first quarter earnings when we saw exceptionally strong trading as the COVID-19 pandemic began sweeping the globe. For the quarter, net revenue was up 2%, and adjusted earnings per share was down 7% year-over-year. However, we saw very strong sequential growth across business segments, with net revenue up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and adjusted EPS up 26%. 
Our solid results were driven by record trading in multi-listed options and continued growth in our recurring nontransaction revenues as well as the contribution from the acquisitions we completed in 2020. 
I want to update you on the progress we made this year on 4 key incremental growth drivers I highlighted last quarter. Our plans to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, the opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue, our plans to expand BIDS trading, and efforts to extend across to our products and services, including retail. 
First, I'd like a moment to highlight a few market dynamics we saw during the quarter. With increased certainty around the political landscape, progress around the vaccine rollout, the reopening of businesses and various companies returning to work, we have seen institutional investors reengage with our index options and volatility products this year. Quarter-over-quarter volume increased by 63% in VIX futures, 29% in VIX options, and 15% in SPX options. In Europe, our successful Brexit transition and the reintroduction of Swiss trading on our U.K. market helped us achieve some notable records across our suite of European and equity products during the first quarter. 
Cboe Europe periodic auctions had record average daily notional value traded of EUR 1.3 billion during the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Additionally, Cboe LIS, our European block trading platform powered by BIDS, had record market share of 24.1%, up from 22.7% market share 1 year ago. As clients have recalibrated their models and readjusted to the new trading landscape in Europe, we're pleased to see that our overall market share has increased to 17.9% month-to-date in April, our highest since July of 2020. 
We are maintaining our focus on investing in long-term growth, building on the strong foundation we'd laid last year and are excited about the momentum we are seeing across our business. Last month, we announced plans to acquire Chi-X Asia Pacific, which will provide Cboe with a single point of entry into 2 of the world's largest securities markets, Australia and Japan. I'll touch on this exciting deal in a moment. But first, let me update you on key incremental growth drivers I noted earlier and how this planned acquisition complements several of these growth initiatives. 
I'll begin with the progress we've made growing nontransaction revenues. During the first quarter, we achieved 17% growth in recurring nontransaction revenues, exceeding our expectations. This increase includes organic growth of 14%. Brian will share additional details later in the call, but we are increasing our 2021 growth target for organic recurring nontransaction revenues to a range of 10% to 11% from a range of 6% to 7%. 
One of our top priorities remains the continued global expansion of our data analytics offering, and last month, we announced the creation of Cboe Data and Access Solutions, a new division that will lead our charge to become a global leader in data and analytics. Led by Catherine Clay, this new division combines our Information Solutions and Market Data and Access Services teams into one group that creates an optimized offering for our global client base. This holistic solution is expected to enable customers around the world to seamlessly access all of Cboe's expanded capabilities, including global indices, interface solutions as well as data, market and risk analytics through a unified offering. 
Additionally, in connection with the planned Chi-X acquisition, Cathy will lead our effort to build the first truly global equities market data platform that is expected to offer data from most major markets around the world. 
We recognize that as the trading environment becomes more globalized, customers want greater efficiency in the market infrastructure services they require, and our goal is to align our business to address these client needs for global data and analytics. We are excited about the continued evolution of this business and believe the new data and Access Solutions group will create opportunity to further grow our base of recurring nontransaction revenue. Cathy is a tremendous leader with a track record of delivering results, and we're excited for her to lead this team as we look to expand the business and our market data offering globally. 
Turning to Cboe Europe Derivatives. Yesterday, we announced plans to go live with this new market on Monday, September 6, subject to regulatory approval. We originally hoped to launch this new venue in June. And while we expect to be operationally ready, the regulatory approval process has taken longer than expected, given this initiative expands our existing clearing capabilities into a new asset class. We are working closely with regulators and continue to have a very constructive engagement with them. Most importantly, we have a critical mass of key market participants ready to support the exchange from day 1, including banks, clearing firms, market makers and proprietary trading firms will help contribute to the provision of liquidity and client order flow in the new market. 
The team has worked incredibly hard to achieve our mission of creating a modern, vibrant pan-European derivatives market designed to grow the overall derivatives trading landscape while creating new opportunities for customers to express their investment views and manage their equity exposure. Our pan-European model will help provide market participants with the ability to access a modern on-screen derivatives market from one single access point, creating efficiencies in trading and clearing. 
As previously noted, while our 2021 revenue expectations for European derivatives are modest, we are investing for long-term growth and looking for a gradual revenue build as we gain traction, expand our product offering and unlock the potential we see for considerable growth in this market. 
Moving to BIDS Trading. We see significant opportunity to leverage the planned Chi-X Asia Pacific acquisition to bring BIDS' industry-leading block trading capabilities to this new geography. With BIDS' current network covering major North American and European equity targets, the planned addition of Asia Pacific equities is expected to create a global block trading platform to serve a broader base of customers. The expansion of BIDS into Canada is well underway, alongside Cboe's technology integration of MATCHNow, the Canadian ATS we acquired last year. With BIDS' extensive global network of more than 460 buy-side investment managers and sell-side constituents, this innovative platform will play a critical role in achieving Cboe's mission of building one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities trading networks. 
We also remain committed to extending access to our products and services through product innovation, enhancements of our markets as well as expansion of our customer base, both institutional and retail, and made solid progress on this initiative in the first quarter. Last month, we extended equity trading hours on our EDGX Exchange to allow for trading beginning at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and the volume we are handling during this early market session has exceeded our expectations. EDGX is now handling more than 11% of the volume during the early trading session. 
Earlier this month, we also received approval from the SEC to launch our innovative periodic auctions in the U.S., paving the way for us to provide customers with an on-exchange alternative to off-exchange electronic block trading by enabling them to trade in size while helping to reduce market impact. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong customer adoption of a related product in Europe, and we're excited to build on its success by providing a new version of this product to the U.S. customer base. This long-awaited approval in the U.S. was the result of our steadfast commitment to improving markets for our customers, and we look forward to launching this offering in the third quarter of this year. 
We are also planning to extend global trading hours for VIX and SPX options in the fourth quarter of this year as part of our 24x5 initiative, subject to regulatory review. The length of global trading hours will complement our planned entry into Asia Pacific and are designed to help meet growing investor demand for the ability to manage risk more efficiently, react to global macroeconomic events as they are happening and adjust SPX and VIX options positions around the clock. 
The uptick in market engagement from retail and institutional investors alike reinforces the importance of our ongoing commitment to education. Our new core derivatives curriculum from the Options Institute has been met with positive feedback from early participants at all experience levels. We've expanded the derivatives education webinar series to include foundational knowledge on options, pricing models and strategies, and we are on track to launch our first set of online demand courses in June to further build understanding of derivative strategies and applications. 
Additionally, to meet customer demand for even more learning opportunities, the Options Institute is expected to be launching the Adjunct Faculty Program this June. The program features distinguish practitioners specializing in derivative products, operations and risk management, decision theory and research. 
Turning now to our plans to acquire Chi-X Asia Pacific. We believe this deal significantly advances our mission to build one of the world's largest global derivatives in securities trading networks, enabling the further expansion of our product offerings to a global network of customers. We believe this exciting investment will complement our North American and European operations and provide a foothold in the key Asia Pacific region, positioning us to become a truly global marketplace for our customers. Chi-X is one of the most successful alternative market operators in Asia Pacific, with core exchange operations in Australia and Japan and a significant sales presence in the region. Asia Pacific is an untapped market for Cboe and we are excited about the potential to offer our unique proprietary products and other services to clients in the region. 
As I noted earlier, the acquisition provides the opportunity for us to expand our global equities business, including bringing BIDS to the region. Dave Howson, President of Cboe's European and Asia Pacific Operations, will lead our planned expansion into the region, working closely with the Cboe team and Chi-X local management teams. 
Chi-X leadership has shown an incredible commitment to innovation across market operations, customer service and technology. And I look forward to leveraging the expertise of the team to expand Cboe's geographic reach, enhance existing capabilities and offer new market solutions to investors in the region. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Chi-X team into the Cboe Global Markets family. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

I hope all of you and your families are remaining safe and healthy. 
Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 1Q '21 as compared to 1Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. 
As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results for the quarter, our third highest quarter on an adjusted EPS basis. Earnings were down compared to last year's record high, but we continued to build on the positive momentum we ended last year with. We also continued to execute on our strategic initiatives and remain laser-focused on building one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks to deliver enhanced value to our customers as well as our shareholders. 
Now a quick review of the quarter. Our net revenue increased 2% with net transaction fees down 7% and recurring nontransaction revenue up 17%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 26%. Adjusted EBITDA of $250 million was down 6%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.53, down 7% compared to last year's record quarterly results, but up 26% quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll just provide summary thoughts. 
The revenue decline in our Options segment was driven by lower trading volumes in our proprietary products, offset somewhat by a continuation of strong trading in our multi-listed options, growth in revenue per contract or RPC in our index and multi-listed options, and growth in our recurring nontransaction revenue. The increase in North American equities revenue resulted from the addition of BIDS and MATCHNow, which contributed total revenue of $12.4 million. 
In addition, recurring nontransaction revenue increased nearly $5 million or 16%, with organic growth of 15%.
The revenue decline in Futures resulted from lower trading volume in fixed futures. The revenue increase in Europe primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP, which contributed $12.1 million. As Ed noted, we achieved some notable records in European equities in the first quarter, underscoring our successful Brexit transition and the reintroduction of Swiss trading on our market, and continued to make meaningful progress on the planned launch of European derivatives. Overall, we are very proud of the European results this quarter given the challenging circumstances. 
And finally, in FX, the revenue decline was due to lower ADNV, resulting in lower net transaction fees, offset slightly by growth in access and capacity fees. In addition, FX market share grew 80 basis points year-over-year to 16.5%.
While not included in our prior year results, I want to point out that the businesses we acquired in 2020 achieved double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, apart from BIDS, which had tougher conversions, like our other trading venues. We recently published historical volume and revenue capture metrics for EuroCCP, BIDS Trading and MATCHNow, which are available on our website where we post our monthly volume statistics.
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted expenses were about $125 million for the quarter, up 26% against last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% or $8 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits. While first quarter expenses annualized are tracking below our current expense guidance range of $531 million to $539 million, most of the variance is due to timing, so we are reaffirming our previous guidance for 2021 expenses.
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, our plans for 2021 and beyond call for continued investments to drive long-term sustainable growth in our business. We started the year strong, achieving 14% organic growth in recurring nontransaction revenue, well ahead of our targeted growth rate for the year of 6% to 7%. Like prior quarters, most of this growth was driven by additional units or subscriptions versus pricing changes. And as Ed mentioned, we now expect the organic annual growth rate in recurring nontransaction revenue to be 10% to 11% for the year. After incorporating our 2020 acquisitions, we similarly now expect the total annual growth rate for this category to be 11% to 12%, up from our prior guidance of 7% to 8%.
As a reminder, we define recurring nontransaction revenue as access and capacity plus proprietary market data fees. In the aggregate, we continue to expect the acquisitions closed in 2020 to contribute additional annual net revenue growth of 4% to 6% in 2021.
Moving to our expense guidance. As I noted earlier, we continue to expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $531 million to $539 million. Furthermore, I want to reemphasize our plan to invest approximately $24 million to $26 million this year to drive incremental and sustainable long-term organic revenue growth and high-conviction, high-return opportunities. This includes our European derivatives buildout as well as investments to increase access to our existing products and services, especially growth in our index options and futures by developing, listing and distributing unique products, enhancing our marketing, education and content and increasing our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors. Keep in mind, our current guidance metrics for 2021 do not include the pending acquisition of Chi-X. We will update our guidance accordingly once that transaction has closed.
Turning now to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are reaffirming our guidance for depreciation and amortization, effective tax rate on adjusted earnings and CapEx. 
A quick note on our effective tax rate, which was 27.9% for the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter rate of 27% and at the lower end of our guidance range of 27.5% to 29.5%. We are reaffirming this guidance under the current tax laws. 
While we are not providing full year guidance on interest expense, absent any additional borrowing and significant changes in LIBOR, our interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be $12 million to $12.5 million, in line with our first quarter expense of $12.3 million.
Moving to capital allocation. Our priorities have not changed as we remain committed to investing in our growth strategy while returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you heard from Ed, our recent acquisitions as well as our pending acquisition of Chi-X underscore our conviction and our ability to deploy capital to help enhance organic growth and strategic value over time, leveraging the robust infrastructure and technology at the core of our strong operating leverage profile. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $93 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. We plan to continue being opportunistic with share repurchases. 
Our leverage ratio was unchanged at 1.4x at March 31 versus year-end 2020. We ended the year with adjusted cash of $264 million, reflecting, in part, higher balances associated with additional regulatory capital, supporting growth in Europe.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

Obviously, the incremental guidance reflects our increased confidence in that growth rate, which was already strong, obviously going in. And as you recall, the growth rate in the fourth quarter was also kind of that kind of near double-digit teen growth rate. 
I guess, just kind of again, lay out our investment thesis that we talked about at the end of the fourth quarter results. And basically, that growth is not accidental. It reflects our strategic approach and that longer-term effort, and it's starting to bear fruits.
When you think about the cash flow generation of the organization and where you deploy that capital, which is again, a common theme that we wanted to make sure we laid out, part of the expense guidance, part of what we were doing with the cash flow, it's not, ""Hey, let's take the extra cash and let's put it in a sock drawer and hope it grows."" 
What reflect the investment thesis is that our global client base has an increasing need for data and analytics and better access. So as you look at the details of where did that growth come from and what we're seeing, it's 3 parts: it's growth in demand to access to our markets; it's growth in demand to our data; and its growth in demand to our analytics and that suite of products.
On the access side and you look across -- primarily, this is coming from the options, North American equities and Europe business, is we're seeing a little bit of the macro effect of that increasing demand, increasing activity. But we're also seeing the feedback that the firms are looking for more and more capacity as they potentially -- as they're expanding their trading capacity. 
On the data side, we're seeing incremental top of book sales, particularly on the equities front, and 75% of that growth is actually international. There is some U.S., but the top of book sales are coming international. And then in the U.S., we're actually seeing more depth to book, I'll call it, more share of wallet demand coming through.
On the analytics side is -- what we're seeing is that whole analytics suite is starting to come together. We're seeing increased client demand for access or having the same provider. We're seeing growth on the Silexx platform. We're seeing growth in LiveVol, Hanweck, FT Options and Trade Alert. All of that's coming together from a similar provider. 
Again, we've talked about this before, pre-trade, at-trade, post-trade, helping provide that risk -- that analytics framework is really starting to bear fruit and where this is coming out. 
So on a go-forward, the increased guidance reflects the strong pipeline and again, confidence in our efforts. And we're just going to continue to leverage our global network, and we're really excited to grow this part of the business."

As for the other M&A, you noticed in the core business of us matching trades, if a region is open for competition, that makes sense for us to take a hard look at.

So we're seeing, again, across all -- again, we can't necessarily point, here's a macro factor, here is the internal kind of the growth driven of the firms themselves. But like I said, as firms have grown this capacity and they continue to execute their trading strategies, you know what, they have not indicated any change. Like I said, we still feel confident in sustaining that overall level of participation and access into our markets.

And I think no better place to look as that SPX volume is right around 1.2 million contracts a day, very consistent for the first 4 months of the year. What's been interesting is to see the VIX options growth in the first quarter of the year, and that's changed a bit in April. And really, the efficiency of our institutional users who saw an advantage using VIX options at a time where the difference between realized volatility and implied volatility, buying vol and the exposure of VIX options is relatively cheap. And so we saw institutions in a big way move to using VIX options for hedging purposes. That's changed now in April as we're looking at a more normal realized to implied vol level, so that's exactly the right move from our institution, so really behaving in a very logical way.
And then the overall levels of VIX in the fourth quarter, really around 25.5% or so, second quarter about 23%. And then if you take out today, right around 20% or just below 20%. So moving to a more normal contango shape, which should kick in the roll down trade that we've seen in years past. So this is exactly what we expect out of our institutions, and no reason to think that won't continue. So I appreciate that question."

We already trade VIX futures 24x5, and this will get us to nearly 24x5 for SPX and VIX options. And we call this global trading hours outside of the U.S. hours. We saw actually more than 100% growth in that segment in SPX options last year, year-over-year. And so we're excited that as we increase the access, so will the volume come.
As a bit of a precursor to that, we extended our U.S. equities hours to 4:00 a.m. Eastern, opening up 3 hours earlier. And we've seen quite an uptick in number of customers and our market share coming there, kind of exceeding our expectations.

I'd also mention we -- the way in which we're getting to customers, we want to make sure we get to not just the existing customers with more well-packaged data in a way that they can act upon, but actually new customers that may not have current access using the normal means that you might have. So also, it's exploration of efforts to use the cloud and whatnot to get to new customers. 
So we have an incredible amount of data, a unique position now when we hopefully close the Chi-X Asia acquisition, this global derivatives and securities network with just an unparalleled amount of data coming from the equity platforms, put that together with our deep analytics, and we're very excited about this.

But what has been missing in the SPX, the VIX options, our Mini futures, XSP, our Mini-SPX and what we're looking at is to accommodate new retail, which still does not have access to our proprietary product set. So the rotation to smaller order size, the rotation of more traditional retail is what you see today and at roughly 1.2 million contracts a day, and we're still working on providing access to new retail which we think the more you look at our Mini products and the more we allow or they allow access for their clients into SPX, you -- I would predict that you'll see a movement like a traditional retail out of new retail.

I actually like the momentum, particularly out of retail that we've kind of been spending some time on. 
Not surprisingly, individual names, the attention that individual trading has had has raised vol across the spectrum. So if you're providing that liquidity in the most volatile single names, you're looking for macro layoff as best you can. That had raised the interest for us and what we saw in AUM and ETPs. We saw that in VIX options, as I said before. The -- really, we're buying implied volatility at discount of what the market was trading at. That's since gone to a more normal relationship, again, if we put today out of the mix. 
But then what we would expect traditionally is if that volume -- I'm sorry, if that vol went to a more historical contango shape, we'll see the roll down. We should see the roll down trade again.
So from our proprietary product perspective, we just see that as a normal rotation. The single name excitement being replaced with more macro as vol contracts a bit. And then going back to a short vol capture trade or roll down trade and going back to a more normal cadence. But it will be interesting to see. I think the uniqueness of Cboe is having a product for any market environment, and that's not different.

I hope that you're doing well and remaining safe and healthy. 
Our purpose is to operate a trusted and inclusive global marketplace supported by our guiding principles, which include active transparency. It is in this spirit that we issued a press release this morning regarding spot volatility indices, and I want to comment on that before I dive into the results for the quarter. 
As outlined in the press release, we recently discovered instances where the spot VIX index calculation differs from the calculation described in VIX white paper, which details the formulas used for driving values related to VIX. Specifically, in certain instances, an index level was not produced at the  interval resulting in the dissemination of the prior index value. These instances relate only to the spot index, which is not a tradable product. We believe that VIX tradable futures and options as well as the NAV products that track the daily closing prices, such as volatility ETP products were not impacted. In addition, the calculation of the final settlement value for expiring VIX derivatives, which uses an independent process, was not impacted. We are investigating the degree of impact and the number of instances with respect to which the redissemination occurred. Based on our initial assessment, we believe that the vast majority of cases of the current VIX index calculation yielded the same result is provided in the VIX white paper. 
Now turning to Slide 5. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets. We continue to deliver on our strategic growth plan, expanding on the foundation we made over the last year as we build one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities trading networks. For the quarter, we reported year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring nontransaction revenues, with net revenue up 18% to over $350 million and adjusted EPS up 5%. 
Our solid results were driven by continued growth in recurring nontransaction revenues, increased trading volumes and engagement of institutional clients trading our index options and volatility products. We saw strong year-over-year growth in our proprietary products. ADV increased by 40% in VIX futures, 41% in VIX options and 8% in SPX options. 
During the second quarter, we made excellent progress executing on the 4 key incremental growth drivers I outlined at the beginning of this year. The opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue; the upcoming planned launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives; our expansion plans for BIDS trading; and extending access to our products and services across geographies and market participants. July 1, we also closed our acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific. We are very excited to further expand in this new region, and I'll share more about our plans later in the call. 
First, I'll touch on the solid rules of our recurring nontransaction revenue, powered by our data and access solutions business. Similar to the first quarter, we exceeded our growth targets, achieving 21% growth during the second quarter. This increase included organic growth of 19% year-over-year, which was fueled by an equal contribution from both proprietary market data fees and access and capacity fees. As a result of this continued strong performance, we are increasing our 2021 organic growth target for recurring nontransaction revenue to a range of 12% to 13% from a range of 10% to 11%. The growth in nontransaction revenue was driven by new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms, such as Silexx, LiveVol Pro and Trade Alert as well as demand for logical ports and market data as customers look to gain global market access. 
Our Data and Access Solutions business provides a suite of data analytics, market intelligence and execution services, allowing us to interact with and add value for market participants at every step of the trade process. Later this year, we plan to launch Cboe Global Data Cloud, which will provide cloud distribution for certain data products, creating a simple, efficient way for customers to access our data. Our goal is to optimize the efficiency and delivery of our data and access solutions to market participants across the globe. We believe the acquisition of Chi-X creates a tremendous opportunity for this business. 
Turning to Europe. I'm pleased to report that we received regulatory approvals this month to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, and we are on track to go live with this new market on September 6. We have key market participants ready to support the exchange from day 1, including banks, clearing firms, market makers and proprietary trading firms, will help contribute to the provision of liquidity in client order flow. 
I'm incredibly proud of our team and their dedication over the last 18 months, working remotely from their homes to develop this new market designed to address the diverse needs of our customers. We believe that market participants will find tremendous benefit in being able to access a truly pan-European, transparent, efficient and lit derivatives market. 
Our overall business in Europe was exceptionally strong in the second quarter, and we expect the launch of Cboe Europe derivatives to build on this momentum. As we said before, we see a significant opportunity to grow the overall derivatives market in Europe. We are not aiming simply to take market share from incumbent exchanges. We intend to reshape and expand derivatives trading across Europe with a novel market structure designed to attract both new and existing participants. We're excited to get started doing just that in September. 
Moving to BIDS Trading. Last month, we announced plans to launch a bb LIS, powered by BIDS in Canada in February 2022. Based on our highly successful offering in Europe, our Canadian LIS offering, which is subject to regulatory approval, will combine the industry-leading block trading capabilities from MATCHNow, the Canadian alternative trading system Cboe acquired last year and BIDS, to create an enhanced market center for block-size liquidity. The launch of BIDS in Canada will be coupled with the planned migration of Cboe technology, further extending our world-class trading platform. BIDS has established itself as the premier block trading destination in the U.S. and Europe, and we are excited about our plans to expand the BIDS network to Canada and Asia Pacific, first into Australia and then Japan, to serve even a broader base of customers. 
As we broaden our global footprint by entering new markets and launching new products and services, we further our goal of expanding access to a broader base of customers, both institutional and retail. Last month, we announced our November 21 launch for our extended global trading hours for VIX and SPX options as part of our 24/5 initiatives, subject to regulatory review. The length in global trading hours will complement our entry into Asia Pacific with the Chi-X acquisition and are designed to help meet growing investor demand for the ability to manage risk more efficiently, react to global macroenomic events as they happen and adjust SPX Index options positions around the clock. 
We've seen steady growth this year in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms as retail engagement across the market continues. Monthly ADV and SPX options on retail platforms has increased more than 50% since the start of the year. We've also continued to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV increasing 11% year-over-year in the second quarter. We see opportunity with the growing retail audience and remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. 
Product innovation remains a core focus of Cboe franchise, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our proprietary product offering with smaller contract sizes that appeal to both retail traders and institutional investors. Enhancing and expanding our educational offering from the Options Institute remains a top priority. Last quarter, the Options Institute hosted numerous webcasts and training sessions for market participants and also launched a new learning management system for retail and institutional investors looking to learn more about derivatives. We are currently demoing this system with clients and plan to make it available for on-demand online education later this year. 
Additionally, we've cultivated an expert team of derivative specialists to serve as agile faculty and structures for the Options Institute and look forward to hosting classes beginning this fall. These distinguished practitioner specialize in derivatives products, operations and risk management, decision theory and research, and we look forward to engaging with and educating investors on the benefits derivatives can provide to their investment portfolios. 
And last, we closed our acquisition of Chi-X at the beginning of July, enabling us to establish a significant presence in the Asia Pacific region. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment in our corporate evolution. We are now a truly global market infrastructure provider, operating markets and delivering products and services around the world every day of the week and around the clock. We plan to migrate Chi-X to Cboe technology over time, and the team is busy working through the integration plan and time line. Offering one unified technology platform will help provide market participants greater access to Cboe's diverse product set and more efficiency, resiliency and functionality when trading across Cboe's markets. 
As we move forward, we see a significant opportunity to expand our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products into one of the world's largest and most comprehensive global derivatives and securities networks. We have proven ourselves as a nimble and efficient operators of securities markets around the globe. But more importantly, we see securities markets as the foundational element in creating products and services that span the equities and derivatives landscape. Our transactional expertise allows us to create, package and distribute a host of market data, analytics and index products. 
Having recognized benchmark indices allows us in turn to develop additional tradable products and new markets for these products to trade, creating a virtuous cycle of transaction and nontransaction product growth at Cboe. You only have to look at the success of Cboe Europe, which started out as a small equity market and is now on the cusp of launching a pan-European derivatives market to realize the power and potential of these relationships. 
I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter, and I want to thank all Cboe employees for their hard work and also welcome Chi-X to Cboe's family. We look forward to delivering enhanced value to our customers and our shareholders as we broaden our global network and access to Cboe's unique products and services. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results",1379,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. 
As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results for the quarter, seeing solid contributions from our proprietary trading products as well as our Data and Access Solutions. Earnings in the second quarter increased on a year-over-year basis as we build a more balanced and diversified company. We remain steadfast in our efforts to become one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks, enhancing value to our customers as well as our shareholders. 
Now a quick review of the quarter. Our net revenue increased 18%, net transaction fees were up 19% and recurring nontransaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 34%. Adjusted EBITDA of $234 million was up 11%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.38, up 5% compared to last year's quarterly results. 
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide some thoughts. The revenue increase in our Options segment, which accounted for a majority of our total net revenue growth, was driven by higher trading volumes in both our proprietary and multi-listed options. Total options ADV was up 12%, as we saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. 
Revenue per contract also moved higher by 5%, given positive mix shift to index products and a strong increase in our multi-listed options, RPC, up 31%. And we continue to benefit from solid growth in recurring nontransaction revenue, particularly accessing capacity fees in the segment. 
North American equities revenue decreased 2% year-over-year as industry equity volumes in the U.S. declined by 15%, and Cboe's market share trended lower, primarily reflecting incremental share going off exchange. While our overall market share has trended lower, our continuous trading market share has held up relatively well, and we are optimistic about the many innovations we have introduced and plan to introduce to the market, including retail priority, depletion protection, earlier trading hours and periodic auctions. The volume declines in 2Q were partially offset by a $10 million contribution from BIDS and MATCHNow for the quarter. Lastly, recurring nontransaction revenue increased by more than $4 million or 15% with organic growth of 14%. 
Second quarter revenue increased in futures by 31% on the back of a 49% increase in ADV. The revenue increase in Europe primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP, which contributed $11.7 million during the quarter and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation. Underlying trends are strong and the business's average daily notional value traded on Cboe European equities was up 16%, outpacing the broader market's 5% increase.  capture also rose 7% during the quarter. And finally, the 1% net revenue growth in FX was a result of slightly higher trading activity. 
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $128 million for the quarter, up 34% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions over less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 16% or $16 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits. 
Cboe's recurring nontransaction revenue momentum accelerated in the second quarter with year-over-year organic growth reaching 19%. Again, the strong growth was largely a product of additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we are seeing both physical and logical port usage has accelerated in our equities and options businesses, driven by increased demand for trading capacity. 
On the market data side, we have seen equities also performing well as the strength of Cboe 1 and top of book products have driven market data growth, both domestically and internationally. We are excited to build on our strong organic growth trends with the addition of Chi-X and its revenue basis is approximately 2/3 recurring in nature. 
We are increasing our organic growth outlook by 2 percentage points to 12% to 13% as we factor in the Chi-X contribution. Our total nontransaction revenue growth is now expected to reach 15% to 16% for 2021, up 4 percentage points versus our prior expectation. Overall, our recurring nontransaction revenue businesses remain a critical component of the Cboe growth story and one that we expect to continue to accelerate and diversify our revenue stream over time. 
Moving to our expense guidance. We are reaffirming our full year range of $531 million to $539 million. Importantly, our unchanged guidance range now includes the full impact of Chi-X, an incremental $13 million, which is expected to be completely offset by expense reductions related to COVID-19 in 2020 and have continued into 2021 longer than we initially expected; a reduction in facilities overlap given our ability to expand space in one of our existing locations; and lower compensation expenses due to hiring at a slower pace than we initially expected within both our core operating expenses as well as some of our strategic growth initiatives. Note that we expect the incremental Chi-X expenses to be more than offset by incremental revenues. We expect our expense spend to increase sequentially in 3Q and 4Q, and we expect to see positive returns for the investments we're making. Specifically, our investments reflect our plan to increase access to our existing products and services, especially growth in our index options and futures by developing listing and distributing unique products, enhancing our marketing, education and content and increasing our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors. 
Turning now to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are lowering our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $34 million to $38 million from $38 million to $42 million. Our CapEx guidance range moves $5 million lower to $55 million to $60 million. And while our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.1%, above last year's rate of 26.7% and above our guided range of 27.5% to 29.5%. We are reaffirming the guidance for the full year under the current tax laws. However, we now expect the adjusted -- effective tax rate for the full year to be at the higher end of the guidance range given where we are in 2021 2Q. 
While we are not providing full year guidance on interest expense, we note that we drew an additional $110 million on our term loan credit agreement at the end of the second quarter to fund a portion of the Chi-X deal. Going forward, absent any additional borrowing and significant changes to LIBOR, our interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 is expected to be $11.5 million to $12 million, slightly below our second quarter expense of $12.3 million, reflecting more favorable rates associated with amendments to our term loan facility and EuroCCP credit facility that were effective late June and early July, respectively. 
In addition to the investment priorities we outlined earlier in the call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $79 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. We plan to continue to use our share repurchase capacity opportunistically. 
Our leverage ratio increased slightly versus the quarter to 1.5x at June 30 as a result of the additional term loan financing used to partially fund the Chi-X acquisition. Overall, our balance sheet remains unencumbered as we look at the incremental capital use in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders. 
In summary, we are pleased to report solid 2Q results. We are even more excited about the momentum we carry into the remainder of this year with an increase in guidance for our nontransaction revenue growth rate overall and importantly, organic and our unchanged expense guidance range despite the addition of Chi-X expenses. We believe we have made and expect to continue to make investments that are set to deliver and increase value to our shareholders. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

Before we turn to Q&A, I wanted to quickly highlight a couple of important corporate developments. 
As we accelerate our growth and operations on a global scale, we remain focused on our environmental footprint, social responsibilities and opportunities to make a difference in the communities in which we live and work. To that end, last month, we announced a new community engagement program, Cboe Empowers. This program provides mentorship, scholarships and guidance to under-resource students through their educational journey from elementary school to career. Cboe Empowers is our most ambitious philanthropic endeavor to date. We couldn't be more excited to help equip the next generation with opportunity to realize the career choices available to them as they embark on building their future. Additional information about this exciting program as well as some of the other important initiatives we are focused on regarding environmental, social and corporate governance is included in our recently published ESG report. We are committed to doing our part to help ensure we are tackling the important challenges of our global community is facing today and in the future. 
I'd also like to take a minute to express my immense gratitude to Debbie Koopman for her service to Cboe as she will be retiring in November. During her 13 years with us, she has built Cboe's Investor Relations program from the ground up, played a major role in our transition to a public company through our successful IPO in 2010 and has been pivotal in the execution of our acquisition strategy. She has helped shape and communicate Cboe's vision and mission to the investment community, developing strong relationships with our shareholders, potential investors and research analysts. I have always appreciated her sharp wit, tough questions, friendship and indelible laugh, and we'll miss working with her. 
We are thrilled to have Ken Hill succeeding Debbie as Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken joined us last month and is working closely with Debbie to ensure a smooth transition. His experience and expertise in capital markets makes him a perfect fit for this role. We wish Debbie all the best in her retirement. 
I'll now pass it back to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

So we do love this question, Rich. And so I'll just kind of reiterate a couple of things. One, on the Access capacity. We've kind of seen that strength all year long, again, reflecting, like I said, accelerated demand for basically overall capacity t",372,"Yes. So we do love this question, Rich. And so I'll just kind of reiterate a couple of things. One, on the Access capacity. We've kind of seen that strength all year long, again, reflecting, like I said, accelerated demand for basically overall capacity to access our markets, again, showing the quality and depth and what we're doing there. And again, that is across the board. That is options, equities. Europe, actually the strongest on a pure growth rate is European equities. From an overall contribution, it's still coming from the options business as well as North American equities. 
On the market data side, the -- I would say a couple of things I want to hit there as well is that I hinted that that growth is actually coming also internationally and domestically. If we look at just the market data growth, we're seeing that most of that, not most of it, the majority of it, I'll say, more than 50% is actually coming internationally. So we're still seeing really, really good strength there as far as what's that happening. And then I would say from the incremental guidance that we're seeing is we look at our pipeline, we have assumptions around attrition that may or may not happen. I will tell you what we're seeing is that the things that we've been doing, the continued enhancements that the team is making, we've seen a decline in the attrition rate. So we're actually seeing I'll say, better results than we actually originally forecasted. So the attrition rate is actually down from what we've experienced in the past. So we're seeing it be even stickier than it was in the past. So that's driving a lot of the, I'll call it, the incremental guide on the growth rate in the nontransaction revenue. 
On the tax, -- so yes, that is a bit of a kind of a little bit more uniqueness to the market structure, say, of Australia and Japan, particularly Australia. If you look at the overall mix, it's roughly a 50-50 between market data and access capacity fees, a little bit more leaning towards market data, and it's more weighted as a higher percentage of the overall mix within Australia."

So they're going to be pulling in, they want more access, they want more capacity. So you're definitely seeing some influence from macro, and we won't be able to say, hey, it's coming from x percent from macro and increased volumes versus as they continue to figure out with their incremental analytics and what they're doing internally and adding the incremental ports.

So starting with the 6 indices that we laid out over the last couple of quarters is how we're starting. And from there, we'll be looking to expand with more country-specific exposure. But I think the model is what I'd like to draw your attention to. If you remember, being able to express interest across Europe in 1 CCP, it's really the capital efficiencies that we've been chasing. It's the efficiency of a lit accessible market, a U.S. model, if you will, for posting liquidity, rewarding liquidity providers, who are posting that liquidity with the ability to trade, to be able to cross bid/ask. So it really is the benefit from customers looking at a screen and seeing an accessible market; market makers rewarded for the liquidity that they post from the open to the close; and then the efficiency of having 1 CCP where cross-European exposure can be most optimally cleared. So again, not a market share play. This is really expanding what we think is the opportunity for pure growth and being able to express an opinion in individual country and our pan-European risk.

But I would say the short answer is it primarily reflects what we see today, trying to factor in, as I mentioned earlier, to Rich's original question about kind of what are we seeing some of the growth and changing that is the lower attrition rates.

It's about -- two, it's about data distribution, and this opportunity really is a 2-way opportunity. So as Chris mentioned, and Brian touched on, being able to distribute our existing data properties into the Asia Pacific theater, where we really probably had single-digit representatives in the past, and now we've got all teams and platforms, that's a game changer. And going the other direction, being able to distribute data from those markets into our existing markets where we've got significant presence.

That's not something that we wake up and say we have to go do. But I think more importantly is the type of transaction that we would look at. And if you can put size to the side for a moment, is really in our core. We believe we've done a pretty good job in M&A with filling out the suite of products and services that help our customers pre, at and post trade. We like that, and we're in a full integration mode. But we look at the asset classes and geographies that we think we have an advantage to compete. If a country or region is open for competition, we want to look how to get in and compete in a way that we operate. So that our customers, when they see Cboe, they see an asset class that Cboe is involved in, that there is trust, there's knowledge, there's reliability, there's consistency. So we'll look across the globe. And if a region is competitive but open for competition, we want to take a good hard look. We're also interested in scale. So in the regions that we operate today, we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence. So I hope that gives you a sense of how we view M&A. And John, feel free to jump in."

And consider the just Chi-X alone relative to the scale of capital that had to be deployed to acquire that business, the returns that you will garner, on an aggregate basis, with these types of transactions are really, really meaningful. So again, it's not to say that we favor one versus the other, small versus scale. But small can have a really useful role to play in our organic growth plans."

And so that's really helping to accelerate that and enabling, I'll call it, the sales force. And I'll say that work very broadly to be able to package that offering in a more integrated way. Again, more work to be done there, but we're working towards that. 
I would say that more broadly though, what is missed and sometimes oversold, but we're not going to oversell it here is that there is a cross-sell effort across the asset classes that's really, really important. We're seeing -- continue to see incremental growth coming out of our equities business. And it's not just the market data sales team, it's the team that's actually focused on growing the transaction business is continuing to talk to the clients about the quality of the market data, the different offerings, the depth of book, top of book, whatever might meet those needs from a cost standpoint. So that cross-sell effort across all the asset classes. Europe, Asia, we look at again with respect to options. The team has been able to do that. So it's not just a market data sales team, it's actually the broader sales team across all the businesses, even like I said, those focused on the transaction business. So that rallying, we're seeing a lot more momentum really starting to take hold. And frankly, we want to incent that behavior and we do. So that, again, we all grow on a top line basis."

So it was in the equity side of the business and it was kind of a little bit of new pricing. So it wasn't any significant pushback. Honestly, it was pretty minor given the overall mix. It's just -- it showed up because so much had been -- there really hasn't been much pricing action that has been going on, which is why it's kind of had a little bit of that blip. So it really isn't a change in strategy as far as the what we expect to see in the near term. 
On the futures, thanks for highlighting that. I mean that's been a really strong growth story as we look at the actual overall units. We haven't made a large headline out of it yet, although we are incredibly proud of the success and where we are, though. As you look at the overall numbers relative to the rest of the scale of the business, it's not a huge revenue producer yet. But as we know, you have to start from somewhere. So we've seen a -- just if you look at the whole iBox complex, we've seen a 90% growth rate or more from where we were before. And we've seen growth not only from last year but also from the first quarter of, call it, 20% range across that complex.

I hope that you're doing well and remaining safe and healthy.  
Our purpose is to operate a trusted and inclusive global marketplace supported by our guiding principles, which include active transparency. It is in this spirit that we issued a press release this morning regarding spot volatility indices, and I want to comment on that before I dive into the results for the quarter.  
As outlined in the press release, we recently discovered instances where the spot VIX index calculation differs from the calculation described in VIX white paper, which details the formulas used for driving values related to VIX. Specifically, in certain instances, an index level was not produced at the applicable interval resulting in the dissemination of the prior index value. These instances relate only to the spot index, which is not a tradable product. We believe that VIX tradable futures and options as well as the NAV of products that track the daily closing prices, such as volatility, ETP products were not impacted. In addition, the calculation of the final settlement value for expiring VIX derivatives, which uses an independent process, was not impacted. 
We are investigating the degree of impact and the number of instances with respect to which the redissemination occurred. Based on our initial assessment, we believe that the vast majority of cases of the current VIX index calculation yielded the same result as provided in the VIX white paper.  
Now turning to Slide 5. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets. We continue to deliver on our strategic growth plan, expanding on the foundation we made over the last year as we build one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities trading networks. 
For the quarter, we reported year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring nontransaction revenues, with net revenue up 18% to over $350 million and adjusted EPS up 5%. Our solid results were driven by continued growth in recurring nontransaction revenues, increased trading volumes and engagement of institutional clients trading our index options and volatility products. We saw strong year-over-year growth in our proprietary products. ADV increased by 40% in VIX futures, 41% in VIX options and 8% in SPX options.  
During the second quarter, we made excellent progress executing on the 4 key incremental growth drivers I outlined at the beginning of this year. The opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue; the upcoming planned launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives; our expansion plans for BIDS trading; and extending access to our products and services across geographies and market participants. July 1, we also closed our acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific. We are very excited to further expand in this new region, and I'll share more about our plans later in the call.  
First, I'll touch on the solid rules of our recurring nontransaction revenue, powered by our Data and Access Solutions business. Similar to the first quarter, we exceeded our growth targets, achieving 21% growth during the second quarter. This increase included organic growth of 19% year-over-year, which was fueled by an equal contribution from both proprietary market data fees and access and capacity fees. 
As a result of this continued strong performance, we are increasing our 2021 organic growth target for recurring nontransaction revenue to a range of 12% to 13% from a range of 10% to 11%. The growth in nontransaction revenue was driven by new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms, such as Silexx, LiveVol Pro and Trade Alert as well as demand for logical ports and market data as customers look to gain global market access.  
Our Data and Access Solutions business provides a suite of data analytics, market intelligence and execution services, allowing us to interact with and add value for market participants at every step of the trade process. Later this year, we plan to launch Cboe Global Data Cloud, which will provide cloud distribution for certain data products, creating a simple, efficient way for customers to access our data. Our goal is to optimize the efficiency and delivery of our Data and Access Solutions to market participants across the globe. We believe the acquisition of Chi-X creates a tremendous opportunity for this business.  
Turning to Europe. I'm pleased to report that we received regulatory approvals this month to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, and we are on track to go live with this new market on September 6. We have key market participants ready to support the exchange from day 1, including banks, clearing firms, market makers and proprietary trading firms will help contribute to the provision of liquidity in client order flow.  
I'm incredibly proud of our team and their dedication over the last 18 months, working remotely from their homes to develop this new market designed to address the diverse needs of our customers. We believe that market participants will find tremendous benefit in being able to access a truly pan-European, transparent, efficient and lit derivatives market.  
Our overall business in Europe was exceptionally strong in the second quarter, and we expect the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives to build on this momentum. As we said before, we see a significant opportunity to grow the overall derivatives market in Europe. We are not aiming simply to take market share from incumbent exchanges. We intend to reshape and expand derivatives trading across Europe with a novel market structure designed to attract both new and existing participants. We're excited to get started doing just that in September.  
Moving to BIDS Trading. Last month, we announced plans to launch Cboe LIS, powered by BIDS in Canada in February 2022. Based on our highly successful offering in Europe, our Canadian LIS offering, which is subject to regulatory approval, we'll combine the industry-leading block trading capabilities from MATCHNow, the Canadian alternative trading system Cboe acquired last year and BIDS, to create an enhanced market center for block-sized liquidity. The launch of BIDS in Canada will be coupled with the planned migration of MATCHNow to Cboe technology, further extending our world-class trading platform. 
BIDS has established itself as the premier block trading destination in the U.S. and Europe, and we are excited about our plans to expand the BIDS network to Canada and Asia Pacific, first into Australia and then Japan, to serve even a broader base of customers.  
As we broaden our global footprint by entering new markets and launching new products and services, we further our goal of expanding access to a broader base of customers, both institutional and retail. Last month, we announced our November 21 launch for our extended global trading hours for VIX and SPX options as part of our 24/5 initiatives, subject to regulatory review. The length in global trading hours will complement our entry into Asia Pacific with the Chi-X acquisition and are designed to help meet growing investor demand with the ability to manage risk more efficiently, react to global macroenomic events as they happen and adjust SPX Index options positions around the clock.  
We've seen steady growth this year in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms as retail engagement across the market continues. Monthly ADV and SPX options on retail platforms has increased more than 50% since the start of the year. We've also continued to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV increasing 11% year-over-year in the second quarter.  
We see opportunity with the growing retail audience and remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. Product innovation remains a core focus of Cboe franchise, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our proprietary product offering with smaller contract sizes that appeal to both retail traders and institutional investors. 
Enhancing and expanding our educational offering from the Options Institute remains a top priority. Last quarter, the Options Institute hosted numerous webcasts and training sessions for market participants and also launched a new learning management system for retail and institutional investors looking to learn more about derivatives. We are currently demoing this system with clients and plan to make it available for on-demand online education later this year.  
Additionally, we've cultivated an expert team of derivative specialists to serve as agile faculty instructors for the Options Institute and look forward to hosting classes beginning this fall. These distinguished practitioners specialize in derivatives products, operations and risk management, decision theory and research, and we look forward to engaging with and educating investors on the benefits derivatives can provide to their investment portfolios.  
And last, we closed our acquisition of Chi-X at the beginning of July, enabling us to establish a significant presence in the Asia Pacific region. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment in our corporate evolution. We are now a truly global market infrastructure provider, operating markets and delivering products and services around the world every day of the week and around the clock. We plan to migrate Chi-X to Cboe technology over time, and the team is busy working through the integration plan and timeline. 
Offering one unified technology platform will help provide market participants with greater access to Cboe's diverse product set and more efficiency, resiliency and functionality when trading across Cboe's markets. As we move forward, we see a significant opportunity to expand our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products into one of the world's largest and most comprehensive global derivatives and securities networks. 
We have proven ourselves as a nimble and efficient operators of securities markets around the globe. But more importantly, we see securities markets as the foundational element in creating products and services that span the equities and derivatives landscape. Our transactional expertise allows us to create, package and distribute a host of market data, analytics and index products.  
Having recognized benchmark indices allows us in turn to develop additional tradable products and new markets for these products to trade, creating a virtuous cycle of transaction and nontransaction product growth at Cboe. You only have to look at the success of Cboe Europe, which started out as a small equity market and is now on the cusp of launching a pan-European derivatives market to realize the power and potential of these relationships.  
I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter, and I want to thank all Cboe employees for their hard work and also welcome Chi-X to Cboe's family. We look forward to delivering enhanced value to our customers and our shareholders as we broaden our global network and access to Cboe's unique products and services.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.  As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial resul",1381,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.  
As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results for the quarter, seeing solid contributions from our proprietary trading products as well as our Data and Access Solutions. Earnings in the second quarter increased on a year-over-year basis as we build a more balanced and diversified company. We remain steadfast in our efforts to become one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks, enhancing value to our customers as well as our shareholders.  
Now a quick review of the quarter. Our net revenue increased 18%, net transaction fees were up 19% and recurring nontransaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 34%. Adjusted EBITDA of $234 million was up 11%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.38, up 5% compared to last year's quarterly results.  
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide some re-thoughts. The revenue increase in our Options segment, which accounted for a majority of our total net revenue growth, was driven by higher trading volumes in both our proprietary and multi-listed options. Total Options ADV was up 12%, as we saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. Revenue per contract also moved higher by 5%, given positive mix shift to index products and a strong increase in our multi-listed options, RPC, up 31%. And we continue to benefit from solid growth in recurring nontransaction revenue, particularly access and capacity fees in the segment.  
North American equities revenue decreased 2% year-over-year as industry equity volumes in the U.S. declined by 15%, and Cboe's market share trended lower, primarily reflecting incremental share going off exchange. While our overall market share has trended lower, our continuous trading market share has held up relatively well, and we are optimistic about the many innovations we have introduced and plan to introduce to the market, including retail priority, quote depletion protection, earlier trading hours and periodic auctions. The volume declines in 2Q were partially offset by a $10 million contribution from BIDS and MATCHNow for the quarter. Lastly, recurring nontransaction revenue increased by more than $4 million or 15% with organic growth of 14%.  
Second quarter revenue increased in futures by 31% on the back of a 49% increase in ADV. The revenue increase in Europe primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP, which contributed $11.7 million during the quarter and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation. Underlying trends are strong in the business' average daily notional value traded on Cboe European equities was up 16%, outpacing the broader market's 5% increase. Net capture also rose 7% during the quarter. And finally, the 1% net revenue growth in FX was a result of slightly higher trading activity. 
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $128 million for the quarter, up 34% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, over less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 16% or $16 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits.  
Cboe's recurring nontransaction revenue momentum accelerated in the second quarter with year-over-year organic growth reaching 19%. Again, the strong growth was largely a product of additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we are seeing both physical and logical port usage has accelerated in our equities and options businesses, driven by increased demand for trading capacity.  
On the market data side, we have seen equities also performing well as the strength of Cboe One and top of book products have driven market data growth, both domestically and internationally. We are excited to build on our strong organic growth trends with the addition of Chi-X and its revenue basis is approximately 2/3 recurring in nature.  
We are increasing our organic growth outlook by 2 percentage points to 12% to 13% as we factor in the Chi-X contribution. Our total nontransaction revenue growth is now expected to reach 15% to 16% for 2021, up 4 percentage points versus our prior expectation. Overall, our recurring nontransaction revenue businesses remain a critical component of the Cboe growth story and one that we expect to continue to accelerate and diversify our revenue stream over time.  
Moving to our expense guidance. We are reaffirming our full year range of $531 million to $539 million. Importantly, our unchanged guidance range now includes the full impact of Chi-X, an incremental $13 million, which is expected to be completely offset by expense reductions related to COVID-19 in 2020 and have continued into 2021 longer than we initially expected; a reduction in facilities overlap given our ability to expand space in one of our existing locations; and lower compensation expenses due to hiring at a slower pace than we initially expected within both our core operating expenses as well as some of our strategic growth initiatives.  
Note that we expect the incremental Chi-X expenses to be more than offset by incremental revenues. We expect our expense spend to increase sequentially in 3Q and 4Q, and we expect to see positive returns for the investments we're making. Specifically, our investments reflect our plan to increase access to our existing products and services, especially growth in our index options and futures by developing listing and distributing unique products; enhancing our marketing, education and content; and increasing our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors.  
Turning now to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are lowering our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $34 million to $38 million from $38 million to $42 million. Our CapEx guidance range moves $5 million lower to $55 million to $60 million. And while our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.1%, above last year's rate of 26.7% and above our guided range of 27.5% to 29.5%. We are reaffirming the guidance for the full year under the current tax laws. However, we now expect the adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be at the higher end of the guidance range given where we are in 2021 2Q.  
While we are not providing full year guidance on interest expense, we note that we drew an additional $110 million on our term loan credit agreement at the end of the second quarter to fund a portion of the Chi-X deal. Going forward, absent any additional borrowing and significant changes to LIBOR, our interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 is expected to be $11.5 million to $12 million, slightly below our second quarter expense of $12.3 million, reflecting more favorable rates associated with amendments to our term loan facility and EuroCCP credit facility that were effective late June and early July, respectively.  
In addition to the investment priorities we outlined earlier in the call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $79 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. We plan to continue to use our share repurchase capacity opportunistically.  
Our leverage ratio increased slightly versus the quarter to 1.5x at June 30 as a result of the additional term loan financing used to partially fund the Chi-X acquisition.  
Overall, our balance sheet remains unencumbered as we look at the incremental capital use in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders.  
In summary, we are pleased to report solid 2Q results. We are even more excited about the momentum we carry into the remainder of this year with an increase in guidance for our nontransaction revenue growth rate overall and importantly, organic, and our unchanged expense guidance range despite the addition of Chi-X expenses. We believe we have made and expect to continue to make investments that are set to deliver and increase value to our shareholders.  
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

Before we turn to Q&A, I wanted to quickly highlight a couple of important corporate developments.  
As we accelerate our growth and operations on a global scale, we remain focused on our environmental footprint, social responsibilities and opportunities to make a difference in the communities in which we live and work. To that end, last month, we announced a new community engagement program, Cboe Empowers. This program provides mentorship, scholarships and guidance to under-resourced students through their educational journey from elementary school to career. Cboe Empowers is our most ambitious philanthropic endeavor to date. We couldn't be more excited to help equip the next generation with opportunity to realize the career choices available to them as they embark on building their future. Additional information about this exciting program as well as some of the other important initiatives we are focused on regarding environmental, social and corporate governance is included in our recently published ESG report. We are committed to doing our part to help ensure we are tackling the important challenges of our global community is facing today and in the future.  
I'd also like to take a minute to express my immense gratitude to Debbie Koopman for her service to Cboe as she will be retiring in November. During her 13 years with us, she has built Cboe's Investor Relations program from the ground up, played a major role in our transition to a public company through our successful IPO in 2010 and has been pivotal in the execution of our acquisition strategy. She has helped shape and communicate Cboe's vision and mission to the investment community, developing strong relationships with our shareholders, potential investors and research analysts. I have always appreciated her sharp wit, tough questions, friendship, and indelible laugh, and we'll miss working with her. 
We are thrilled to have Ken Hill succeeding Debbie as Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken joined us last month and is working closely with Debbie to ensure a smooth transition. His experience and expertise in capital markets makes him a perfect fit for this role. We wish Debbie all the best in her retirement. 
I'll now pass it back to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

And so I'll just kind of reiterate a couple of things. One, on the access capacity. We've kind of seen that strength all year long, again, reflecting, like I said, accelerated demand for basically overall capacity to access our markets, again, showing the quality and depth and what we're doing there. And again, that is across the board. That is options, equities. Europe, actually the strongest. On a pure growth rate is European equities. From an overall contribution, it's still coming from the options business as well as North American equities.  
On the market data side, the -- I would say a couple of things I want to hit there as well is that I hinted that, that growth is actually coming also internationally and domestically. If we look at just the market data growth, we're seeing that most of that, not most of it, the majority of it, I'll say, more than 50% is actually coming internationally. So we're still seeing really, really good strength there as far as what's that happening. And then I would say from the incremental guidance that we're seeing is we look at our pipeline, we have assumptions around attrition that may or may not happen. I will tell you what we're seeing is that the things that we've been doing, the continued enhancements that the team is making, we've seen a decline in the attrition rate. 
So we're actually seeing, I'll say, better results than we actually originally forecasted. So the attrition rate is actually down from what we've experienced in the past. So we're seeing it to be even stickier than it was in the past. So that's driving a lot of the, I'll call it, incremental guide on the growth rate in the nontransaction revenue.  
On the tax, -- so yes, that is a bit of a kind of a little bit more uniqueness to the market structure, say, of Australia and Japan, particularly Australia. If you look at the overall mix, it's roughly a 50-50 between market data and access capacity fees, a little bit more leaning towards market data, and it's more weighted as a higher percentage of the overall mix within Australia."

So to go back to that then is that, I would say, the primary growth driver is the existing. We're still seeing some new. But again, so it's -- I would say it's all of the 3. I wish I had one particular thing I could point out that certainly would make it easier. But I think it makes a really nice mix of diversity as we roll forward as we try and touch several levers to keep it moving forward in the momentum."

As I've stated in the prepared remarks, regulatory review and approvals are coming along nicely. We're operational ready. So starting with the 6 indices that we laid out over the last couple of quarters is how we're starting. And from there, we'll be looking to expand with more country-specific exposure. But I think the model is what I'd like to draw your attention to. If you remember, being able to express interest across Europe in 1 CCP, it's really the capital efficiencies that we've been chasing. It's the efficiency of a lit accessible market, a U.S. model, if you will, for posting liquidity, rewarding liquidity providers who are posting that liquidity with the ability to trade to be able to cross bid/ask. 
So it really is the benefit from customers looking at a screen and seeing an accessible market, market makers rewarded for the liquidity that they post from the open to the close, and then the efficiency of having 1 CCP where cross-European exposure can be most optimally cleared. So again, not a market share play. This is really expanding what we think is the opportunity for pure growth and being able to express an opinion in individual country and our pan-European risk. Chris, anything to add?"

So you've seen consecutive quarters of this category continue to grow. So we're continuously running against higher and higher comps prior year. 
But I would say the short answer is it primarily reflects what we see today, trying to factor in, as I mentioned earlier, to Rich's original question about kind of what are we seeing some of the growth and changing that is the lower attrition rates. And like I said, some slightly stronger pipeline with some percentage of success rates over time. And again, sometimes it's hard to predict when those sign, but that's somewhat factored in.

There's a transaction growth opportunity, and that's about market share, we've done that before in other markets. We look to do that in these 2. 
It's about -- two, it's about data distribution, and this opportunity really is a 2-way opportunity. So as Chris mentioned, and Brian touched on, being able to distribute our existing data properties into the Asia Pacific theater, where we really probably had single-digit representatives in the past, and now we've got all teams and platforms, that's a game changer. And going the other direction, being able to distribute data from those markets into our existing markets where we've got significant presence. 
And finally, the third level is on BIDS and connectivity with BIDS. And that BIDS will drive both of those. It will drive transaction volume, and it will drive the data opportunity in Australia and Japan."

And so that's really helping to accelerate that and enabling, I'll call it, the sales force. And I'll say that work very broadly to be able to package that offering in a more integrated way. Again, more work to be done there, but we're working towards that. 
I would say that more broadly though, what is missed and sometimes oversold, but we're not going to oversell it here is that there is a cross-sell effort across the asset classes that's really, really important. We're seeing -- continue to see incremental growth coming out of our equities business. And it's not just the market data sales team, it's the team that's actually focused on growing the transaction business is continuing to talk to the clients about the quality of the market data, the different offerings, the depth of book, top of book, whatever might meet those needs from a cost standpoint. 
So that cross-sell effort across all the asset classes. Europe, Asia, we look at it with respect to options. The team has been able to do that. So it's not just a market data sales team, it's actually the broader sales team across all the businesses, even like I said, those focused on the transaction business.

It's just -- it showed up because so much had been -- there really hasn't been much pricing action that has been going on, which is why it's kind of had a little bit of that blip. So it really isn't a change in strategy as far as the what we expect to see in the near term. 
On the futures, thanks for highlighting that. I mean that's been a really strong growth story as we look at the actual overall units. We haven't made a large headline out of it yet, although we are incredibly proud of the success and where we are, though. As you look at the overall numbers relative to the rest of the scale of the business, it's not a huge revenue producer yet. But as we know, you have to start from somewhere. So we've seen a -- just if you look at the whole iBoxx complex, we've seen a 90% growth rate or more from where we were before. And we've seen growth not only from last year but also from the first quarter of, call it, 20% range across that complex.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that you're doing well and remaining safe and healthy.
Our purpose is to operate a trusted and inclusive global marketplace supported by our guiding principles, which include active transparency. It is in this spirit that we issued a press release this morning regarding spot volatility indices, and I want to comment on that before I dive into the results for the quarter.
As outlined in the press release, we recently discovered instances where the spot VIX index calculation differs from the calculation described in VIX white paper, which details the formulas used for driving values related to VIX. Specifically, in certain instances, an index level was not produced at the applicable interval resulting in the dissemination of the prior index value. These instances relate only to the spot index, which is not a tradable product. We believe that VIX tradable futures and options as well as the NAV of products that track the daily closing prices, such as volatility, ETP products were not impacted. In addition, the calculation of the final settlement value for expiring VIX derivatives, which uses an independent process, was not impacted. 
We are investigating the degree of impact and the number of instances with respect to which the redissemination occurred. Based on our initial assessment, we believe that the vast majority of cases of the current VIX index calculation yielded the same result as provided in the VIX white paper.  
Now turning to Slide 5. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets. We continue to deliver on our strategic growth plan, expanding on the foundation we laid over the last year as we build one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities trading networks. 
For the quarter, we reported year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring nontransaction revenues, with net revenue up 18% to over $350 million and adjusted EPS up 5%. Our solid results were driven by continued growth in recurring nontransaction revenues, increased trading volumes and engagement of institutional clients trading our index options and volatility products. We saw strong year-over-year growth in our proprietary products. ADV increased by 40% in VIX futures, 41% in VIX options and 8% in SPX options.
During the second quarter, we made excellent progress executing on the 4 key incremental growth drivers I outlined at the beginning of this year. The opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue; the upcoming planned launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives; our expansion plans for BIDS trading; and extending access to our products and services across geographies and market participants. July 1, we also closed our acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific. We are very excited to further expand in this new region, and I'll share more about our plans later in the call.
First, I'll touch on the solid rules of our recurring nontransaction revenue, powered by our Data and Access Solutions business. Similar to the first quarter, we exceeded our growth targets, achieving 21% growth during the second quarter. This increase included organic growth of 19% year-over-year, which was fueled by an equal contribution from both proprietary market data fees and access and capacity fees.
As a result of this continued strong performance, we are increasing our 2021 organic growth target for recurring nontransaction revenue to a range of 12% to 13% from a range of 10% to 11%. The growth in nontransaction revenue was driven by new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms, such as Silexx, LiveVol Pro and Trade Alert as well as demand for logical ports and market data as customers look to gain global market access. 
Our Data and Access Solutions business provides a suite of data analytics, market intelligence and execution services, allowing us to interact with and add value for market participants at every step of the trade process. Later this year, we plan to launch Cboe Global Data Cloud, which will provide cloud distribution for certain data products, creating a simple, efficient way for customers to access our data. Our goal is to optimize the efficiency and delivery of our Data and Access Solutions to market participants across the globe. We believe the acquisition of Chi-X creates a tremendous opportunity for this business.
Turning to Europe. I'm pleased to report that we received regulatory approvals this month to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, and we are on track to go live with this new market on September 6. We have key market participants ready to support the exchange from day 1, including banks, clearing firms, market makers and proprietary trading firms will help contribute to the provision of liquidity and client order flow.
I'm incredibly proud of our team and their dedication over the last 18 months, working remotely from their homes to develop this new market designed to address the diverse needs of our customers. We believe that market participants will find tremendous benefit in being able to access a truly pan-European, transparent, efficient and lit derivatives market.
Our overall business in Europe was exceptionally strong in the second quarter, and we expect the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives to build on this momentum. As we said before, we see a significant opportunity to grow the overall derivatives market in Europe. We are not aiming simply to take market share from incumbent exchanges. We intend to reshape and expand derivatives trading across Europe with a novel market structure designed to attract both new and existing participants. We're excited to get started doing just that in September.  
Moving to BIDS Trading. Last month, we announced plans to launch Cboe LIS, powered by BIDS in Canada in February 2022. Based on our highly successful offering in Europe, our Canadian LIS offering, which is subject to regulatory approval, will combine the industry-leading block trading capabilities from MATCHNow, the Canadian alternative trading system Cboe acquired last year and BIDS to create an enhanced market center for block-sized liquidity. The launch of BIDS in Canada will be coupled with the planned migration of MATCHNow to Cboe technology, further extending our world-class trading platform.
BIDS has established itself as the premier block trading destination in the U.S. and Europe, and we are excited about our plans to expand the BIDS network to Canada and Asia Pacific, first into Australia and then Japan, to serve even a broader base of customers.  
As we broaden our global footprint by entering new markets and launching new products and services, we further our goal of expanding access to a broader base of customers, both institutional and retail. Last month, we announced a November 21 launch for our extended global trading hours for VIX and SPX options as part of our 24/5 initiatives, subject to regulatory review. The length in global trading hours will complement our entry into Asia Pacific with the Chi-X acquisition and are designed to help meet growing investor demand with the ability to manage risk more efficiently, react to global macroeconomic events as they happen and adjust SPX Index options positions around the clock.
We've seen steady growth this year in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms as retail engagement across the market continues. Monthly ADV and SPX options on retail platforms has increased more than 50% since the start of the year. We've also continued to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV increasing 11% year-over-year in the second quarter.
We see opportunity with the growing retail audience and remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. Product innovation remains a core focus of Cboe franchise, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our proprietary product offering with smaller contract sizes that appeal to both retail traders and institutional investors.
Enhancing and expanding our educational offering from the Options Institute remains a top priority. Last quarter, the Options Institute hosted numerous webcasts and training sessions for market participants and also launched a new learning management system for retail and institutional investors looking to learn more about derivatives. We are currently demoing this system with clients and plan to make it available for on-demand online education later this year.  
Additionally, we've cultivated an expert team of derivative specialists to serve as agile faculty instructors for the Options Institute and look forward to hosting classes beginning this fall. These distinguished practitioners specialize in derivatives products, operations and risk management, decision theory and research, and we look forward to engaging with and educating investors on the benefits derivatives can provide to their investment portfolios.
And last, we closed our acquisition of Chi-X at the beginning of July, enabling us to establish a significant presence in the Asia Pacific region. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment in our corporate evolution. We are now a truly global market infrastructure provider, operating markets and delivering products and services around the world every day of the week and around the clock. We plan to migrate Chi-X to Cboe technology over time, and the team is busy working through the integration plan and time line. 
Offering one unified technology platform will help provide market participants with greater access to Cboe's diverse product set and more efficiency, resiliency and functionality when trading across Cboe's markets. As we move forward, we see a significant opportunity to expand our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products into one of the world's largest and most comprehensive global derivatives and securities networks.
We have proven ourselves as a nimble and efficient operators of securities markets around the globe. But more importantly, we see securities markets as the foundational element in creating products and services that span the equities and derivatives landscape. Our transactional expertise allows us to create, package and distribute a host of market data, analytics and index products.  
Having recognized benchmark indices allows us in turn to develop additional tradable products and new markets for these products to trade, creating a virtuous cycle of transaction and nontransaction product growth at Cboe. You only have to look at the success of Cboe Europe, which started out as a small equity market and is now on the cusp of launching a pan-European derivatives market to realize the power and potential of these relationships.  
I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter, and I want to thank all Cboe employees for their hard work and also welcome Chi-X to Cboe's family. We look forward to delivering enhanced value to our customers and our shareholders as we broaden our global network and access to Cboe's unique products and services.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results",1382,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.
As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results for the quarter, seeing solid contributions from our proprietary trading products as well as our Data and Access Solutions. Earnings in the second quarter increased on a year-over-year basis as we build a more balanced and diversified company. We remain steadfast in our efforts to become one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks, enhancing value to our customers as well as our shareholders.
Now a quick review of the quarter. Our net revenue increased 18%, net transaction fees were up 19% and recurring nontransaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 34%. Adjusted EBITDA of $234 million was up 11%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.38, up 5% compared to last year's quarterly results.
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide summary thoughts. The revenue increase in our Options segment, which accounted for a majority of our total net revenue growth, was driven by higher trading volumes in both our proprietary and multi-listed options. Total Options ADV was up 12% as we saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. Revenue per contract also moved higher by 5%, given positive mix shift to index products and a strong increase in our multi-listed options, RPC, up 31%. And we continue to benefit from solid growth in recurring nontransaction revenue, particularly access and capacity fees in the segment.  
North American equities revenue decreased 2% year-over-year as industry equity volumes in the U.S. declined by 15%, and Cboe's market share trended lower, primarily reflecting incremental share going off exchange. While our overall market share has trended lower, our continuous trading market share has held up relatively well, and we are optimistic about the many innovations we have introduced and plan to introduce to the market, including retail priority, quote depletion protection, earlier trading hours and periodic auctions. The volume declines in 2Q were partially offset by a $10 million contribution from BIDS and MATCHNow for the quarter. Lastly, recurring nontransaction revenue increased by more than $4 million or 15% with organic growth of 14%.  
Second quarter revenue increased in futures by 31% on the back of a 49% increase in ADV. The revenue increase in Europe primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP, which contributed $11.7 million during the quarter and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation. Underlying the trends are strong in the business as average daily notional value traded on Cboe European equities was up 16%, outpacing the broader market's 5% increase. Net capture also rose 7% during the quarter. And finally, the 1% net revenue growth in FX was a result of slightly higher trading activity.
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $128 million for the quarter, up 34% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions over less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 16% or $16 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits.
Cboe's recurring nontransaction revenue momentum accelerated in the second quarter with year-over-year organic growth reaching 19%. Again, the strong growth was largely a product of additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we are seeing both physical and logical port usage has accelerated in our equities and options businesses, driven by increased demand for trading capacity.  
On the market data side, we have seen equities also performing well as the strength of Cboe One and top-of-book products have driven market data growth, both domestically and internationally. We are excited to build on our strong organic growth trends with the addition of Chi-X and its revenue base that is approximately 2/3 recurring in nature.
We are increasing our organic growth outlook by 2 percentage points to 12% to 13% as we factor in the Chi-X contribution. Our total nontransaction revenue growth is now expected to reach 15% to 16% for 2021, up 4 percentage points versus our prior expectation. Overall, our recurring nontransaction revenue businesses remain a critical component of the Cboe growth story and one that we expect to continue to accelerate and diversify our revenue stream over time.  
Moving to our expense guidance. We are reaffirming our full year range of $531 million to $539 million. Importantly, our unchanged guidance range now includes the full impact of Chi-X, an incremental $13 million, which is expected to be completely offset by expense reductions related to COVID-19 in 2020 and have continued into 2021 longer than we initially expected; a reduction in facilities overlap given our ability to expand space in one of our existing locations; and lower compensation expenses due to hiring at a slower pace than we initially expected within both our core operating expenses as well as some of our strategic growth initiatives.
Note that we expect the incremental Chi-X expenses to be more than offset by incremental revenues. We expect our expense spend to increase sequentially in 3Q and 4Q, and we expect to see positive returns for the investments we're making. Specifically, our investments reflect our plan to increase access to our existing products and services, especially growth in our index options and futures by developing, listing and distributing unique products; enhancing our marketing, education and content; and increasing our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors.
Turning now to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are lowering our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $34 million to $38 million from $38 million to $42 million. Our CapEx guidance range moves $5 million lower to $55 million to $60 million. And while our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.1%, above last year's rate of 26.7% and above our guided range of 27.5% to 29.5%. We are reaffirming the guidance for the full year under the current tax laws. However, we now expect the adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be at the higher end of the guidance range given where we are in 2021 2Q.  
While we are not providing full year guidance on interest expense, we note that we drew an additional $110 million on our term loan credit agreement at the end of the second quarter to fund a portion of the Chi-X deal. Going forward, absent any additional borrowing and significant changes to LIBOR, our interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 is expected to be $11.5 million to $12 million, slightly below our second quarter expense of $12.3 million, reflecting more favorable rates associated with amendments to our term loan facility and EuroCCP credit facility that were effective late June and early July, respectively.
In addition to the investment priorities we outlined earlier in the call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $79 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. We plan to continue to use our share repurchase capacity opportunistically.
Our leverage ratio increased slightly versus the quarter to 1.5x at June 30 as a result of the additional term loan financing used to partially fund the Chi-X acquisition.
Overall, our balance sheet remains unencumbered as we look at the incremental capital use in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders.
In summary, we are pleased to report solid 2Q results. We are even more excited about the momentum we carry into the remainder of this year with an increase in guidance for our nontransaction revenue growth rate overall and importantly, organic, and our unchanged expense guidance range despite the addition of Chi-X expenses. We believe we have made and expect to continue to make investments that are set to deliver an increased value to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

Before we turn to Q&A, I wanted to quickly highlight a couple of important corporate developments.  
As we accelerate our growth and operations on a global scale, we remain focused on our environmental footprint, social responsibilities and opportunities to make a difference in the communities in which we live and work. To that end, last month, we announced a new community engagement program, Cboe Empowers. This program provides mentorship, scholarships and guidance to under-resourced students through their educational journey from elementary school to career. Cboe Empowers is our most ambitious philanthropic endeavor to date. We couldn't be more excited to help equip the next generation with opportunity to realize the career choices available to them as they embark on building their future.
Additional information about this exciting program as well as some of the other important initiatives we are focused on regarding environmental, social and corporate governance is included in our recently published ESG report. We are committed to doing our part to help ensure we are tackling the important challenges our global community is facing today and in the future.
I'd also like to take a minute to express my immense gratitude to Debbie Koopman for her service to Cboe as she will be retiring in November. During her 13 years with us, she has built Cboe's Investor Relations program from the ground up, played a major role in our transition to a public company through our successful IPO in 2010 and has been pivotal in the execution of our acquisition strategy. She has helped shape and communicate Cboe's vision and mission to the investment community, developing strong relationships with our shareholders, potential investors and research analysts. I have always appreciated her sharp wit, tough questions, friendship and indelible laugh, and we'll miss working with her. 
We are thrilled to have Ken Hill succeeding Debbie as Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken joined us last month and is working closely with Debbie to ensure a smooth transition. His experience and expertise in capital markets makes him a perfect fit for this role. We wish Debbie all the best in her retirement.
I'll now pass it back to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

So we're still seeing really, really good strength there as far as what's that happening. And then I would say from the incremental guidance that we're seeing is we look at our pipeline, we have assumptions around attrition that may or may not happen. I will tell you what we're seeing is that the things that we've been doing, the continued enhancements that the team is making, we've seen a decline in the attrition rate. 
So we're actually seeing, I'll say, better results than we actually originally forecasted. So the attrition rate is actually down from what we've experienced in the past. So we're seeing it to be even stickier than it was in the past. So that's driving a lot of the, I'll call it, incremental guide on the growth rate in the nontransaction revenue.
On the tax -- so yes, that is a bit of a kind of a little bit more uniqueness to the market structure, say, of Australia and Japan, particularly Australia. If you look at the overall mix, it's roughly a 50-50 between market data and access capacity fees, a little bit more leaning towards market data, and it's more weighted as a higher percentage of the overall mix within Australia."

One is -- and some of this has to do with some of the offerings we're also providing, but you're going to see -- I think it's a little bit of macro. And obviously, we're seeing higher volumes. So they're going to be pulling in, they want more access, they want more capacity.
So you're definitely seeing some influence from macro, and we won't be able to say, hey, it's coming from X percent from macro and increased volumes versus as they continue to figure out with their incremental analytics and what they're doing internally and adding the incremental ports. So we're seeing both. And I think we're helping facilitate that with some of our -- in the pre-trade, at trade, post-trade analytics and services and what we're doing with them. So we're seeing a combination of both.
So to go back to that then is that, I would say, the primary growth driver is the existing. We're still seeing some new. But again, so it's -- I would say it's all of the 3.

As I've stated in the prepared remarks, regulatory review and approvals are coming along nicely. We're operational ready. So starting with the 6 indices that we laid out over the last couple of quarters is how we're starting. And from there, we'll be looking to expand with more country-specific exposure. But I think the model is what I'd like to draw your attention to. If you remember, being able to express interest across Europe in 1 CCP, it's really the capital efficiencies that we've been chasing. It's the efficiency of a lit accessible market, a U.S. model, if you will, for posting liquidity, rewarding liquidity providers who are posting that liquidity with the ability to trade to be able to cross bid/ask.
So it really is the benefit from customers looking at a screen and seeing an accessible market, market makers rewarded for the liquidity that they post from the open to the close, and then the efficiency of having 1 CCP where cross-European exposure can be most optimally cleared. So again, not a market share play. This is really expanding what we think is the opportunity for pure growth and being able to express an opinion in individual country and pan-European risk.

So you've seen consecutive quarters of this category continue to grow. So we're continuously running against higher and higher comps prior year.
But I would say the short answer is it primarily reflects what we see today, trying to factor in, as I mentioned earlier, to Rich's original question about kind of what are we seeing some of the growth and changing that is the lower attrition rates. And like I said, some slightly stronger pipeline with some percentage of success rates over time. And again, sometimes it's hard to predict when those sign, but that's somewhat factored in.

It's about -- two, it's about data distribution, and this opportunity really is a 2-way opportunity. So as Chris mentioned, and Brian touched on, being able to distribute our existing data properties into the Asia Pacific theater, where we really probably had single-digit representatives in the past, and now we've got all teams and platforms, that's a game changer. And going the other direction, being able to distribute data from those markets into our existing markets where we've got significant presence.

I think there's 2 things that I would say -- that I think we'd say incremental momentum here with what Ed mentioned as far as with Cathy and pulling this together is, one is what we're doing, I'll call it, on the more analytics side and the computational versus the real time, and that's bringing a renewed focus of bringing it all together and making it more digestible and easier and meeting outside customer demand for that. And so that's really helping to accelerate that and enabling, I'll call it, the sales force. And I'll say that work very broadly to be able to package that offering in a more integrated way. Again, more work to be done there, but we're working towards that. 
I would say that more broadly though, what is missed and sometimes oversold, but we're not going to oversell it here is that there is a cross-sell effort across the asset classes that's really, really important. We're seeing -- continue to see incremental growth coming out of our equities business. And it's not just the market data sales team, it's the team that's actually focused on growing the transaction business is continuing to talk to the clients about the quality of the market data, the different offerings, the depth of book, top of book, whatever might meet those needs from a cost standpoint. 
So that cross-sell effort across all the asset classes. Europe, Asia, we look at it with respect to options. The team has been able to do that. So it's not just a market data sales team, it's actually the broader sales team across all the businesses, even like I said, those focused on the transaction business. So that rallying, we're seeing a lot more momentum really starting to take hold. And frankly, we want to incent that behavior and we do so that, again, we all grow on a top line basis."

Or if there's still a lot of upside from pricing if the environment and pushback has changed? So just an update on pricing. Sorry if I missed it earlier.

So it was in the equity side of the business and it was kind of a little bit of new pricing. So it wasn't any significant pushback. Honestly, it was pretty minor given the overall mix. It's just -- it showed up because so much had been -- there really hasn't been much pricing action that has been going on, which is why it's kind of had a little bit of that blip. So it really isn't a change in strategy as far as the -- what we expect to see in the near term. 
On the futures, thanks for highlighting that. I mean that's been a really strong growth story as we look at the actual overall units. We haven't made a large headline out of it yet, although we are incredibly proud of the success and where we are, though. As you look at the overall numbers relative to the rest of the scale of the business, it's not a huge revenue producer yet. But as we know, you have to start from somewhere. So we've seen a -- just if you look at the whole iBoxx complex, we've seen a 90% growth rate or more from where we were before. And we've seen growth not only from last year but also from the first quarter of, call it, 20% range across that complex.

So no dramatic reforms we're pushing for, but we think it's time to review tick sizes, for sure."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that you're doing well and remaining safe and healthy.
Our purpose is to operate a trusted and inclusive global marketplace supported by our guiding principles, which include active transparency. It is in this spirit that we issued a press release this morning regarding spot volatility indices, and I want to comment on that before I dive into the results for the quarter.
As outlined in the press release, we recently discovered instances where the spot VIX index calculation differs from the calculation described in VIX white paper, which details the formulas used for driving values related to VIX. Specifically, in certain instances, an index level was not produced at the applicable interval resulting in the dissemination of the prior index value. These instances relate only to the spot index, which is not a tradable product. We believe that VIX tradable futures and options as well as the NAV of products that track the daily closing prices, such as volatility, ETP products were not impacted. In addition, the calculation of the final settlement value for expiring VIX derivatives, which uses an independent process, was not impacted. 
We are investigating the degree of impact and the number of instances with respect to which the redissemination occurred. Based on our initial assessment, we believe that the vast majority of cases of the current VIX index calculation yielded the same result as provided in the VIX white paper.  
Now turning to Slide 5. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021 at Cboe Global Markets. We continue to deliver on our strategic growth plan, expanding on the foundation we laid over the last year as we build one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities trading networks. 
For the quarter, we reported year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring nontransaction revenues, with net revenue up 18% to over $350 million and adjusted EPS up 5%. Our solid results were driven by continued growth in recurring nontransaction revenues, increased trading volumes and engagement of institutional clients trading our index options and volatility products. We saw strong year-over-year growth in our proprietary products. ADV increased by 40% in VIX futures, 41% in VIX options and 8% in SPX options.
During the second quarter, we made excellent progress executing on the 4 key incremental growth drivers I outlined at the beginning of this year. The opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue; the upcoming planned launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives; our expansion plans for BIDS trading; and extending access to our products and services across geographies and market participants. July 1, we also closed our acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific. We are very excited to further expand in this new region, and I'll share more about our plans later in the call.
First, I'll touch on the solid rules of our recurring nontransaction revenue, powered by our Data and Access Solutions business. Similar to the first quarter, we exceeded our growth targets, achieving 21% growth during the second quarter. This increase included organic growth of 19% year-over-year, which was fueled by an equal contribution from both proprietary market data fees and access and capacity fees.
As a result of this continued strong performance, we are increasing our 2021 organic growth target for recurring nontransaction revenue to a range of 12% to 13% from a range of 10% to 11%. The growth in nontransaction revenue was driven by new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms, such as Silexx, LiveVol Pro and Trade Alert as well as demand for logical ports and market data as customers look to gain global market access. 
Our Data and Access Solutions business provides a suite of data analytics, market intelligence and execution services, allowing us to interact with and add value for market participants at every step of the trade process. Later this year, we plan to launch Cboe Global Data Cloud, which will provide cloud distribution for certain data products, creating a simple, efficient way for customers to access our data. Our goal is to optimize the efficiency and delivery of our Data and Access Solutions to market participants across the globe. We believe the acquisition of Chi-X creates a tremendous opportunity for this business.
Turning to Europe. I'm pleased to report that we received regulatory approvals this month to launch Cboe Europe derivatives, and we are on track to go live with this new market on September 6. We have key market participants ready to support the exchange from day 1, including banks, clearing firms, market makers and proprietary trading firms will help contribute to the provision of liquidity and client order flow.
I'm incredibly proud of our team and their dedication over the last 18 months, working remotely from their homes to develop this new market designed to address the diverse needs of our customers. We believe that market participants will find tremendous benefit in being able to access a truly pan-European, transparent, efficient and lit derivatives market.
Our overall business in Europe was exceptionally strong in the second quarter, and we expect the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives to build on this momentum. As we said before, we see a significant opportunity to grow the overall derivatives market in Europe. We are not aiming simply to take market share from incumbent exchanges. We intend to reshape and expand derivatives trading across Europe with a novel market structure designed to attract both new and existing participants. We're excited to get started doing just that in September.  
Moving to BIDS Trading. Last month, we announced plans to launch Cboe LIS, powered by BIDS in Canada in February 2022. Based on our highly successful offering in Europe, our Canadian LIS offering, which is subject to regulatory approval, will combine the industry-leading block trading capabilities from MATCHNow, the Canadian alternative trading system Cboe acquired last year and BIDS to create an enhanced market center for block-sized liquidity. The launch of BIDS in Canada will be coupled with the planned migration of MATCHNow to Cboe technology, further extending our world-class trading platform.
BIDS has established itself as the premier block trading destination in the U.S. and Europe, and we are excited about our plans to expand the BIDS network to Canada and Asia Pacific, first into Australia and then Japan, to serve even a broader base of customers.  
As we broaden our global footprint by entering new markets and launching new products and services, we further our goal of expanding access to a broader base of customers, both institutional and retail. Last month, we announced a November 21 launch for our extended global trading hours for VIX and SPX options as part of our 24/5 initiatives, subject to regulatory review. The length in global trading hours will complement our entry into Asia Pacific with the Chi-X acquisition and are designed to help meet growing investor demand with the ability to manage risk more efficiently, react to global macroeconomic events as they happen and adjust SPX Index options positions around the clock.
We've seen steady growth this year in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms as retail engagement across the market continues. Monthly ADV and SPX options on retail platforms has increased more than 50% since the start of the year. We've also continued to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV increasing 11% year-over-year in the second quarter.
We see opportunity with the growing retail audience and remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. Product innovation remains a core focus of Cboe franchise, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our proprietary product offering with smaller contract sizes that appeal to both retail traders and institutional investors.
Enhancing and expanding our educational offering from the Options Institute remains a top priority. Last quarter, the Options Institute hosted numerous webcasts and training sessions for market participants and also launched a new learning management system for retail and institutional investors looking to learn more about derivatives. We are currently demoing this system with clients and plan to make it available for on-demand online education later this year.  
Additionally, we've cultivated an expert team of derivative specialists to serve as agile faculty instructors for the Options Institute and look forward to hosting classes beginning this fall. These distinguished practitioners specialize in derivatives products, operations and risk management, decision theory and research, and we look forward to engaging with and educating investors on the benefits derivatives can provide to their investment portfolios.
And last, we closed our acquisition of Chi-X at the beginning of July, enabling us to establish a significant presence in the Asia Pacific region. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment in our corporate evolution. We are now a truly global market infrastructure provider, operating markets and delivering products and services around the world every day of the week and around the clock. We plan to migrate Chi-X to Cboe technology over time, and the team is busy working through the integration plan and time line. 
Offering one unified technology platform will help provide market participants with greater access to Cboe's diverse product set and more efficiency, resiliency and functionality when trading across Cboe's markets. As we move forward, we see a significant opportunity to expand our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products into one of the world's largest and most comprehensive global derivatives and securities networks.
We have proven ourselves as a nimble and efficient operators of securities markets around the globe. But more importantly, we see securities markets as the foundational element in creating products and services that span the equities and derivatives landscape. Our transactional expertise allows us to create, package and distribute a host of market data, analytics and index products.  
Having recognized benchmark indices allows us in turn to develop additional tradable products and new markets for these products to trade, creating a virtuous cycle of transaction and nontransaction product growth at Cboe. You only have to look at the success of Cboe Europe, which started out as a small equity market and is now on the cusp of launching a pan-European derivatives market to realize the power and potential of these relationships.  
I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter, and I want to thank all Cboe employees for their hard work and also welcome Chi-X to Cboe's family. We look forward to delivering enhanced value to our customers and our shareholders as we broaden our global network and access to Cboe's unique products and services.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results",1382,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. 
Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '21 as compared to 2Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.
As Ed just indicated, we reported strong financial results for the quarter, seeing solid contributions from our proprietary trading products as well as our Data and Access Solutions. Earnings in the second quarter increased on a year-over-year basis as we build a more balanced and diversified company. We remain steadfast in our efforts to become one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks, enhancing value to our customers as well as our shareholders.
Now a quick review of the quarter. Our net revenue increased 18%, net transaction fees were up 19% and recurring nontransaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 34%. Adjusted EBITDA of $234 million was up 11%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.38, up 5% compared to last year's quarterly results.
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide summary thoughts. The revenue increase in our Options segment, which accounted for a majority of our total net revenue growth, was driven by higher trading volumes in both our proprietary and multi-listed options. Total Options ADV was up 12% as we saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. Revenue per contract also moved higher by 5%, given positive mix shift to index products and a strong increase in our multi-listed options, RPC, up 31%. And we continue to benefit from solid growth in recurring nontransaction revenue, particularly access and capacity fees in the segment.  
North American equities revenue decreased 2% year-over-year as industry equity volumes in the U.S. declined by 15%, and Cboe's market share trended lower, primarily reflecting incremental share going off exchange. While our overall market share has trended lower, our continuous trading market share has held up relatively well, and we are optimistic about the many innovations we have introduced and plan to introduce to the market, including retail priority, quote depletion protection, earlier trading hours and periodic auctions. The volume declines in 2Q were partially offset by a $10 million contribution from BIDS and MATCHNow for the quarter. Lastly, recurring nontransaction revenue increased by more than $4 million or 15% with organic growth of 14%.  
Second quarter revenue increased in futures by 31% on the back of a 49% increase in ADV. The revenue increase in Europe primarily reflects the addition of EuroCCP, which contributed $11.7 million during the quarter and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation. Underlying the trends are strong in the business as average daily notional value traded on Cboe European equities was up 16%, outpacing the broader market's 5% increase. Net capture also rose 7% during the quarter. And finally, the 1% net revenue growth in FX was a result of slightly higher trading activity.
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $128 million for the quarter, up 34% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions over less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 16% or $16 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits.
Cboe's recurring nontransaction revenue momentum accelerated in the second quarter with year-over-year organic growth reaching 19%. Again, the strong growth was largely a product of additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we are seeing both physical and logical port usage has accelerated in our equities and options businesses, driven by increased demand for trading capacity.  
On the market data side, we have seen equities also performing well as the strength of Cboe One and top-of-book products have driven market data growth, both domestically and internationally. We are excited to build on our strong organic growth trends with the addition of Chi-X and its revenue base that is approximately 2/3 recurring in nature.
We are increasing our organic growth outlook by 2 percentage points to 12% to 13% as we factor in the Chi-X contribution. Our total nontransaction revenue growth is now expected to reach 15% to 16% for 2021, up 4 percentage points versus our prior expectation. Overall, our recurring nontransaction revenue businesses remain a critical component of the Cboe growth story and one that we expect to continue to accelerate and diversify our revenue stream over time.  
Moving to our expense guidance. We are reaffirming our full year range of $531 million to $539 million. Importantly, our unchanged guidance range now includes the full impact of Chi-X, an incremental $13 million, which is expected to be completely offset by expense reductions related to COVID-19 in 2020 and have continued into 2021 longer than we initially expected; a reduction in facilities overlap given our ability to expand space in one of our existing locations; and lower compensation expenses due to hiring at a slower pace than we initially expected within both our core operating expenses as well as some of our strategic growth initiatives.
Note that we expect the incremental Chi-X expenses to be more than offset by incremental revenues. We expect our expense spend to increase sequentially in 3Q and 4Q, and we expect to see positive returns for the investments we're making. Specifically, our investments reflect our plan to increase access to our existing products and services, especially growth in our index options and futures by developing, listing and distributing unique products; enhancing our marketing, education and content; and increasing our efforts to tap into the growing base of retail investors.
Turning now to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are lowering our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $34 million to $38 million from $38 million to $42 million. Our CapEx guidance range moves $5 million lower to $55 million to $60 million. And while our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.1%, above last year's rate of 26.7% and above our guided range of 27.5% to 29.5%. We are reaffirming the guidance for the full year under the current tax laws. However, we now expect the adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be at the higher end of the guidance range given where we are in 2021 2Q.  
While we are not providing full year guidance on interest expense, we note that we drew an additional $110 million on our term loan credit agreement at the end of the second quarter to fund a portion of the Chi-X deal. Going forward, absent any additional borrowing and significant changes to LIBOR, our interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 is expected to be $11.5 million to $12 million, slightly below our second quarter expense of $12.3 million, reflecting more favorable rates associated with amendments to our term loan facility and EuroCCP credit facility that were effective late June and early July, respectively.
In addition to the investment priorities we outlined earlier in the call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to return $79 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. We plan to continue to use our share repurchase capacity opportunistically.
Our leverage ratio increased slightly versus the quarter to 1.5x at June 30 as a result of the additional term loan financing used to partially fund the Chi-X acquisition.
Overall, our balance sheet remains unencumbered as we look at the incremental capital use in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders.
In summary, we are pleased to report solid 2Q results. We are even more excited about the momentum we carry into the remainder of this year with an increase in guidance for our nontransaction revenue growth rate overall and importantly, organic, and our unchanged expense guidance range despite the addition of Chi-X expenses. We believe we have made and expect to continue to make investments that are set to deliver an increased value to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

Before we turn to Q&A, I wanted to quickly highlight a couple of important corporate developments.  
As we accelerate our growth and operations on a global scale, we remain focused on our environmental footprint, social responsibilities and opportunities to make a difference in the communities in which we live and work. To that end, last month, we announced a new community engagement program, Cboe Empowers. This program provides mentorship, scholarships and guidance to under-resourced students through their educational journey from elementary school to career. Cboe Empowers is our most ambitious philanthropic endeavor to date. We couldn't be more excited to help equip the next generation with opportunity to realize the career choices available to them as they embark on building their future.
Additional information about this exciting program as well as some of the other important initiatives we are focused on regarding environmental, social and corporate governance is included in our recently published ESG report. We are committed to doing our part to help ensure we are tackling the important challenges our global community is facing today and in the future.
I'd also like to take a minute to express my immense gratitude to Debbie Koopman for her service to Cboe as she will be retiring in November. During her 13 years with us, she has built Cboe's Investor Relations program from the ground up, played a major role in our transition to a public company through our successful IPO in 2010 and has been pivotal in the execution of our acquisition strategy. She has helped shape and communicate Cboe's vision and mission to the investment community, developing strong relationships with our shareholders, potential investors and research analysts. I have always appreciated her sharp wit, tough questions, friendship and indelible laugh, and we'll miss working with her. 
We are thrilled to have Ken Hill succeeding Debbie as Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken joined us last month and is working closely with Debbie to ensure a smooth transition. His experience and expertise in capital markets makes him a perfect fit for this role. We wish Debbie all the best in her retirement.
I'll now pass it back to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call."

And so I'll just kind of reiterate a couple of things. One, on the access capacity. We've kind of seen that strength all year long, again, reflecting, like I said, accelerated demand for basically overall capacity to access our markets, again, showing the quality and depth and what we're doing there. And again, that is across the board. That is options, equities. Europe actually the strongest. On a pure growth rate is European equities. From an overall contribution, it's still coming from the options business as well as North American equities.  
On the market data side, the -- I would say a couple of things I want to hit there as well is that I hinted that, that growth is actually coming also internationally and domestically. If we look at just the market data growth, we're seeing that most of that -- not most of it, the majority of it, I'll say, more than 50% is actually coming internationally. So we're still seeing really, really good strength there as far as what's that happening. And then I would say from the incremental guidance that we're seeing is we look at our pipeline, we have assumptions around attrition that may or may not happen. I will tell you what we're seeing is that the things that we've been doing, the continued enhancements that the team is making, we've seen a decline in the attrition rate. 
So we're actually seeing, I'll say, better results than we actually originally forecasted. So the attrition rate is actually down from what we've experienced in the past. So we're seeing it to be even stickier than it was in the past. So that's driving a lot of the, I'll call it, incremental guide on the growth rate in the nontransaction revenue.
On the tax -- so yes, that is a bit of a kind of a little bit more uniqueness to the market structure, say, of Australia and Japan, particularly Australia. If you look at the overall mix, it's roughly a 50-50 between market data and access capacity fees, a little bit more leaning towards market data, and it's more weighted as a higher percentage of the overall mix within Australia."

One is -- and some of this has to do with some of the offerings we're also providing, but you're going to see -- I think it's a little bit of macro. And obviously, we're seeing higher volumes. So they're going to be pulling in, they want more access, they want more capacity.
So you're definitely seeing some influence from macro, and we won't be able to say, hey, it's coming from X percent from macro and increased volumes versus as they continue to figure out with their incremental analytics and what they're doing internally and adding the incremental ports.

So starting with the 6 indices that we laid out over the last couple of quarters is how we're starting. And from there, we'll be looking to expand with more country-specific exposure. But I think the model is what I'd like to draw your attention to. If you remember, being able to express interest across Europe in 1 CCP, it's really the capital efficiencies that we've been chasing. It's the efficiency of a lit accessible market, a U.S. model, if you will, for posting liquidity, rewarding liquidity providers who are posting that liquidity with the ability to trade to be able to cross bid/ask.
So it really is the benefit from customers looking at a screen and seeing an accessible market, market makers rewarded for the liquidity that they post from the open to the close, and then the efficiency of having 1 CCP where cross-European exposure can be most optimally cleared. So again, not a market share play. This is really expanding what we think is the opportunity for pure growth and being able to express an opinion in individual country and pan-European risk.

And then as we look into 2022, it's probably early, but given that opportunity, you mentioned the incumbents are 20x the size of Chi-X Japan and Australia and other opportunities, can you just talk about maybe the confidence of potentially also being able to generate double-digit recurring revenue growth on an organic basis, not including acquisitions in 2022?"

Hopefully, I'll get them all, Brian, so please remind me or let us know if we can get them all. So as far as the nontransaction revenue growth, we will -- in that growth expectation is we tend to be conservative as you know. And while there is a pipeline, we have some visibility. We do have some assumptions around it. It's primarily going to reflect, I'll call it, a growth rate of kind of where we are today and what we see and relative to our growth last year as well, right? So you've seen consecutive quarters of this category continue to grow. So we're continuously running against higher and higher comps prior year.
But I would say the short answer is it primarily reflects what we see today, trying to factor in, as I mentioned earlier, to Rich's original question about kind of what are we seeing some of the growth and changing that is the lower attrition rates. And like I said, some slightly stronger pipeline with some percentage of success rates over time. And again, sometimes it's hard to predict when those sign, but that's somewhat factored in.
I think on the Chi-X side, I'm going to let John talk a little bit about that as far as the growth and how we're seeing that relative to the incumbents and again, a little bit more of that to make a little bit more color."

Brian, the growth rate in historically for Chi-X has been double digit, both on the transaction side and the data and access side. But you'll recall when we framed the strategic benefits of the deal on announcement, we talked about really 3 levels intrinsic to the opportunity. There's a transaction growth opportunity, and that's about market share, we've done that before in other markets. We look to do that in these 2.
It's about -- two, it's about data distribution, and this opportunity really is a 2-way opportunity. So as Chris mentioned, and Brian touched on, being able to distribute our existing data properties into the Asia Pacific theater, where we really probably had single-digit representatives in the past, and now we've got all teams and platforms, that's a game changer. And going the other direction, being able to distribute data from those markets into our existing markets where we've got significant presence.
And then finally, the third level is on BIDS and connectivity with BIDS. And that BIDS will drive both of those. It will drive transaction volume, and it will drive the data opportunity in Australia and Japan."

We believe we've done a pretty good job in M&A with filling out the suite of products and services that help our customers pre, at and post trade. We like that, and we're in a full integration mode. But we look at the asset classes and geographies that we think we have an advantage to compete. If a country or region is open for competition, we want to look how to get in and compete in a way that we operate so that our customers, when they see Cboe, they see an asset class that Cboe is involved in, that there is trust, there's knowledge, there's reliability, there's consistency.
So we'll look across the globe. And if a region is competitive but open for competition, we want to take a good hard look. We're also interested in scale.

And so that's really helping to accelerate that and enabling, I'll call it, the sales force. And I'll say that work very broadly to be able to package that offering in a more integrated way. Again, more work to be done there, but we're working towards that. 
I would say that more broadly though, what is missed and sometimes oversold, but we're not going to oversell it here is that there is a cross-sell effort across the asset classes that's really, really important. We're seeing -- continue to see incremental growth coming out of our equities business. And it's not just the market data sales team, it's the team that's actually focused on growing the transaction business is continuing to talk to the clients about the quality of the market data, the different offerings, the depth of book, top of book, whatever might meet those needs from a cost standpoint. 
So that cross-sell effort across all the asset classes. Europe, Asia, we look at it with respect to options. The team has been able to do that. So it's not just a market data sales team, it's actually the broader sales team across all the businesses, even like I said, those focused on the transaction business. So that rallying, we're seeing a lot more momentum really starting to take hold. And frankly, we want to incent that behavior and we do so that, again, we all grow on a top line basis."

It's just -- it showed up because so much had been -- there really hasn't been much pricing action that has been going on, which is why it's kind of had a little bit of that blip. So it really isn't a change in strategy as far as the -- what we expect to see in the near term. 
On the futures, thanks for highlighting that. I mean that's been a really strong growth story as we look at the actual overall units. We haven't made a large headline out of it yet, although we are incredibly proud of the success and where we are, though. As you look at the overall numbers relative to the rest of the scale of the business, it's not a huge revenue producer yet. But as we know, you have to start from somewhere. So we've seen a -- just if you look at the whole iBoxx complex, we've seen a 90% growth rate or more from where we were before. And we've seen growth not only from last year but also from the first quarter of, call it, 20% range across that complex.

We're happy to have you on board as Debbie Koopman prepares for retirement next month. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As we head into year-end, I hope that you're doing well and remaining safe and healthy. 
I'm pleased to report on solid financial results for the third quarter 2021 at Cboe Global Markets. For the quarter, we reported revenue growth across each of our business segments, reflecting strong year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring nontransaction revenues, with net revenue up 27% and adjusted EPS up 31%. 
Our solid third quarter results were driven by higher volumes in our index options and volatility products, increased demand for our suite of data and access solutions and growth in trading volumes across nearly all our segments. In our proprietary products, ADV increased 29% in VIX futures, 32% in VIX options and 39% in SPX options. We also continue to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV up 20% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
During the quarter, we also delivered on several strategic milestones to expand our global network, including the successful launch of our European derivatives platform as well as the closing of our acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific. I'll touch on both in a moment. 
But first, I want to discuss our plans to enter the digital asset market through the planned acquisition of ErisX, which we announced last week. ErisX will provide Cboe with spot trading data, derivatives and clearing capabilities for digital assets through its regulated futures exchange and clearinghouse. 
The past 2 weeks have been a watershed moment for the digital asset industry with the launch of trading in the first Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. equities market. As the appetite for ownership and digital assets continues to grow, we believe Cboe can play a guiding role in shaping the trajectory of this revolutionary market. 
Today, we are at a critical inflection point. We're seeing strong retail demand, institutional interest, market growth streaming of digital assets even with traditional financial firms. As a leading provider of global market infrastructure and tradable products, we can bring the knowledge, structure and transparency of our trusted markets to the digital asset space. 
The demand and excitement for digital assets is driven by the unique market structure and freedom it affords, and we want to maintain that innovative spirit while providing the regulatory framework and structure that many market participants desire. We have secured support from a tremendous group of industry leaders who are aligned with our vision and want to shape and define this asset class now and for the future. These industry leaders bring different perspectives and expertise from retail brokers, crypto leading firms, global liquidity providers and sell-side banks. They are expected to form a digital advisory committee tasked with advising us on the ongoing development of our digital asset business, CBOE Digital. These industry leaders include DRW, Fidelity Digital Assets, Galaxy Digital, Interactive Brokers -- Hexos, Robin, Virtu Financial and. Additionally, certain members of the digital advisory committee intend to acquire minority ownership interest in CBOE Digital. I'm confident that together with ErisX CEO, Tom Chippas, and his team and our incredible partner group, we can not only meet the growing demand for institutional and retail trading solutions but also push the boundaries of digital asset innovation and unlock its next phase of growth. 
I'm extremely pleased with the progress we made during the third quarter, executing on the 4 key incremental growth drivers I outlined at the beginning of this year: the opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue; the launch of Cboe Europe derivatives; our expansion plans for BIDS Trading and extending access to our products and services across geographies and market participants. 
We saw positive momentum in our data and access solutions again this quarter, fueling a 21% increase in our recurring nontransaction revenue. This growth was driven by continued demand for access to our exchanges, proprietary market data and new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms, including Silexx and Trader Alert. We continue to optimize the efficiency and delivery of our data and access solutions to market participants and are excited to launch CBOE Global Cloud, a new real-time cloud-based market data streaming service in collaboration with Amazon Web Services, November 1. CBOE Global Cloud is expected to help further extend Cboe's data to new users and geographies an important step towards broadening investor access to our proprietary content and market data globally. 
Turning now to Europe, where we successfully launched European derivatives market on September 6. We are very pleased with the initial progress with trading and clearing running smoothly as we slowly build volume. Over the coming months, we plan to introduce additional products and onboard new participants. Bringing the first truly pan-European transparent and lit derivatives market to Europe is a remarkable achievement, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. 
Additionally, our European Equities business delivered strong results in the third quarter with average daily notional value traded up 29%. Cboe LIS, powered by BIDS, continue to see positive momentum and, for the first time in its history, became the largest block trading platform in Europe for the month of August. BIDS has established itself as the premier block training destination in the U.S. and Europe. We are excited about our plans to expand the bids network to Canada early next year and then to Asia Pacific region to serve an even broader base of customers. 
Turning to Asia Pacific. We made good progress integrating the Chi-X team since we closed the acquisition at the beginning of July. We plan to migrate Chi-X to Cboe technology and are busy working through the integration plan and time line. 
With our expanded footprint in the Asia Pacific region, we see significant opportunity to further develop our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products into one of the world's largest derivatives and securities networks. Beginning November 21, we plan to take an important step towards broadening our network and access to our proprietary products through the launch of extended global trading hours for VIX and SPX options as part of our 24x5 initiative. The length in global trading hours complement our entry into Asia Pacific and are designed to help meet growing investor demand for the ability to manage risk more efficiently and adjust SPX and VIX options and positions around the clock. 
We are also pleased to announce that Webull, a leading retail broker platform with a growing global presence, began offering our proprietary products, fixed and SPX options, on their platform this month. We've continued to see strong demand for SPX options for both institutional and retail broker platforms and are eager to expand access to this product suite. Similar to last quarter, we saw solid growth in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms with ADV on those platforms up 24% from the second quarter, hitting a new all-time high. 
Key to our global network expansion are strong partnerships. And to that end, we were thrilled to expand our relationship with MSCI and extend the licensing agreement that allows Cboe to offer options trading on MSCI global indices through 2031. We have valued our strong relationship with MSCI for many years and look forward to further collaboration in the years ahead, particularly in the important area of ESG investing. 
As the retail market continues to grow, we remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. To that end, earlier this week, we announced plans to launch Nanos, a first-of-its-kind options contract designed to make trading more accessible for the retail trader. Increased retail participation has fueled record trading across the industry. Between the top 4 retail broker platforms, there are now more than 150 million retail brokerage accounts, and many of these accounts are too small to take advantage of the potential benefits, certain options contracts can offer. We plan to launch our first Nanos product on the S&P 500 Index first quarter 2022. At a fraction of the size of the standard options contract, the 1 multiplier cash-settled Nanos S&P 500 answers the growing demand for a simpler, more cost-effective way to gain broad exposure to the U.S. equity market. The S&P 500 option market is one of the most highly traded and liquid option markets across the globe. Through our Nanos S&P 500 product, we are broadening access to a greater universe of traders who can enjoy the potential benefits options provide, including hedging, asset allocation and income generation strategies. 
To complement the launch of Nanos, the CBOE Options Institute plans to offer a new options introductory curriculum tailored to retail traders through our long-standing commitment to education, we are continuously evolving our programs to offer more retail-centric content through the Options Institute, and we look forward to welcoming a new generation of traders to options trading with the launch of Nanos. 
As we broaden our global footprint by entering new markets and launching new products and services, we further our goal of expanding access to a broader base of customers, both institutional and retail. By leveraging our technological expertise, customer relationships and capital markets capabilities, we plan to continue to unlock additional revenue opportunities across our businesses. 
We head into the final months of the year on a stronger footing than ever, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our growth opportunities ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Let me remind everyone that, unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 3Q '21 as compared to 3Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. 
As Ed just indicated, the third quarter was incredibly strong for Cboe with robust results from both a transaction and nontransaction basis. Overall, adjusted earnings increased 31% versus the third quarter of 2020 and improved off solid second quarter 2021 metrics. As we move forward, we look for the cash, derivatives and data portions of our business to work in unison to enhance revenue opportunities and shareholder value. 
Now a quick look at the third quarter. Our net revenue increased 27%, setting a new quarterly record. Net transaction fees were up 39% and recurring nontransaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 29%. Adjusted EBITDA of $240 million was up 25%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.45, up 31% compared to last year's quarterly results. 
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll just provide summary thoughts. While we saw year-over-year growth in all of our segments, our Options segment produced above average growth for the quarter of 30% driven by higher trading volumes and revenue per contract in both our proprietary and multi-listed options. Total options ADV was up 23% as we saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. Revenue per contract also moved higher by 16% and given positive mix shift to index products and a strong increase in our multi-listed options RPC, up 23%. And we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in recurring nontransaction revenue. particularly access and capacity fees. 
North American equities revenue increased 13% year-over-year as acquisition-related net transaction and clearing fees were further helped by strong proprietary market data fees and access capacity fees. This was offset somewhat by a 1% year-over-year decline in U.S. equity ADV and a 1% year-over-year decline in market share for the quarter. While market share trends have been impacted by aggressive pricing trends from some competitors, we remain focused on optimizing long-term profit in the business through the many initiatives we have introduced or plan to introduce to the market. 
For the quarter, MATCHNow and BIDS contributed $8.5 million in net revenue. Lastly, recurring nontransaction revenue increased by more than $5 million or 17%, with organic growth of 14%. Third quarter revenue increased in futures by 24% on the back of a 30% increase in ADV and a 6% increase in capture. Looking forward, we were pleased to see the SEC recently approved filings to list and trade shares of 2 new volatility shares products in inverse and long VIX futures ETF. These new listings are likely to increase the VIX trading ecosystem as the AUM builds on those products. The revenue increase in Europe and APAC primarily reflects the addition of Chi-X Asia Pacific in July 2021, an $8.2 million contribution as well as growth in European equities and clearing. Underlying trends remained strong in the third quarter as industry average daily notional value traded, market share on Cboe European Equities and net capture all moved higher on a year-over-year basis. And finally, revenues in the FX segment increased 8% as compared to the third quarter of 2020 as trading volumes and net capture moved higher. During the quarter, global FX market share hadan  all-time high of 17%. 
Cboe's recurring nontransaction revenue growth remained elevated in the third quarter with year-over-year organic growth reaching 14%. Again, this strong growth was largely a product of additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we saw both physical and logical port usage remain robust in our equities and options businesses driven by increased demand for training capacity and, on the market data side, the equities top of book and depth of both products continue to perform well. We are increasing our organic outlook by 1 to 2 percentage points to approximately 14%. Our total recurring nontransaction revenue growth is now expected to reach approximately 18% for 2021, up 2 to 3 percentage points versus our prior expectation. Overall, we are very pleased with the continued traction in this business as it's an important element of Cboe's ecosystem of products and services. 
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $140 million for the quarter, up 29% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 17% or $19 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits. 
Moving to our expense guidance. We are tightening and raising our expense guidance range for the full year to $536 million to $541 million from $531 million to $539 million. The $4 million increase in the midpoint reflects higher incentive compensation costs, reflecting the strong year-to-date operating results we have posted as well as our plans for increased hiring during the fourth quarter and a slight uptick in our depreciation and amortization forecast. As a firm, we believe in a pay-for-performance culture and not only has our year-to-date financial performance has been strong, we have made significant progress against our longer-term growth priorities, especially towards increasing access to Cboe products and services, as Ed noted previously. 
As you recall from our February earnings meeting, we laid out a path for revenue growth that would be preceded by higher-than-normal expense growth that would slightly compress margins in the short term to enable longer-term growth. We remain focused on investing in key initiatives with attractive returns, and we look forward to meeting the current and future market demand by prudently investing organically and inorganically to meet those needs, even if it requires upfront spend. 
Now turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are raising our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $38 million to $42 million from $34 million to $38 million due to the earlier timing of various products. Our CapEx guidance range moves $8 million lower to $47 million to $52 million, and we are reaffirming the higher end of our guided tax range of 27.5% to 29.5% for the full year under the current tax laws. Our interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $11.7 million. We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to hold steady in the $11.5 million to $12 million range. 
In addition to the investment priorities we outlined earlier in the call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend for the 11th straight year, growing 14% on a year-over-year basis. In total, we returned $52 million to shareholders through dividends in the third quarter. Our leverage ratio decreased slightly versus the prior quarter to 1.4x at September 30, as our debt levels remained steady on a sequential basis. 
Overall, our balance sheet remains unencumbered as we look to put incremental capital to use in value-enhancing ways for shareholders. Our adjusted cash and financial investments balance is elevated, reflecting the planned use of cash to fund a portion of the planned transactions we recently announced as well as a slightly higher requirement for regulatory capital purposes. 
In summary, Cboe delivered a very strong third quarter, and we're even more enthusiastic about the number of high-quality growth initiatives we are bringing into our ecosystem, solutions that expand access to global markets for our customers, grow our geographic footprint and breadth of asset classes and diversify our revenue base. We look for these planned additions to fuel continued growth across the Cboe ecosystem. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

We look forward to sharing ideas and engaging this network on an important dialogue on how derivative exchanges can support greater sustainability in addition to advancing partnerships with index leaders in this important space. 
As you can see, we have been extremely busy, and I thank the entire Cboe team for their hard work delivering outstanding results. We look forward to hosting our Investor Day on November 16, where we will dive further into our business, providing more color on these initiatives and how they are helping drive our strategy. We hope you can join us. Details for accessing the event or on our IR website. 
Finally, I'd once again like to thank Debbie Koopman for her service and wish her all the best as she heads into retirement next month. She'd be with us through Investor Day, so it's not quite farewell yet. But this is her finale for quarterly earnings. She will be dearly missed by me and the entire Cboe team.

So let me -- Rich, let me take a half a step back on ErisX because I think it's important to recognize that we didn't just wake up a couple of months ago and think, ""Gosh, crypto, look what's happening, it might we need to get into this space."" When we launched, if you recall, the first futures contract in 2017 and even before that, we had applications at the SEC for ETNs  and ETPs. So at this space, we've had our eye on. We thought the ecosystem in this space would have evolved a bit quicker. So we've always had an eye on getting back into the space the last couple of calls, I've been mentioning that. 
Importantly, also, we were early investors in ErisX in 2018 when Don Wilson and Tom Chippas saw the opportunity to build out a regulated fair market in spot, derivatives clearing and margining. So long answer to your question, framed that way, we've constantly, and since the launch of those future, consciously been looking for an opportunity that gets us back into the market.

It's a little confusing. It's also called Eris but that business offers swap futures. They're traded on a competing exchange. We're talking about here, ErisX, which is purely a crypto platform. The businesses are completely separate. And what ErisX offers, as Ed mentioned, is a -- really a start-to-finish integrated form for crypto trading, spot clearing and derivatives. And the platform is live today. So there are significant users on the platform depending on the day. Some days, it can be really 1 of the top 3, 4 in the market. 
The partners that we're bringing to the table here, and you see us mentioned in the press release, these partners is forming our digital advisory committee, many of those partners are live today on the platform. So we believe, as we kind of look at the evolution of the space, the partners we're bringing to the table and the readiness of the platform, that our timing really is pretty much spot on here because the technology platform is built. The regulatory approvals are in place. 
One thing that we're really looking forward to, as we move towards close and towards evolving the business is the expansion of the derivatives franchise. So again, the regulatory approvals for that platform were all in place. The technology is in place. But what we intend to do is work with the CFTC in gaining approval for margin futures and then other derivatives products, which we think are -- can be game-changing for the industry. There really is nothing like it's settling into the physical coin in an integrated spot clearing and futures and derivatives platform. So we look forward to that build. But really, that's the only piece that is yet to come. The rest is live and poised for growth today."

But if you think about the clearing members, the market makers, the customers that are going to be trading and putting the right incentives in place, so what we've done is we've obviously tried to remove those frictional elements to facilitate liquidity and facilitate volume. So there are stipends in place. There are -- there is tiering in place with respect to those elements, to -- again, to incent those participants. And we'll see that continue to build as we add more and more clearing members, as we add more market makers to both the futures and the options side. 
So stay tuned for that progress. We'll put out some targets at our Investor Day as far as where we think this business can go, call it, in a more of a 3- to 5-year time frame. But I would say right now, as the team has already mentioned, the key success here was the operational element of getting people on the platform, getting it traded. The products are successful from that standpoint. We're achieving the on-screen transparency and liquidity of what we set out to do and then with the expectation of growing that over time."

So give us a little context of what happened there. And then maybe lastly, CBOE launched Bitcoin futures at a peak price and then seem to change its mind 15 months later at sort of a Bitcoin price trough.

We do appreciate incenting market makers to post quotes and to trade. But with no end in sight to the regulatory uncertainty, we decided to step back. So I wish we were smart enough to know that the price of Bitcoin was at its top. I probably would have made a trade there instead of pivoting in a way and waiting for regulation and design to be more obvious for us with the ecosystem as we find it today, primed and ready for an exchange like ErisX. 
And significantly, you didn't mention the partners that we're entering this with super important. They do see the opportunity to offer their customers access and an experience that they're used to in other asset classes. This is very important. This is not a disintermediated market where we think we should be offering direct to customer customers are used to the platform that they trade on. Those partners that we list, we are not getting in between them and their experience. So if they like to pivot from their exposure in options Cboe's proprietary products and on the same platform, be able to trade crypto in a safe, regulated fairway, that's the experience we're looking for.

So there are 5 coins in the platform today and the platform is highly extensible. So currently under review additional coins and altcoins. And it's worth noting that in terms of today's bond platform is one of the newest out there, given the time frame since launch is relatively short. And we believe that it has all the underpinnings to recognize pretty substantial growth. It's important to recognize that -- this -- our involvement in the space is -- and the entire space itself is an evolution. And so Ed really kind of described nicely our initial foray into it. We call that product version 1.0, cash settled pretty simple kind of construct. We quickly learned and evolved from those learnings that the industry was demanding something different. They were demanding physical settlement. They were demanding a robust clearing platform that dealt with the underlying spot in conjunction with the derivatives product. 
And so when we decided to take our original B 1.0 product down, it was really with a mind towards doing something much more comprehensive to meet the demands of the digital asset space as market participants were telling us they wanted. So that process of kind of getting back into it with the right platform, it took some time. We were waiting for the perfect opportunity. I would  say that we were attracted to ErisX really because of the comprehensive sort of from spot through clearing and data to derivatives. It conforms very nicely with our strategy across asset classes and geographies. 
But as we -- kind of to the evolution theme, as we started down the path of evaluating a deal with Eris and we sampled the market to ensure that we were thinking about things in a way that really resonate with market participants, this is where another step the evolution came into play, where there was really this obvious demand for participation from market participants to be part of this initiative to be on the cap table to be aligned with value creation. And so we met that demand with the structure that you saw us announce last week. So really evolution, and it's a rapid evolution because the market -- the digital asset space is evolving so rapidly. I don't think we could have really nearly come close to meeting the demand that the market is telling us to have for a particular type of products and services with our prior product in any sense, and this platform does it for us."

And that's a little bit clear what that means when you talk about derivatives, the CFTC-regulated platform, both clearinghouse and futures market. 
On the spot side of things, the industry is really hungering for this part of the demand. We're talking about, hungering for a framework. And so with these partners that we have on board with us, as part of our digital asset advisory committee, we are -- we intend to go to the regulators, work together collaboratively with the regulators in an industry to help define what that means product by product, token by token, coin by coin. And we think that initiative and the clarity that, that will potentially bring can unleash the next wave of growth in this space. So that's the opportunity. It's very much regulated together with our market participants. 
And then the liquidity out in the market today is really -- it's -- despite the some of the regulatory overhang here, the liquidity is impressive but the growth in the space is so rapid that, soon enough, the platforms and the OTC trading that's occurring out there is going to potentially exceed its capacity.

I'd also say, as we looked at this asset, we see that there's a lot been a ton of innovation in the digital asset space but there still remains a trust, transparency and data gap. And we think with ErisX, we can  fill that gap with Tom Chippas and team and the platform they've built and expand on the vision that ErisX started with because of the partners we're bringing to the table. 
And regarding competition, we won't just have a spot market. We're having a derivatives market that will allow for physically settled futures, margin futures, as John talked about. There's a  big and broad vision here that we think we can fulfill with these partners, not disintermediating but embracing them so they can access all the customers, both traditional and nontraditional customers, that want to trade digital assets. We'll be able to get to them through these intermediaries and this platform that's going to embrace transparency and regulation as it gets formed and clarified. And I think that Tom and team have built this right. They've got the regulatory approvals that are needed. They've got the money transfer licenses in 50-plus states, CFTC approval for a futures exchange and a designated clearing organization.

As far as the growth rate, we continue to see growth. What you're seeing is you're still going to see growth over -- that's projecting growth into the fourth quarter. But the third quarter, the rate itself may not be as great. And what we saw also -- this is a little bit just kind of more of a math issue is that the fourth quarter in last year started to pick up where we started to see some of this momentum. So you just have a slightly higher comparison base that it's just going to move the numbers down. So the rate's going to appear to be a little bit lower, but the trajectory is still -- I'd say, is still the same.

It's what I was hoping you'd ask because we have been talking to you about the exchanges not keeping up with retail demand in our product creation, and this has been in the works for a while. We think simple, accessible and design for all is the theme behind Nano, and it's really a simple concept. You take the retail size version of the S&P 500, SPDRs, for example, which is what retail is most familiar with, it's still very expensive. It's a $460 underlying. What we've done is we've done a 1 10 version and made it super simple if you're looking at a derivative screen. If you see the market at the money, it's a 1 week out, it's $2.50 for a call, you're a retail investor, you're like, ""Well, that seems pretty reasonable,"" except I have to multiply that by 100. And what we do on Nano's is, no, it's actually 2 50. And what you see on the screen is what you'd be paying for, that exposure to the S&P 500. So that's really simple. 
And the other confusion we've noticed in retail and talking to retail is, gosh, there's 30 different expiration cycles at SPX, which is awesome for institutional and more sophisticated retail. There's 10,000 different strikes or series. That, in itself, is confusing. With Nanos, we're still finalizing what we're going to offer day 1, but think  4 different exploration cycles, 7 days or less to expiry and maybe 40 or 50 different series. Again, really simple. That's the goal with Nano. It is answering the demand from new retail, and we can't wait to launch this."

But again, we look at it from the perspective of all the participants engaged again to facilitate with all the partners to be able to incent that trading, making it easier, reducing friction, making it affordable. 
And the next question is, well, okay, if you really want to put that in perspective, your entire SPX volume was completely replaced by Nano. Would you be better off? And the answer is yes, would be even better off because, as you know, there's usually a slight premium as you continue to break contracts down by size. So as it gets smaller and smaller, they tend to be a little bit more premium versus, call it, the larger size. So it's -- on a notional value adjusted basis, it's slightly higher, but again, it's -- the pricing is still TBD. Look for progress as we move forward into that launch."

But when we look at retail that's been around for a bit more established broker-dealers the ones I would be trading on over the last years, we have -- they have access to our proprietary products. And from those platforms, there's been incredible growth into our proprietary product set. We've got months over the past couple of quarters of record penetration in our proprietary complex. So that has been pretty terrific, and we've been watching that, as I say, over quarters. 
New retail, the one that -- probably making headlines the most, Webull, in that group had not offered access to our proprietary products or cash settled indices in general. So Webull, as a first mover here, we're not going to trade at all. And other new retail does not offer access to our products either, so all greenfield for us. And then we look -- another measure that's super important to us is the penetration and the use case for one lot trading, and one lot trading for us makes us think that with the very high notional value of contracts in the S&P 500, even super short dated, really is a restriction for some retail accounts who are not capitalized similarly to maybe more traditional retail, there, the birth of Nano. 
So I think we've got a pretty good runway over the next months and watching for the uptake in not only direct access into the products you know, like SPX, but in Nano as we launched Nano. So Chris, over to you."

I'd also mention that they're adding new assets to their platforms and there is an intersection, we think here, over the long term with digital assets as well. Customers, retail customers are going to want to trade multi-asset not just a single asset on a platform. And so many of them are offering that, and we want to provide the ultimate retail investor access to all of our products but through these great intermediaries, these great partners. We're trying to solve the problem with the intermediary. So we're just -- we are going with the trend here and wanting to  provide the access and the products that customers really want."

As we head into year-end, I hope that you're doing well and remaining safe and healthy.
I'm pleased to report on solid financial results for the third quarter 2021 at Cboe Global Markets. For the quarter, we reported revenue growth across each of our business segments, reflecting strong year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring nontransaction revenues, with net revenue up 27% and adjusted EPS up 31%.
Our solid third quarter results were driven by higher volumes in our index options and volatility products, increased demand for our suite of data and access solutions and growth in trading volumes across nearly all our segments. In our proprietary products, ADV increased 29% in VIX futures, 32% in VIX options and 39% in SPX options. We also continue to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV, up 20% year-over-year in the third quarter.
During the quarter, we also delivered on several strategic milestones to expand our global network, including the successful launch of our European Derivatives platform as well as the closing of our acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific. I'll touch on both in a moment.
But first, I want to discuss our plans to enter the digital asset market through the planned acquisition of ErisX, which we announced last week. ErisX will provide Cboe with spot trading, data, derivatives and clearing capabilities for digital assets through its regulated futures exchange and clearinghouse.
The past 2 weeks have been a watershed moment for the digital asset industry with the launch of trading in the first bitcoin ETF in the U.S. equities market. As the appetite for ownership in digital assets continues to grow, we believe Cboe can play a guiding role in shaping the trajectory of this revolutionary market.
Today, we are at a critical inflection point. We're seeing strong retail demand, institutional interest, market growth in streaming of digital assets even with traditional financial firms. As a leading provider of global market infrastructure and tradable products, we can bring the knowledge, structure and transparency of our trusted markets to the digital asset space. The demand and excitement for digital assets is driven by the unique market structure and freedom it affords, and we want to maintain that innovative spirit while providing the regulatory framework and structure that many market participants desire. 
We have secured support from a tremendous group of industry leaders who are aligned with our vision and want to shape and define this asset class now and for the future. These industry leaders bring different perspectives and expertise from retail brokers, crypto leading firms, global liquidity providers and sell-side banks. They are expected to form a Digital Advisory Committee tasked with advising us on the ongoing developments of our digital asset business, Cboe Digital. These industry leaders include DRW, Fidelity Digital Assets, Galaxy Digital, Interactive Brokers, NYDIG, Paxos, Robin, Virtu Financial and Webull. Additionally, certain members of the Digital Advisory Committee intend to acquire minority ownership interest in Cboe Digital. I'm confident that together with ErisX CEO, Tom Chippas, and his team and our incredible partner group, we can not only meet the growing demand for institutional and retail trading solutions but also push the boundaries of digital asset innovation and unlock its next phase of growth.
I'm extremely pleased with the progress we made during the third quarter executing on the 4 key incremental growth drivers I outlined at the beginning of this year: the opportunity to grow recurring nontransaction revenue; the launch of Cboe Europe derivatives; our expansion plans for BIDS Trading and extending access to our products and services across geographies and market participants.
We saw positive momentum in our data and access solutions again this quarter, fueling a 21% increase in our recurring nontransaction revenue. This growth was driven by continued demand for access to our exchanges, proprietary market data and new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms, including Silexx and Trade Alert. We continue to optimize the efficiency and delivery of our data and access solutions to market participants and are excited to launch Cboe Global Cloud, a new real-time, cloud-based, market data streaming service in collaboration with Amazon Web Services, November 1. Cboe Global Cloud is expected to help further extend Cboe's data to new users and geographies, an important step towards broadening investor access to our proprietary content and market data globally.
Turning now to Europe, where we successfully launched the European Derivatives market on September 6. We are very pleased with the initial progress, with trading and clearing running smoothly as we slowly build volume. Over the coming months, we plan to introduce additional products and onboard new participants. Bringing the first truly pan-European transparent and lit derivatives market to Europe is a remarkable achievement, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead.
Additionally, our European Equities business delivered strong results in the third quarter with average daily notional value traded up 29%. Cboe LIS, powered by BIDS, continued to see positive momentum and, for the first time in its history, became the largest block trading platform in Europe for the month of August. BIDS has established itself as the premier block training destination in the U.S. and Europe, and we are excited about our plans to expand the BIDS network to Canada early next year and then to Asia Pacific region to serve an even broader base of customers.
Turning to Asia Pacific. We made good progress integrating the Chi-X team since we closed the acquisition at the beginning of July. We plan to migrate Chi-X to Cboe technology and are busy working through the integration plan and time line. With our expanded footprint in the Asia Pacific region, we see significant opportunity to further develop our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products into one of the world's largest derivatives and securities networks. 
Beginning November 21, we plan to take an important step towards broadening our network and access to our proprietary products through the launch of extended global trading hours for VIX and SPX options as part of our 24x5 initiative. The lengthened global trading hours complement our entry into Asia Pacific and are designed to help meet growing investor demand for the ability to manage risk more efficiently and adjust SPX and VIX options decisions around the clock.
We are also pleased to announce that Webull, a leading retail broker platform with a growing global presence, began offering our proprietary products, VIX and SPX options, on their platform this month. We've continued to see strong demand for SPX options from both institutional and retail broker platforms and are eager to expand access to this product suite. Similar to last quarter, we saw solid growth in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms, with ADV on those platforms up 24% from the second quarter, hitting a new all-time high.
Key to our global network expansion are strong partnerships. And to that end, we were thrilled to expand our relationship with MSCI and extend the licensing agreement that allows Cboe to offer options trading on MSCI global indices through 2031. We have valued our strong relationship with MSCI for many years and look forward to further collaboration in the years ahead, particularly in the important area of ESG investing.
As the retail market continues to grow, we remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. To that end, earlier this week, we announced plans to launch Nanos, a first-of-its-kind options contract designed to make trading more accessible for the retail trader. Increased retail participation has fueled record trading across the industry. Between the top 4 retail broker platforms, there are now more than 150 million retail brokerage accounts, and many of these accounts are too small to take advantage of the potential benefits certain options contracts can offer. We plan to launch our first Nanos product on the S&P 500 Index first quarter 2022. 
At a fraction of the size of the standard options contract, the one multiplier, cash-settled Nanos S&P 500 answers the growing demand for a simpler, more cost-effective way to gain broad exposure to the U.S. equity market. The S&P 500 option market is one of the most highly traded and liquid option markets across the globe. Through our Nanos S&P 500 product, we are broadening access to a greater universe of traders who can enjoy the potential benefits options provide, including hedging, asset allocation and income generation strategies.
To complement the launch of Nanos, the Cboe Options Institute plans to offer a new options introductory curriculum tailored to retail traders. Through our long-standing commitment to education, we are continuously evolving our programs to offer more retail-centric content through the Options Institute, and we look forward to welcoming a new generation of traders to options trading with the launch of Nanos.
As we broaden our global footprint by entering new markets and launching new products and services, we further our goal of expanding access to a broader base of customers, both institutional and retail. By leveraging our technological expertise, customer relationships and capital markets capabilities, we plan to continue to unlock additional revenue opportunities across our businesses.
We head into the final months of the year on a stronger footing than ever, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our growth opportunities ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."

Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 3Q '21 as compared to 3Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.As Ed just indicated, the third quarter was incredibly stron",1322,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 3Q '21 as compared to 3Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.
As Ed just indicated, the third quarter was incredibly strong for Cboe with robust results from both a transaction and nontransaction basis. Overall, adjusted earnings increased 31% versus the third quarter of 2020 and improved off solid second quarter 2021 metrics. As we move forward, we look for the cash, derivatives and data portions of our business to work in unison to enhance revenue opportunities and shareholder value.
Now a quick look at the third quarter. Our net revenue increased 27%, setting a new quarterly record. Net transaction fees were up 39% and recurring nontransaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 29%. Adjusted EBITDA of $240 million was up 25%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.45, up 31% compared to last year's quarterly results.
Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll just provide summary thoughts. While we saw year-over-year growth in all of our segments, our Options segment produced above-average growth for the quarter of 30%, driven by higher trading volumes and revenue per contract in both our proprietary and multi-listed options. Total options ADV was up 23% as we saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. Revenue per contract also moved higher by 16% and given positive mix shift to index products and a strong increase in our multi-listed options RPC, up 23%. And we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in recurring nontransaction revenue. particularly access and capacity fees.
North American Equities revenue increased 13% year-over-year as acquisition-related net transaction and clearing fees were further helped by strong proprietary market data fees and access capacity fees. This was offset somewhat by a 1% year-over-year decline in U.S. Equity ADV and a 1% year-over-year decline in market share for the quarter. While market share trends have been impacted by aggressive pricing trends from some competitors, we remain focused on optimizing the long-term profit in the business through the many initiatives we have introduced or plan to introduce to the market.
For the quarter, MATCHNow and BIDS contributed $8.5 million in net revenue. Lastly, recurring nontransaction revenue increased by more than $5 million or 17%, with organic growth of 14%. 
Third quarter revenue increased in futures by 24% on the back of a 30% increase in ADV and a 6% increase in capture. Looking forward, we were pleased to see the SEC recently approved filings to list and trade shares of 2 new volatility shares products in inverse and long VIX futures ETF. These new listings are likely to increase the VIX trading ecosystem as the AUM builds on those products. 
The revenue increase in Europe and APAC primarily reflects the addition of Chi-X Asia Pacific in July 2021, an $8.2 million contribution, as well as growth in European equities and clearing. Underlying trends remained strong in the third quarter as industry average daily notional value traded, market share on Cboe European Equities and net capture all moved higher on a year-over-year basis.
And finally, revenues in the FX segment increased 8% as compared to the third quarter of 2020 as trading volumes and net capture moved higher. During the quarter, global FX market share had a all-time high of 17%.
Cboe's recurring nontransaction revenue growth remained elevated in the third quarter with year-over-year organic growth reaching 14%. Again, this strong growth was largely a product of additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we saw both physical and logical port usage remain robust in our equities and Options businesses driven by increased demand for trading capacity. And on the market data side, the equities top of book and depth of book products continue to perform well. 
We are increasing our organic outlook by 1 to 2 percentage points to approximately 14%. Our total recurring nontransaction revenue growth is now expected to reach approximately 18% for 2021, up 2 to 3 percentage points versus our prior expectation. Overall, we are very pleased with the continued traction in this business as it's an important element of Cboe's ecosystem of products and services.
Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $140 million for the quarter, up 29% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 17% or $19 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits.
Moving to our expense guidance. We are tightening and raising our expense guidance range for the full year to $536 million to $541 million from $531 million to $539 million. The $4 million increase in the midpoint reflects higher incentive compensation costs, reflecting the strong year-to-date operating results we have posted as well as our plans for increased hiring during the fourth quarter and a slight uptick in our depreciation and amortization forecast. As a firm, we believe in a pay-for-performance culture. And not only has our year-to-date financial performance been strong, we have made significant progress against our longer-term growth priorities, especially towards increasing access to Cboe products and services, as Ed noted previously.
As you recall from our February earnings meeting, we laid out a path for revenue growth that would be preceded by higher-than-normal expense growth that would slightly compress margins in the short term to enable longer-term growth. We remain focused on investing in key initiatives with attractive returns, and we look forward to meeting the current and future market demand by prudently investing organically and inorganically to meet those needs, even if it requires upfront spend.
Now turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are raising our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $38 million to $42 million from $34 million to $38 million due to the earlier timing of various products. Our CapEx guidance range moves $8 million lower to $47 million to $52 million, and we are reaffirming the higher end of our guided tax range of 27.5% to 29.5% for the full year under the current tax laws. Our interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $11.7 million. We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to hold steady in the $11.5 million to $12 million range.
In addition to the investment priorities we outlined earlier in the call, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From a capital return perspective, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend for the 11th straight year, growing 14% on a year-over-year basis. In total, we returned $52 million to shareholders through dividends in the third quarter. Our leverage ratio decreased slightly versus the prior quarter to 1.4x at September 30, as our debt levels remained steady on a sequential basis.
Overall, our balance sheet remains unencumbered as we look to put incremental capital to use in value-enhancing ways for shareholders. Our adjusted cash and financial investments balance is elevated, reflecting the planned use of cash to fund a portion of the planned transactions we recently announced as well as a slightly higher requirement for regulatory capital purposes.
In summary, Cboe delivered a very strong third quarter, and we're even more enthusiastic about the number of high-quality growth initiatives we are bringing into our ecosystem, solutions that extend access to global markets for our customers, grow our geographic footprint and breadth of asset classes and diversify our revenue base. We look for these planned additions to fuel continued growth across the Cboe ecosystem. 
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A."

It might -- we need to get into this space. We launched, if you recall, the first futures contract in 2017 and even before that, we had applications at the SEC for ETNs and ETPs. 
So this space, we've had our eye on. We thought the ecosystem in this space would have evolved a bit quicker. So we've always had an eye on getting back into the space. The last couple of calls, I've been mentioning that.
Importantly, also, we were early investors in ErisX in 2018 when Don Wilson and Tom Chippas saw the opportunity to build out a regulated fair market in spot, derivatives clearing and margining. So long answer to your question, framed that way, we've constantly and since the launch of those futures, consciously been looking for an opportunity that gets us back into the market. 
But John, I think importantly, the rollout, what ErisX is trading today. And what we have in front of us between now and close."

It's also called Eris but that business offers swap futures. They're traded on a competing exchange. 
We're talking about here, ErisX, which is purely a crypto platform. The businesses are completely separate. And what ErisX offers, as Ed mentioned, is a -- really a start-to-finish integrated platform for crypto trading, spot clearing and derivatives. And the platform is live today. So there are significant users on the platform, depending on the day. Some days, it can be really 1 of the top 3, 4 in the market.
The partners that we're bringing to the table here, and you see us mention in the press release, these partners is forming our Digital Advisory Committee. Many of those partners are live today on the platform. So we believe, as we kind of look at the evolution of the space, the partners we're bringing to the table and the readiness of the platform, that our timing really is pretty much spot on here because the technology platform is built, the regulatory approvals are in place.
One thing that we're really looking forward to, as we move towards close and towards evolving the business is the expansion of the derivatives franchise. So again, the regulatory approvals for that platform are all in place. The technology is in place. But what we intend to do is work with the CFTC and gaining approval for margin futures and then other derivatives products, which we think are -- can be game-changing for the industry. There really is nothing like it, settling into the physical coin in an integrated spot clearing and futures and derivatives platform. So we look forward to that build. But really, that's the only piece that is yet to come. The rest is live and poised for growth today."

But if you think about the clearing members, the market makers, the customers that are going to be trading and putting the right incentives in place. 
So what we've done is we've obviously tried to remove those frictional elements to facilitate liquidity and facilitate volume. So there are stipends in place. There are -- there is tiering in place with respect to those elements to, again, to incent those participants. And we'll see that continue to build as we add more and more clearing members, as we add more market makers to both the futures and the options side. So stay tuned for that progress. 
We'll put out some targets at our Investor Day as far as where we think this business can go, call it, in a more of a 3- to 5-year time frame. But I would say right now, as the team has already mentioned, the key success here was the operational element of getting people on the platform, getting it traded. The products are successful from that standpoint. We're achieving the on-screen transparency and liquidity of what we set out to do, and then with the expectation of growing that over time."

And Cboe was, I'd say, first or at the very least, early in building crypto futures in December 2017. You guys had the right call. You were taking a chance. But it seems like CME, I don't know, somehow outmaneuvered you. They were second, but they somehow won. So give us a little context of what happened there. 
And then maybe lastly, Cboe launched bitcoin futures at a peak price and then seemed to change its mind 15 months later at sort of a Bitcoin price trough. Is this flip-flopping going to make it harder for you to be successful in building a futures platform at Eris given that venue commitment is so important in sort of longer-dated products?"

As I said, we really anticipated a little quicker action on approval in the ETN and ETF space. We do appreciate incenting market makers to post quotes and to trade.

I probably would have made a trade there instead of pivoting away and waiting for regulation and design to be more obvious for us with the ecosystem, as we find it today, primed and ready for an exchange like ErisX. 
And significantly, you didn't mention the partners that we're entering this with. Super important. They do see the opportunity to offer their customers access and an experience that they're used to in other asset classes. This is very important. This is not a disintermediated market where we think we should be offering direct to customer. Customers are used to the platform that they trade on. Those partners that we list, we are not getting in between them and their experience. So if they like to pivot from their exposure in options Cboe's proprietary products and on the same platform, be able to trade crypto in a safe, regulated fairway, that's the experience we're looking for.

So there are 5 coins on the platform today, and the platform is highly extensible. So currently under review additional coins and all coins. And it's worth noting that in terms of today's platform, it's one of the newest out there, given the time frame since launch is relatively short. And we believe that it has all the underpinnings to recognize pretty substantial growth. 
It's important to recognize that this -- our involvement in the space is -- and the entire space itself, is in evolution. And so Ed really kind of described nicely our initial foray into it. We call that product version 1.0: cash settled, pretty simple kind of construct. We quickly learned and evolved from those learnings that the industry was demanding something different. They were demanding physical settlement. They were demanding a robust clearing platform that dealt with the underlying spot in conjunction with the derivatives product. 
And so when we decided to take our original v1.0 product down, it was really with a mind towards doing something much more comprehensive to meet the demands of the digital asset space as market participants were telling us they wanted. So that process of kind of getting back into it with the right platform, it took some time. We were waiting for the perfect opportunity. 
I would say that we were attracted to ErisX really because of the comprehensive sort of -- from spot through clearing and data to derivatives. It conforms very nicely with our strategy across asset classes and geographies. 
But as we -- kind of to the evolution theme, as we started down the path of evaluating a deal with Eris and we sampled the market to ensure that we were thinking about things in a way that really resonated with market participants, this is where another step of the evolution came into play, where there was really this obvious demand for participation from market participants to be part of this initiative to be on the cap table, to be aligned with value creation. And so we met that demand with the structure that you saw us announce last week. 
So really evolution, and it's a rapid evolution because the market -- the digital asset space is evolving so rapidly. I don't think we could have really nearly come close to meeting the demand that the market is telling us to have for the particular type of products and services with our prior product in any sense, and this platform does it for us."

And that's a little bit clear what that means when you talk about derivatives. It's a CFTC-regulated platform, both clearinghouse and futures market. 
On the spot side of things, the industry is really hungering for this. Part of the demand we're talking about, hungering for a framework. And so with these partners that we have on board with us, as part of our digital asset advisory committee, we are -- we intend to go to the regulators, work together collaboratively with the regulators and industry to help define what that means product by product, token by token, coin by coin. And we think that initiative and the clarity that, that will potentially bring can unleash the next wave of growth in this space. So that's the opportunity. It's very much regulated together with our market participants.
And then the liquidity out in the market today is really -- it's -- despite the -- some of the regulatory overhang here, the liquidity is impressive. But the growth in the space is so rapid that, soon enough, the platforms and the OTC trading that's occurring out there is going to potentially exceed its capacity.

So it would be premature to give us kind of a run rate versus historical versus where we are. And when we get close to the close date, particularly with -- as we mentioned in our announcement that we're going to have our Digital Advisory Committee, those various partners likely taking the various equity positions in that. 
So those numbers could move a little bit. So we'd only be premature in that overall number. But yes, it's a slight drag on OpEx as we continue to build and as we continue to get scale. So again, more details on that as we get closer. And then Chris Isaacson, I think, is going to wrap it up."

I'd also say, as we looked at this asset, we see that there's a lot -- been a ton of innovation in the digital asset space. But there still remains a trust, transparency and data gap. And we think with ErisX, we can fill that gap, with Tom Chippas and team and the platform they've built, and expand on the vision that ErisX started with because of the partners we're bringing to the table. 
And regarding competition, we won't just have a spot market. We're having a derivatives market that will allow for physically settled futures, margin futures, as John talked about. There's a big and broad vision here that we think we can fulfill with these partners, not disintermediating but embracing them so they can access all the customers, both traditional and nontraditional customers that want to trade digital assets. We'll be able to get to them through these intermediaries and this platform that's going to embrace transparency and regulation as it gets formed and clarified. 
And I think that Tom and team have built this right. They've got the regulatory approvals that are needed. They've got the money transfer licenses in 50-plus states, CFTC approval for a futures exchange and a designated clearing organization.

As far as the growth rate, we continue to see growth. What you're seeing is you're still going to see growth over -- that's projecting growth into the fourth quarter. Over the third quarter, the rate itself may not be as great. And what we saw also -- this is a little bit just kind of more of a math issue, is that the fourth quarter in last year started to pick up where we started to see some of this momentum. So you just have a slightly higher comparison base that it's just going to move the numbers down.

So we're super excited about our entry into Asia with Chi-X Asia. Integration planning is going very well. We plan to bring BIDS to the region within Australia in the second half of 2022. And then the first half of 2022, we'd migrate the Cboe technology in Australia. And then thereafter, we would do Japan also. 
So as Ed mentioned, now we have a bona fide presence in that region, and we are able to sell a full suite of our products, including SPX and VIX options and our growing set of data. So let's -- maybe, Brian, if you can -- you want to chime in at the end here as well."

So I just -- again, continue to hit that, is that the boots on the ground is a key element there as we continue to extend that global network. I think it's important to remember. And what that enables us to do across like all our network and the proprietary products and everything that we have, and then leveraging those learnings. And basically, what does it mean to be an exchange operator, and the consistency and the reliability of what that brings to the various market participants. Because our client base largely is a very global client base. 
The other is that, to mention explicitly, is BIDS, as far as bringing that to market in those geographies, which we talked about. So that's on the time line in conjunction, what Chris mentioned, the platform migration. And then I'll wrap it back up is the broader -- going to keep coming back, is the broader data opportunity here. We talked about how we're not only continuing to go after more share of wallet to meet that increasing demand for data analytics, but a big part of that theme also is this international expansion, the incremental analytics, solving for customer capital/margin needs. 
And then again, in the crypto, which has been brought up a couple of times, is that entire ecosystem of that data need. And it just continues to feed off itself and expand from a data perspective, again, leveraging off the, call it, the cash/equity side of that spot as well as the derivatives and then completing it with the data opportunity.."

Obviously, you've had some success with many VIX and XSP products. But it seems like uptake has been a bit more muted relative to some other retail-oriented index product launches we've seen over the past couple of years. So maybe you can expand upon the Nanos a bit and whether you think this very small contract size will kind of enable you to unlock more growth in that retail segment. And then also from a fee standpoint, is it fair to think about the fee rate being much higher than SPX or even the XSP relative to the notional contract size?"

Because we have been talking to you about the exchanges not keeping up with retail demand in our product creation, and this has been in the works for a while. We think simple, accessible and designed for all is the theme behind nano, and it's really a simple concept. You take the retail size version of the S&P 500, SPDRs, for example, which is what retail is most familiar with, it's still very expensive. It's a $460 underlying. 
What we've done is we've done a 1/10 version and made it super simple if you're looking at a derivative screen. If you see the market at the money, let's say 1 week out, it's $2.50 for a call, you're a retail investor, you're like, well, that seems pretty reasonable, except I have to multiply that by 100. And what we do on Nanos is, no, it's actually $2.50. And what you see on the screen is what you'd be paying for that exposure to the S&P 500. So that's really simple. 
And the other confusion we've noticed in retail and talking to retail is, gosh, there's 30 different expiration cycles on SPX, which is awesome for institutional and more sophisticated retail. There's 10,000 different strikes or series. That, in itself, is confusing. With Nanos, we're still finalizing what we're going to offer day 1, but think 4 different expiration cycles, 7 days or less to expiry and maybe 40 or 50 different series. Again, really simple. That's the goal with nano. It is answering the demand from new retail, and we can't wait to launch this."

Again, it will be a little bit of a repeat story as we kind of framed up, and we talked about the European Derivatives and pricing there, is that you think that it will be obviously notionally adjusted, obviously, from the pricing standpoint. But again, we look at it from the perspective of all the participants engaged again to facilitate with all the partners to be able to incent that trading, making it easier, reducing friction, making it affordable. 
And the next question is, well, okay, if you really want to put in that perspective, if your entire SPX volume was completely replaced by nano, would you be better off? And the answer is yes. You would be even better off because, as you know, there's usually a slight premium as you continue to break contracts down by size. So as it gets smaller and smaller, they tend to be a little bit more premium versus the, call it, the larger size. So it's -- on a notional value adjusted basis, it's slightly higher, but again, it's -- the pricing is still TBD. Look for progress as we move forward into that launch."

But when we look at retail that's been around for a bit, more established broker-dealers, the ones I would be trading on over the last years, we have -- they have access to our proprietary products. And from those platforms, there's been incredible growth into our proprietary product set. We've got months over the past couple of quarters of record penetration in our proprietary complex. So that has been pretty terrific, and we've been watching that, as I say, over quarters. 
New retail, the one that are probably making headlines the most. And Webull in that group had not offered access to our proprietary products or cash settled indices in general. So Webull, as a first mover here, were not going to trade it at all. And other new retail does not offer access to our products either, so all greenfield for us. 
And then we look -- another measure that's super important to us is the penetration and the use case for one lot trading. And one lot trading for us makes us think that with the very high notional value of contracts in the S&P 500, even super short dated, really is a restriction for some retail accounts, who are not capitalized similarly to maybe more traditional retail, the birth of nano. 
So I think we've got a pretty good runway over the next months and watching for the uptake in not only direct access into the products you know, like SPX, but in nano as we launched nano. So Chris, over to you."

But the new retail is just starting, and we're excited with -- that Webull's offered access to SPX and VIX, but we still have a lot of room to grow there. 
I'd also mention that they're adding new assets to their platforms and there is an intersection, we think here, over the long term with digital assets as well. Customers, retail customers are going to want to trade multi-asset, not just a single asset on a platform. And so many of them are offering that, and we want to provide the ultimate retail investor access to all of our products but through these great intermediaries, these great partners. We're trying to solve the problem with the intermediary. So we're just -- we are going with the trend here in wanting to provide the access and the products that customers really want."
